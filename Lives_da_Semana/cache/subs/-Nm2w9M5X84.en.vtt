 of the union a decree was published yesterday where we cut 21 thousand

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.420
 is commission positions trust functions and gratuities and the projection of

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:59.370
 savings per year of 21 thousand positions in the range of R $ 200 million

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.270
 this is our commitment to the campaign house and believes that we can

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.380
 go a little further on this delicious thing that can be used to save money, yes

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:17.459
 tomorrow friday our minister of infrastructure the third was in are

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.620
 paulo the stock exchange where the concession

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:30.590
 I am here to concession 12 airports really seeking to remove from the state if

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:37.129
 this weight of unfortunately where the Brazilian state is hardly things give

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:41.959
 right the example we have the house that will dive deep into the ministry

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.030
 a secretary that there is a lot of things wrong so the certainty that we had is

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.810
 that Brazil had no way to succeed if it continues to do that old policy

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.950
 of negotiation and pev good boys we had in previous governments the

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.200
 tocantins opened up more as a rule the goal is to serve the population and yes

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.920
 meet interest in a few the parliament has understood this with

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.430
 ownership we have no pressure for part ministry

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.970
 of parliamentarians and they largely know that the path is this

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.979
 choosing technical people from the team that do a good job for the

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:31.370
 population bringing to our brazil is two old news should be voted on

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.139
 provisional measure of fraud he then aims here to collect the

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.090
 inss debtors

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.900
 I’m going to talk a little bit here and greet the businessman since our girl

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:54.380
 health is expected is the forecast is 30 days from now but starting to

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.419
 mass vaccination on influenza here in Brazil but a problem that

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:06.729
 anticipated in the amazon state in the great lasts of people who contracted the flu

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:12.050
 aa from tomorrow monday 1 million new vaccines against vaccines

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.940
 will be nothing if one looks at the manaus obviously

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.300
 persecution across the state with the participation of our force is a pleasure

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.720
 so beautiful the word is this year we

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:28.120
 anticipated in the case of amazonas our campaign she will start a

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.260
 normal time he was around she was scheduled for April 20th we

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.730
 I had already anticipated the schedule for the southern region of Brazil a little

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.920
 but there was an abnormal activity in the south zone a very large number with many

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.660
 many deaths so the president asked us to add

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:52.780
 efforts that I thank nato that who produces these vaccines for sus is and we

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:59.500
 we managed to anticipate in almost a month on the 20th of the month little of that and agility

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:07.150
 also at the end of the end of a visa that does the certification in service and today the

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.610
 president gave the final autopsy which was to make the logistics feasible and sends a bullet

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.730
 amazonas i think that even the state secretariat

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:21.070
 receiving and distributing daddies this weekend Monday we already

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:26.350
 was signing the first pregnant women and children that the main izzo group

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:32.620
 then the public to the sound of a lot of organization and then gradually

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.420
 produce vaccines with the rest of Brazil but it was extremely important

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:43.180
 news the commander alan city of the people there from the amazon is coming

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.980
 charging there and we were working exactly to be able to deliver a vaccine

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:53.770
 our public with the strains with the videos that take place there that are sure to go

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.200
 help to control this growing number of subscribers

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.120
 the north region in the amazons if i could choose ours here i will be in the states

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.780
 united right is that in our understanding right if not

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:12.090
 go through this I don't want to hit the press here that almost every day the

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:17.310
 better every day two three four stories against me but not

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.820
 messed with my family that the family is very big in the ribeira valley in são

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:24.840
 Paulo I will have to answer here and here we go

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:30.180
 in 2014 and march 21 my birthday was signed a normative

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:35.190
 where he was present is not a consultant rosinha deputy pt miner from são

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:41.790
 Paulo and he, when saying this in the chamber, I occupied the gallery and said, that is, visual

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:47.610
 normative hit it that brazil would ordinate by month of ecuador

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:54.150
 the equivalent of checking in at ceagesp for a week and although it is not

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.960
 the greatest importance is a great truth banana has always been like this and such

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.940
 at that moment I confess there is consensus in the plenary and we quickly raised how much

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.840
 with the distance from the equator that doesn't border Brazil this band would have to

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:12.450
 go through the Panama Canal 10.009 and then arrived at the port of santos go up

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:17.460
 the mountain and I saw my concern is that the band arrives in a competitive way

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:22.440
 considering that there are 209 on average we have the ribeira valley region where i went

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.830
 raised today I have four brothers who live there

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.050
 yet I also opened it started in wood which is

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:34.740
 very serious under the normative phytosanitary control would be done by the country of

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:39.600
 origin and be the elevator so that everyone there with a coconut tree

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:45.120
 from there to here to são paulo in april started back there comes what happened

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:51.840
 now the week work in the sheet of são paulo jânio de freitas says i'm

00:08:51.840 --> 00:09:00.990
 in this fight because it is a region where the good guys have many companies

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:07.380
 say that no relative of mine has a hectare there back to the band we don't have

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.420
 an air conditioner we have one on my mexico farm

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:16.750
 transporting bananas with nothing at all in regards to this is an accusation that he

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:21.880
 says that his cousin, joseph and 40 does not mention the name of his name, may enter a

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:26.140
 action against him here which is a slander of information and the family gets upset

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:31.930
 the value of pi the poorest region is são paulo taking out cajati the economy

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:39.700
 from that whole region it comes from the banana and it says here that it boots here it says until I

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:44.530
 I promised a nephew my banana grower to end the ghost of gay good price

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:52.360
 better quality of the banana coming from the equator is not true of god lie and

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.350
 I'm just answering that Mr. José de Freitas the outright lie that

00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:00.970
 that messes with my family worth bercow people

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:06.460
 I'm moving there is a has is that the television and the three brothers move with

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:13.140
 real estate cases in the region look it was a ball at zero the first time

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:19.200
 I'm sorry matter in that sense here well let's go ahead

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:26.230
 Sunday morning I and a few more months right

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:30.640
 we will do for the united states we will have a meeting with the president of the

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:37.960
 ago is a lot of things already settled we are at the end mind we intend

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:43.030
 actually sign the agreements do that approach with the united states as

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:47.890
 always said in my pre-campaign and campaign we want to bring the world closer

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:53.980
 the whole united states for us is a great one it can certainly be one

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:58.210
 great partner of our great economic partner is giant in second place

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:03.040
 case even if the first half of the year china china is right so i want

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:08.470
 stop by here beginning this week about something that will happen in the

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:15.300
 united states the president that visits each a natural partnership in the states

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.000
 already joined by the baron of rio branco in the

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.560
 our diplomacy and the relationship of the united states a dimension absolutely

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.259
 essential part of Brazilian diplomacy is the reflection of good management

00:11:27.259 --> 00:11:33.600
 unfortunately in recent times this partnership has been negligence

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.750
 anyone who gets to the good exchange of united states passes in the united states

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:42.060
 the initiative's partnership with the need to win a place in the

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:46.860
 American society is discarded simply giving money

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:51.209
 so it will be a moment to start to resume a natural partnership the partnership

00:11:51.209 --> 00:11:55.410
 that was can be essential again for the development of brazil understanding

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:59.639
 without excluding others - partnerships but then I will give an example of a given

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:03.779
 concrete thing we intend to do will be the signing of a new treaty of

00:12:03.779 --> 00:12:08.100
 a new technological safeguards agreement in the united states and

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:13.550
 will allow commercial use of the Alcantara launch pad

00:12:13.589 --> 00:12:18.600
 this can bring a lot of resources brazil may be the main point maybe

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.980
 starcraft launch and more commercials that was not possible if they hadn’t

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.579
 this being an agreement because without an agreement it is possible to use technology

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:28.920
 American in these technology launches

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:34.500
 American nobody launched then each one an example of something that the

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:39.300
 resumption of a natural partnership can bring to Brazil

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:44.959
 in addition, we also intend to do several things in many areas such as

00:12:44.959 --> 00:12:53.310
 energy as a security and defense as biodiversity as the partnership

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:58.680
 economy and the environment puts a positive emphasis on agriculture is and in other

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:04.079
 including areas is also the defense of democracy mainly of

00:13:04.079 --> 00:13:09.750
 defense of democracy here in our region if especially to venezuela in

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:18.240
 which we are acting in a very unfortunate way and takes away some of the elements that

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:24.269
 are there in our American just proves that it will continue in the matter of appearance

00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:28.589
 alcantara average since the squid government we tried this agreement and we didn’t have

00:13:28.589 --> 00:13:32.910
 much more successful for the ideological position than a technical issue

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:36.839
 so the agreement now signed will now pass through parliament it is important the

00:13:36.839 --> 00:13:43.410
 staff really is to understand that it is important to be present yes for

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:48.269
 mayor governor but also for state federal senator and councilor and

00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:51.569
 basically goes through the foreign and international relations committee of the

00:13:51.569 --> 00:13:56.430
 two houses and then by the plenary it is very important that we are losing

00:13:56.430 --> 00:14:00.209
 money in that region a long time ago it is possible to launch a satellite in the world

00:14:00.209 --> 00:14:05.540
 all over there and this one we all intend to do what knows how to transform this area

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:10.829
 from the state of Maranhão takes an area that will really bring profit for all of us

00:14:10.829 --> 00:14:16.709
 I already have a question that is not exactly the United States but the

00:14:16.709 --> 00:14:20.910
 question of how much we have with brazil back in the military passport

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:26.370
 Brazilian government and is within the 100-day program within the 100 days of government

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:33.029
 the new passport coat of arms of the pride of Brazilians is now ready

00:14:33.029 --> 00:14:36.930
 of the new passport will pass on another subject we have also found

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.319
 some time our third start of

00:14:40.319 --> 00:14:43.110
 infrastructure suddenly manages to override the card on the

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:48.000
 mercosur because i think there is no municipality

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.189
 believing in the cars there in the training also have a benefit for Brazil

00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:57.130
 this plate of mercosur the enterprise is an expense more to

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:00.880
 population let's try so tried the same cool way

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.090
 I think we can find a solution, we ended up with this Mercosur plate

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:10.450
 it was also then that in relation to the united states and it will be the beginning of a

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:15.180
 piece is going to be launched several things are going to be part of a work program that

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:20.260
 will be implemented like that from then on, it is with this conviction that for example

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:25.690
 the economy is the connection in brasilia when the american is fundamental is

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:30.690
 know what you do is a lot from the private sector so we will have

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:37.780
 new instruments that are being deprived here to be articulated and our initiatives that

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:44.050
 can take advantage of this extraordinary business community

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:51.190
 American investment and the wealth it generates is American investment in Brazil

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:56.290
 not only the production but its knowledge technology and innovation innovation in the area

00:15:56.290 --> 00:16:00.610
 evidently in the comics the fear that Brazil has a lot to gain from the

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:08.500
 special partnership in this area so I think that all these environments come out all

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:15.550
