 another 60 years increases a little bit, you know, the base fifteen percent was arrested for

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.249
 percent so every 100 people over 60 years old which is my case may have

00:00:57.249 --> 00:01:01.749
 complications there may be more serious complications then i'm wearing a mask

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:06.400
 because our recent trip to the united states one of the people who come with me

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.929
 on the flight and when he went down in são paulo he went to do

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:17.420
 the usual exams and it was positive with everyone's head I was not going all

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.770

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.850
 difference saying there it was negative hopefully this one works with this cold

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.630
 if it was true, you know, but it didn't work yet it will have been in the next few

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.649
 hours has the result here of mine and a few more people who were

 we signed a big agreement that depends on the parliament's entry into force i

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.500
 I sent the deputy up here so you know how it works it is something

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.489
 in defense, right, today there is included research development test and

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:53.959
 evaluation then we are we are if the congress always approves our

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:58.969
 congress there it is if congress approves we will be the 15th country to make this agreement

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:07.420
 with the united states this is very good for us because investment defense

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.620
 and we also had on the spree remember she will not go into details one thing

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.989
 important here because politics is always right when the region there

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.270
 saints guarujá and são vicente at 10 days was committed in torrential rains where

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.850
 many people lost their lives on the same day our minister misdemeanors

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.319
 regional marine rogério called the mayors of santos guarujá and are

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.370
 vicente made himself available and on the same day also the best on the day

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.350
 following our gil difference coffee went to the region and all measures

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.660
 applicable to the government as long as requested by the mayors and which one is legal

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.310
 met with for example was released to come here until separate to the bpt for

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.440
 situation of the guarujá person so we are doing our part the army

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.860
 Brazilian in particular you live effective, but also present the Navy of

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.350
 nazca had their men at the disposal of these from this municipalities to

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.849
 delivery of basic basket the delivery of water and some more

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.829
 jobs that could be done using manpower to be personal have as the

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:22.250
 means that the armed forces is owns then staff was attended to had the

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.599
 participation not the other way around here a politician had the region always did

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.680
 lying, you know, saying he’s doing it, I’m not worried about who’s doing it

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.299
 right we have to do is state municipality and union of mayors are concerned

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:40.069
 with that and the president also last news came here more often

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.319
 everybody's interested, we're on, her mother is worried, you know, the

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.519
 fuel dropped an average of thirty percent a few days ago had a crisis the

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.439
 Brazil I don’t like it I think they say we’re going up thirty percent

00:03:54.439 --> 00:04:01.250
 a fight there from Saudi Arabia with russia is an excess of oil in the

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.829
 market the price fell and I saw you there in the salon today I don't know the right percentage

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:10.920
 it was quite is another sixth drop in the price of

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.660
 diesel and gasoline here in Brazil is up to the arm that has its policy

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.549
 tied to the international price of oil so stay out there that's the

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.710
 petrobras police fall that gave also do not know a fake news there that the government

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.480
 would be interested in increasing the federal tax the case of the seed so that the price

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.210
 it's never not true it's there yes now I determined that the law that is

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:42.210
 comply with the petrobras policy, I don't interfere until now when someone

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.710
 want to interfere from the outside then I interfere so that there is no interference so the

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.940
 people wait here at the end of the line the price of fuel will fall because never

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.740
 fell if i'm not mistaken is in rio de janeiro and february in the little piece of

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.980
 in March we lowered the fuel price by almost twenty percent at the refinery and I

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.370
 I wait for you I have no power for that someone wants to charge you cannot charge

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.420
 cover me with your governor now

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.940
 and go to the guy at the gas station you can lose tv and the question is

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.430
 why didn't he download black with the reason to tell you why he

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.330
 didn’t find it because the price of ours is almost people percent cheaper

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:25.550
 taking into account the price of the first January of the current year

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.170
 my side here our language interpreter okay she went to put a

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:34.970
 appropriate mask for that to pass my side that I still remain under

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.910
 suspect one of the people here seeing plane with us has already given results

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.320
 negative the used tire negative and everyone is expected to be negative too

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.940
 stay positive just because of the fact that he's there in são paulo now 40 years old

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.760
 he is fine, he is fine, clinically, well, I sent this one, let's go inside, let's go

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.260
 this virus there the coronavirus is to scare good first who's looking at

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.890
 masked people here the interpreter the brand president everybody

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.910
 used to seeing that broad smile from the president came in a mask and saw the

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.200
 minister with this mask is different hers is blue and mine but this shape

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.700
 here is for us to show how people for example if you go to

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:20.570
 doctor and you have look I had this whole process here the person had he will give you

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.220
 meet with a mask like this is the reason we put it on to show how

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.559
 if you are not wearing a glove I washed the

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:33.839
 alcohol gel hands when you leave here alcohol gel or gel right there on the table

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:38.909
 president here so when I need it when the appointment is over the doctor will

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:46.199
 pass the alcohol gel he can finally take the correct measures we pass

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:51.689
 as well as how japan is distancing people asking

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:56.089
 mainly for people we will take care of the elderly who are the ones who

00:06:56.089 --> 00:07:01.919
 complicate children the vast majority make 30 40 percent have the virus and do not even have

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:08.399
 symptom it only serves to pass on but they are the ones that will bring the

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:13.349
 block then everyone has a competent immune system then the virus

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:18.779
 will fall in china it has already happened it has already happened as china started to count

00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:22.919
 from january january february march but in china we know that

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:28.390
 started back in November so what will take a while when

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:33.400
 people will have colds flu we will protect our elderly which is the

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:39.520
 big problem of the virus when a lot of people are at the same time get the virus the

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.560
 elderly people who complicate at the same time go to the hospital and that’s what we’re

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:50.280
 reinforcing the copper cti bed right we had the carnival two weeks ago right

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:55.630
 whoever against the cell phone now it's time for him to come out is not it now

00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:00.550
 is the average incubation time when the person comes into contact they say it is

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:05.890
 from 3 to 5 days with the peak on the fourth day but there are people who say it can be in the

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:11.350
 seventh or eighth more so the carnival served more to the Brazilians who

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:15.460
 went to europe were thalles father listen to what almost the majority of cases

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:21.400
 it was a Brazilian who came from Italy here, we noticed and saw

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.550
 the cases today even have a history of the ship there that starts to be seen ship

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:31.250
 and from italy for us to get patience the young girl how is it how is it

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:36.440
 our 55,000 river is there our young woman to transmit knowledge where not

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:43.550
 Okay, I even sent one, it’s already planned in the movement for Sunday, the grandmother

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:48.950
 Sunday is right there are people sharing it there will not work until

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:52.430
 I recorded a speech that will happen in a little while 20 and 30 I will not

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.570
 enter bh from here I recorded a pronouncement that is worth the 20 and 30

00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:01.490
 obviously this movement in my understanding that no I was not the one who

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:05.540
 programmed is a spontaneous popular spontaneous movement and you with political

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:09.260
 right, everyone wants a coffee with the people, but not just a partner during the

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.550
 elections have to be during a pain so it gives all the people wanted to go

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:18.980
 manifesting against or in favor we have no problem so a certain division is

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:24.710
 in view of more people who can join that day help me to pay

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:28.079
 so the side we will see afterwards are

00:09:28.079 --> 00:09:32.009
 Paulo present the subways it must be full out there the buses from Rio de Janeiro

00:09:32.009 --> 00:09:36.089
 so full january i think campo grande mato grosso do sul also the bus in this

00:09:36.089 --> 00:09:43.110
 side of there so it is has an aspect has an aspect has to take into account has

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:47.819
 there is more a grouping of people ok then the population is a little

00:09:47.819 --> 00:09:51.839
 when divided a lot of people come in I go to my wife and kids I didn't see

00:09:51.839 --> 00:09:56.790
 not my father my grandfather who is close to there don't go there so I have to see this

00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:02.149
 air movement on the 15th, in a little while, putting the church there talking about access

00:10:02.149 --> 00:10:10.499
 what we should do now is to avoid and the plane there is an explosion of people

00:10:10.499 --> 00:10:14.550
 infected because hospitals would not give a flow

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:20.939
 this is the x of the question if you take any action sorry sorry and then

00:10:20.939 --> 00:10:25.540
 of that was a certain limit no longer gives as the system does not support weight

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:30.399
 and then problems happen, people are favorable because people end up dying

00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:34.209
 for another reason I’m going to say here the corolla is now the president of

00:10:34.209 --> 00:10:39.430
 republic i have to take a stand please although the movement is not

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:43.810
 mine enters spontaneous and popular but you have it so what is it

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:52.480
 in a little while it will be 8:30 ok one of the ideas right there is to suspend postpone from here

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:58.360
 a month two months has already been given a tremendous message for the map here the

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:03.009
 payment message was anything so I remembered those amendments and the

00:11:03.009 --> 00:11:09.009
 rapporteur understood that he will have autonomy for series c billion of

00:11:09.009 --> 00:11:18.060
 real or not she was not given let me try I have bought a

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:25.690
 is to take the rest I go to court but there was a problem on the internet

00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:29.740
 and we’re basically going to close now I just asked

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:35.320
 for the one-handed guy, I'm 64 years old if I give up the house in a little while

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:40.660
 and the positive test, right, don't see my case, is that I do it for people more than

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:45.940
 60 years runs that she cuts the rigid 64 year old man who does his

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:51.790
 hiking has already passed its organism through aggression was that stab until today barely

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:56.820
 explained, right, but finally he overcame his strong immune system

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:03.460
 but the vast majority do very well thank you makes a cold

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:09.130
 flu has to be careful on behalf of other people if it is positive

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:13.080
 president is going to have to dispatch from here we are going to recommend the isolation

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:18.580
 if it is not positive or from another virus that is more common than the

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:23.340
 influenza we release life that goes back to normal everybody taking care

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:28.900
 respiratory etiquette use alcohol gel wash your hands and let's get on with life and

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:33.430
 week by week we will see we will fight a lot there will be good days will

00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:38.000
 have difficult days but with brazil it will come out of this I think a

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.170
 time that everyone takes special care of themselves can lead to

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:46.640
 normal life is this the Japanese take care of the elderly a lot right there

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:51.890
 there is no asylum the eldest son is the one who takes care of father and mother of grandfather and grandmother so there

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:56.720
 they are managing to take care of the elderly when, for example, we are going to finish class

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.829
 tomorrow dad and mom take the child and send it to grandma's house we're taking

00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:06.140
 children who are mostly asymptomatic carriers of glass

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:11.420
 to stay inside the home of the elderly we will take care of nursing homes

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:16.820
 let's drive as best as possible and let's pass everyone together

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:21.740
 good people thank you very much for the audience for the opportunity we ask

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:27.110
 God this problem comes out soon decipher here in our country we will

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:31.670
 normality is okay, we are facing the issue of scholarship

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:35.310
 values ​​that plummet dollar going up is happening

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:41.310
 hello all the economic measures the economic team has taken now we are not

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:45.180
 that power that we have in abundance like united states that can

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:49.830
 be to occur with much more property for example the small

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:53.839
 companies we don’t have this facility we all have a seated cast budget

00:13:53.839 --> 00:13:57.630
 more than ninety-three percent of our budget is expenses

00:13:57.630 --> 00:14:01.680
 you can relocate very little water and you release five

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.100
 bibles in some in the provisional measure to be the measure to use five tomorrow

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:11.610
 billion for health for exactly the coronavirus issue that's it more

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:15.610
 one thing but in the end we’re together we’ll take care of our president now

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:20.610
 and 86 has our our launch we are we want to collaborate

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:25.060
 we recognize the legitimacy of the movements people know it but with

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:28.930
 caution and chicken soup I will not say that the politician who is afraid of the people does not

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:32.579
 have to be positive will be the politician of a mandate only that the people on the streets

 democracy is his right against or in favor of whoever is obviously of the

00:14:44.529 --> 00:14:49.149
 my part is no one can attack parliament the executive or judiciary has

00:14:49.149 --> 00:14:55.110
 people who are not in agreement and what do you think you have to

00:14:55.110 --> 00:15:00.000
