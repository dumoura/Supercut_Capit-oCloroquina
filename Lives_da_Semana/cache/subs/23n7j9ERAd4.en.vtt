 São Paulo since yesterday it would privatize the ports of santos are

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.400
 sebastião this year the governor most voted to disinform does not mean

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.430

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:34.229
 informing allowed them that information about it in the one who can speak for

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:44.159
 less am I didn't leave the truth we worked the state helped the police to

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:52.340
 get to where the Flemish put pressure on us

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.130
 we recently visited the codeba and our visit is very successful.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.600
 here we can certainly have news in the port of santos too

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.800
 with this visit is monday please who talks about federal works of

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.890
 actions is the emotional

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:35.190
 - I was better and today the world’s opinion of the globe was reaching the newspaper and

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.240
 safety we come to a new tire and it is not a

00:02:39.240 --> 00:03:03.180
 the singer says it’s not conceivable the organism put pressure on the

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.040
 ring ring is not a sovereign organ they are autonomous they are independent but not

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.480
 about inheritance is my opinion okay I have every right in the world

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.810
 work so that dell does not tax the energy produced by lightning

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.709
 solar and period I talked with rodrigo maia I talked

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.200
 with the day with the name we are on the same team so the ring retreats but if we here

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.510
 rodrigo maia said that he was right to urgently put a project

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:40.590
 not to tax solar energy and obviously I was not going to veto the agency lost the globe

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.150
 that now that the agency has more power than the republic's plan and the congress

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.900
 national so don't give a newspaper the globe can invent

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.350
 another the other play and play the pressure to

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.890
 up and not worth and even more you from the globe here I am

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.959
 working so that the ethanol produced in the plants can be sold directly

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:09.300
 for gas stations remove the monopoly from the middle of the road

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:15.690
 dora turn a truck takes the ethanol produced at the plant walks 200 300 km to

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.700
 take this distributor around 300 that will not deliver the

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.050
 ethanol on the side of the plant, we can avoid walking 500 with

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.790
 accent 600 km only this truck delivers on the side the ethanol will arrive cheaper

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.620
 at the end of the line 20 cents is little is but it is one thing doing my part is

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:41.280
 what I can do now that I intend to make the newspaper the globe is to do

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.670
 with the icms to be charged for the price of fuel at the refinery and not at the end

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.850
 at the gas pump in the front, which means that every time there is

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.080
 any readjustment down here readjust very badly at the end of the line

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.760
 nowadays the average icms 30% of the pump price we are going to round the numbers

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.490
 here the Gazeta r $ 2 is owned by the gas station in

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.890
 refinery in ceara would end $ 5 at the pump

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:19.650
 governors as a rule apply icms which on average 30% at the end of line 1 50

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:25.169
 then that of the after that will sell 4 80 will be penalized twice that he

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:31.140
 will pay the icms on top of a value that did not practice what I intend to do

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.400
 I know if I can get it to cover the percentage that is cute

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.310
 the state's attribution is mine but it charges over the price of the refinery at the price

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.150
 final and if we manage to make the delivery

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.380
 direct influence of ethanol also influences the price of gasoline because

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:55.650
 gasoline 1 6 gasoline has a percentage of a day said i'm doing

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.510
 mine can now the press, no more to see that it is not enough lies and

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:05.370
 disrupted the globe stops disrupting Brazil is disrupting Brazil with

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.870
 these lies the agency repeat has no more power than

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.250
 that the president of the republic i legislative power together does not have and can have

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.930
 sure good new news right along with rodrigo maia ow with 99

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.160
 we will lightly announce it is for everyone that I have talked to them will

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.400
 arrive we are arriving at a great deal

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.259
 to really streamline some guidelines like for example in the question will

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:38.220
 back on the agenda here the question of changing the heart of traffic

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:43.060
 I've been talking to rodrigo maia tasso draw with that he has his problems

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.410
 in the chamber because the chamber commander is not the president and has pressure on

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:53.110
 on top of it also the idea if everything goes well and withdraws from the project even though I

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.310
 I presented about the traffic coordinator and individually present a

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:02.199
 project just to deal with the validity of the license the driver five to ten years

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:06.910
 and full stop and then the congress decided whether or not it was favorable

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:12.970
 the rapporteur regrettably thinks that the validity goes to 10 years until 45 of

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:17.349
 age who is 46 is already old

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:22.710
 that's the opinion of the rapporteur is the deputy side of maranhão

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:28.870
 and we think it’s not as old as 65 from 65 years old and every five years

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:33.610
 depending on me i would hit 75 and another one that killed paul da via as his part

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:39.520
 boot up to 75 years old, I'm 64, 65 here in two months

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.960
 okay i think i'm still young and we can move on to 75

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.860
 then he faces another project to serve there, the professionals are on the street

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:54.009
 is the taxi rank of uber is the van is by bus and the truck pass 20

00:07:54.009 --> 00:07:59.889
 for 40 points to lose your wallet because of the amount of fixed radars

00:07:59.889 --> 00:08:03.970
 and furniture that the poor rally driver in Brazil has with a

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:09.130
 bastard and loses quickly and quickly reaches 20 points and often

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:15.669
 he drove with an expired license and passes by is committing another crime

00:08:15.669 --> 00:08:22.030
 so the citizen who has a family who needs the wheel right to work

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:26.380
 ends up being prevented from working this guy is going to do what catches you here i'm

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:32.160
 here guarujá picks up the Santos once without a good gps and connected with who

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:38.770
 the satellite to point out has yesterday where there is radar including the radar hidden in the

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:45.520
 hidden bush help asking for justice asking for justice work

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:51.340
 also comes to me is this cesar bumbling radar and it helps to have more

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:56.440
 accident even though the driver is concerned about the track with his

00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.850
 sinuosity he is worried in the ravine he is seeing that one is so weak

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:06.070
 that there is someone there that will change then other good news that I have for

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:11.260
 ahead as we had a today congratulate the day play federal supreme court

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.710
 congratulate andré mendonça our attorney general of the union

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:20.800
 the historic day of an injunction against the dpvat given that senator does not speak

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:29.410
 thin heater that speaks fine send a fault that entered dpvat account

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:35.920
 obviously the injunction exists for that, the data doesn’t also need worldwide

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:40.150
 gave an injunction, the mendonça minister entered the circuit with his team

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:45.220
 is on duty at the appealed together the minister gave luck to the sun

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:52.390
 recognized that he could learn here in the hairstyle by andré mendonça and so it was

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:58.690
 done dpvat returned the reasonable value is very low

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:08.110
 because insurance and if you have billions to collect billions guarani needs to have a

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:10.660
 so high value the lowest value a little bit

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:17.800
 those people who didn’t like it considered bad to lose and lose will not have more

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:24.070
 party in dpvat is to become a common mecha of fraud in dpvat there

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:28.720

 better pernambuco will be better then the inter osama there what will you say then

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:56.800
 whoever wants to invest in solar energy in that region is an opportunity and if

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.330
 you invest in solar energy you sell to whoever you want using

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:06.340
 your physical means if you want to use other wire means that that is there

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:11.290
 in the matter of followers do you go to an agreement now if you want solar energy

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:17.560

 60% and the globe defended the newspaper taxation here for heaven's sake

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:36.610

00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:43.990
 I am in line with Article 4 of the convention that ours we have given is

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:49.870
 we govern ourselves, right, in terms of international relations in defense of peace

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:54.310
 and in the repudiation of terrorism speak no more

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:59.470
 Okay and this morning I posted a story on

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:07.670
 facebook an image a story 2009 2009 year squid embraced ahmadinejad do

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:15.920
 iran and 110 the poster boy for iran so that the month and country develops the

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:22.580
 its uranium enrichment technology second and second squid for

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:28.370
 peaceful purposes that time knows that the head of that state said he would

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:34.400
 sweep israel from the map the neighboring state there so squid was there being a boy

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:39.080
 marina advertising as head of the emerging nation so that it did not recognize

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:44.240
 uranium at your leisure access some in the comment saying that the

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:49.780
 Brazil also develops energy, it could also develop, but here we are

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:56.750
 we are there after all we are there we have an agreement with the international agency

00:13:56.750 --> 00:14:01.490
 atomic energy we are inspected and we don't even dream

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:06.650
 in developing enrich uranium so that it can be used for a one

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:10.460
 nuclear artifact has a very big difference in Brazil to other countries that

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:16.280
 so they seek nuclear energy but for purposes of which they could warlike then the

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:21.260
 Brazil is calm about this issue and nobody will want to criticize because I'm

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:26.170
 defending peace and repudiation of terrorism in accordance with article 4 of

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:32.390
 constitution dear marcos mion is laborious but not

 working for some time for people who are autistic

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:52.940
 it became a reference a few weeks ago the times is it was the work

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:58.070
 we triggered a law so that in the

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:04.970
 near dbg census had a face destined to register the autistic ones

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:08.840
 in Brazil it's okay congratulations a final and now

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:15.950

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:28.430
 free identification of the person with autism spectrum disorder ensures

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:32.750

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:57.350
 palace but it was not possible to do it when it ends here from the 15th

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:01.540
 I'm not mistaken, everyone goes back to work in the executive branch

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:09.920

 face the guy from this and from the bar a palm tree from that 10 meters 45 degrees

 mourning he closes the door at 80 degrees and a microwave to pee is suitable

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:53.600
 this is appropriate they want to assemble because of that they have a shirt at the same table

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:10.040
 same fine teacher on the guy who had no point book

 the staff was cutting it was scaled even hurt whole number is 45 degrees

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:19.100
 the guy on a rig stays sweating in the shade

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:25.310
 Missing point book is very expensive but it is one thing it doesn’t you know people don’t

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:28.700
 it can't be produced in brazil so i talked by phone the year

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:32.990
 past the guy who asked 'why was the deputy deputy do I have to

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:37.400
 work two years to pay this fine and everyone gets there in a car

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:45.680
 armored with air conditioning to set the guys up like that

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:49.730
 getting printed financing the fine in ten years so you can't work in

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:52.010
 Brazil people have days when I'm screwed

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:56.510
 unemployed worker a micah blow that will not cut but it was

00:22:56.510 --> 00:23:02.240
 carnauba there will not cut more because the guy there the plan gives more does not want to be

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.520
 patron one more i will apply the money somewhere very

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:09.530
 difficult to apply now that the selic rate goes up 4 and 6 percent we don't have to

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:14.240
 make life easier for those of the bosses will give jobs

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:18.980
 if you end up with the bosses they don't have a job and they have a race they are the ones

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:22.610
 always right to him the worker's account he iron

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:27.680
 worked helps the boss it is easier to defend the worker to have more vote and

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:33.890
 often the 8th biennial as an irrigation even for the worker but to be that boss

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:37.970
 special union guy is going to be a boss peace is to see how hard it is to be

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:43.330
 patron of life and having hit that indication ahead

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:51.730
 we didn't show up but there is something else I'm taking the boss is has that

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:58.960
 fine on the wheel the 50% fine the dismissal without cause the paper when you send

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.770
 although who is not out of malice put it because it is not producing anymore it is

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:09.130
 having damage in evil or that putting a better king putting someone better than

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:15.070
 that guy who was working more than in the last 50% fine of the fund

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:18.820
 guarantee for unfair dismissal we went to 40 is not that passed

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:26.170
 for 40 the 10% will stay with me executive the German and there are people complaining

00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:30.820
 who is complaining will be boss knew how soft and tying it is good to be

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:34.450
 boss in brazil the little woman who drew in brazil so they had 10 per

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:38.710
 cent to take the burden off is what we can do to help whoever

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:43.270
 undertakes, right, to help the bosses, businessmen in Brazil and another thing that

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:46.840
 there has to be actually a boss and employee

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:51.940
 playing a lot that if the company is going well it's in the face that there will be some

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:56.980
 good thing for those who are employed as well but that's ok now I'm just going to leave the

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:01.960
 curiosity here, right, this fine of dismissals without

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:05.200
 just cause that in brazil 50% went to 40

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:10.630
 I don’t know how many in Argentina were increased, because it was a move

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:14.260
 according to the new president of argentina to avoid resignation

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:17.950
 well obviously the boss working now on firing is going to have to sell the

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:23.710
 car the chicken the mother-in-law parrot the house to pay a fine so no will not will not

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:27.280
 dismiss on the other hand also will not catch

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:32.590
 the only good thing in argentina sooner or later will start to

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:36.760
 argentinian businesswoman open her business there in the other place the show there in rio

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:39.220
 great southern another sure will end up happening

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:44.770
 here three sessions of chasing boss doesn’t work out what the trend is to follow

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:49.930
 boss only in socialist regimes where everything is the state in venezuela everything already

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:55.060
 I was now in Cuba all over the state for lack of living a wonder goes there in

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:58.210
 venezuela for you to contact the minimum wage how much is

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:02.710
 that there is retirement and labor rights there is nothing else

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:07.480
 take the dog words and will leave the dog there so that it is done the

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:13.510
 union dog cat barbecue gets the ball touches the boat and recipe

 did he get the recipe already walking it was there the cintra marcos

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:28.960
 but he learned a little more 54 tons of cocaine at the nagoya last year

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:35.380
 it’s a good competition good the federal police don’t see who undertakes more there ok

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:44.130
 the amount seized by the revenue exceeds 80% learned learned in 2018

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:50.230
 is ending but one thing here the collection of hotels here hospitality

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:56.560
 Brazil is an exceptional place for tourism is missing and so are you

00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:04.900
 sculptor is stimulated, for example, noah psb and randy fenoli aa

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:11.290
 park concession was given and the concession was granted in 2012 will

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:14.740
 by 2025 you will be this boring naked field

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:22.660

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:27.430
 to do can do that is fine for everything that is on the side read a paradise of a

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:33.190
 of the people who decided to do it took for themselves it was the ninth final is you have doing

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:38.350
 wrong okay just get in touch with the minister tourism got in touch

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:43.780
 with ricardo salles environment or with gilson that embratur tell us the conditions

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:49.060
 where I belonged I disclose what is right tocantins

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:56.020
 noronha is that I be look just look I didn't have a tower there

00:27:56.020 --> 00:28:01.780
 wind energy one day a guy from the icm-bio stopped by

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:07.600
 saw dead bird in the same commotion is a dead bird that was that week

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:11.950
 slowly the state bird being reviews the

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:18.910
 hit died well no more tact and they stopped now energy is now another

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:27.520
 technique even look just believe me if you want to whoever you want there’s one

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:34.530
 oil power generator that charges the battery of electric cars does not

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:41.650
 understood this way brazil has been talking and carlos ayres new concessions ends with

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:45.670
 the game makes you want to join a flying woman

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:51.490
 on the island but we cannot do that there will honor the commitments made

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:54.910
 by dilma in 2012 the same company that manages in the morning

00:28:54.910 --> 00:29:00.700
 as a girl and also to the Redeemer Christ, he also manages the mouth of the

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:06.010
 iguaçu a harry mine and there in the redemptive christ in the river there is also a

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:12.310
 serious problem and it is a serious problem so when tourism is exploited in this way

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:18.190
 way for the group to get along there is no tourism here the advancement of Brazil is

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:22.440
 being done because it took the four countries united states importance

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:29.020
 australia helps there canada and japan and for them there is no need to give reciprocity

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:34.840
 of view can come here without any strength we cannot speak are you talking to

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:38.950
 this scoundrel our house there is no desire here to stay here now

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:45.520
 many Brazilians are not all but you can take advantage of a situation like this

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:49.600
 so there is no reciprocity at sea so it’s valid for us

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:57.130
 I'm going to India now, at the end of the month, wait and maybe even be able to exempt

00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:00.760
 also for some indians is brazil are doing the same with regard to the

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:06.010
 china we put tourism to work here in brazil so look at the

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:11.550
 occupation of the hotel now in the month of December and if we were an example for

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:18.330
 december bahia lagoons 95 percent of occupied rooms

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:24.490
 rio grande do norte and pernambuco 90% occupied did not have

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:34.740
 January's annual pass illusions January's 98% occupancy rate sold

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:39.480
 all right on the other Monday a new record

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:48.070
 we pass the proposal of do here in brazil more than 500 thousand people 46 in

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:53.020
 transatlantic reached the river in the next ten days 46 3 to 3 we have not

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:59.230
 this is a pity that we have a terrible governor of horrible january

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:04.600
 in every way that it could really is a special treatment of

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:08.680
 security kant these people here but if even the people are going to the

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:18.030
 our january january everyone is this and atlante is 25% higher compared to 2009

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:22.510
 it was in January a little more than a thousand international flights are scheduled for

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:32.050
 week brazil is walking folks walking next tuesday is we have the

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:36.730
 first meeting of ministers in Brasilia where the staff will arrive with the

00:31:36.730 --> 00:31:40.840
 recharged battery we also if someone arrives with the battery

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:44.980
 charged and recharges on time and and we will continue with the same intensity to

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:49.000
 help brazil really get out of the complicated situation that is still

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:56.550
 finds for the good of all of us i see the right is that it speaks of a job

00:31:57.210 --> 00:32:01.510
 or mutuá is an uninformed person here in the last

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:05.310
 year is still missing December right but

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:10.330
 we will surpass a little 1 million new jobs created last year

00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:15.940
 and we intend it is not easy to continue on the same beat continue on the same beat

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:20.830
 we have to de-bureaucratize to deregulate lack of reform

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:27.730
 legislative reform is still lacking is taxing the

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:33.880
 as i'm talking about here is a would be nice if the fuel icms were

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.900
 buy was paid taking into account the sold there

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:43.350
 there at the refinery and not at the pump today on average 30%

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:48.419
 if you were charged down there and I pass you to 100% the governors law only

00:32:48.419 --> 00:32:54.059
 to 100% cms it’s up to you to continue charging the israel bomb now

00:32:54.059 --> 00:32:59.520
 this is a crime with the consumer who has been putting my account

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:05.700
 this high price of gasoline fuel ok I think that the year 2010 in

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:12.179
 [ __ ] you reached 3 in the end 3 50 was a good size is reaching 50

00:33:12.179 --> 00:33:16.380
 is more and we will share the responsibility

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:22.890
 it is as if a cockroach helps to transport everything cheaper in Brazil the freight has dropped

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:29.039
 price says the price drop you help everybody we're going to do the opposite

00:33:29.039 --> 00:33:34.200
 instead of increasing strength or decreasing that what the economy running the most is

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:38.760
 wins but at the end of the line now it's not easy

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:43.350
 I want to thank that the people who are collaborating with the creation of the new

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:47.900
 party to the alliance for brazil

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:54.990
 the interested person not here helping us has to recognize the paid firm at the registry office

00:33:54.990 --> 00:34:00.090
 about five reais and some cases they have to send me to run here

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:05.250
 so short there, after all, you didn't like it, you almost got a scratch off the file

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:10.700
 it weighs a lot for those who are on the tip of the tongue to thank you for your support

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:15.960
 collaboration for we make a new party to dispute the elections of Sunday 22

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:22.919
 a party of ours from brazil has this statute already has it tidy lets it go well

00:34:22.919 --> 00:34:29.970
 of course, even if the new party or alliance is sanctioned in 2022

00:34:29.970 --> 00:34:33.480
 created by brazil will not have party fund

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:37.440
 the people who are keeping an eye on the personal partisan background of the duo a page from

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.109
 my party fought over the fund

00:34:40.109 --> 00:34:45.270
 whoever uses the fund also two that the one from the fund 2 will be complicated

00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:52.919
 be accountable every 15 days and more and more social media are there

00:34:52.919 --> 00:34:58.290
 guy is a candidate in any state there right from psl nothing against the partner no longer

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:02.490
 do not want to talk about how iceland takes care of their lives is more to use the fund to

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:10.370
 doing santina is going to backfire you’re going to lose the fundão there

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:15.720
 was born was not born without anyone complaining about misery in love with the media

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:20.280
 supported even because it would not be able to have from that moment the fund

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:25.710
 and hence the public money to finance the electoral campaign does not

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:32.640
 I think this is not the case in my case, do not elect from the republic with no fund, none of the

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:39.320
 four minutes and we collected it was the result of donations via a large part of the

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:47.820
 people from the midwestern countryside mato grosso do sul goiás são paulo also the

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:55.250
 four million and used only two still left two parties the party still

00:35:55.250 --> 00:36:00.860
 generates confusion a whole part of the bottom gold party

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:05.340
 they said that what they were generating founded their apartment here when you can't

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:11.760
 compare with 8 thousand a month although it is not to make a mistake the pen does not

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:20.340
 you can see here where the bridge here the source name and the barreiro bridge are

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:25.860

 day if god wants and the contract will be signed tomorrow I will not make this is

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:12.720
 because I don’t think it’s convenient for the white stone to sign this contract

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:18.900
 the state company together will be all right congratulations to rosane is worth the mayor is that

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:24.810
 really interested in finding a solution for this bridge here in china

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:37.320
 aquino here in são vicente was worth 57 thousand reais also has the highest score

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:43.440
 also that the budget and exchange of castor beans and the golden and silver lion's den

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:49.020
 potato batatal region where else for it to beet up in Brazil all over

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:53.310
 I'm saying that I'm here on the side here of the value of the Ribeira valley and go

00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:58.140
 help a lot the local economy that the poorest region of the river was in are

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:01.710
 Paulo will release whose economy is basically banana

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:08.010
 I would very much like to discuss matters that I think the riverside deserved more

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:13.800
 a dam in the region of per year maybe in the next even to avoid the large

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:19.710
 floods that exist between 22 and 31 in the region of warri surety actor ending with

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:31.290
 the seven-bar banana from the golden record is and who knows up front in the

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:36.870
 future we can solve this matter there for the girl to minimize the

00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:42.680
 suffering that the play thought all over here on the side affirms a personal thing

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:51.510
 already in effect here the overdraft fee the overdraft fee is not

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:55.530
 no I'm a deputy I was not a deputy for what I trained with the lieutenant captain

00:38:55.530 --> 00:39:00.690
 of the army that I joined on average 13% went to 8 and seize the moment

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:09.780
 here, right, because it went from 13 to 8 that the savings bank put five then Pedro

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:12.880
 andré is to be congratulated if not for that

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:18.190
 the initiative would continue 13 14 until it increases, then the box

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:24.520
 paying customers paying there almost 500 thousand children a month

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:30.849
 and if you break it now go to the box the box is in the front but it will not

00:39:30.849 --> 00:39:36.760
 over there also thinking that I would be in debt if I said I needed 5% a month to attack

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:40.510
 utah pedro told me he is studying the

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:46.150
 see if this percentage decreases and these 5 people go to the court is 46

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:50.440
 selic does not spend four and a half is a burden because it is through this business a year

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:59.920
 a barbarity to the cashier everyone there, look at these banks or go out to the cashier

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.830
 unless the banks follow the example of the cashier the new one is not all right if

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:08.080
 otherwise pedro will kill the other helton pedro exterminator banks

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:11.410
