 military personnel also routinely already employs policemen in and policing

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.640
 so we made the proposal to allow

 it is also employment of these policemen in these preservation areas that will be useful

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:43.180
 for the environment is going to be more

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.400
 effective use of the police with the resources that the environment already has and

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.630
 finally we have many parliamentarians who are graduates of the military police

00:08:52.630 --> 00:09:00.940
 and fire brigades is in all the leaders and we got there too

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:05.650
 the possibility that these policemen can assist the legislative power in the

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:08.950
 federal district, municipal or state level

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:12.790

 when he was a deputy and present a proposal in addition to the proposals that today

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:31.510
 walked in the chamber and in the senate to guarantee with you speak rear

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:35.320
 legal protection for public security professionals is a broader project that is

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.860
 being built in partnership with the ministry of justice the ministry of

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.580
 defense that will also guarantee the military of the armed forces when

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:47.020
 employed in guaranteeing law and order and to military police officers

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.320
 federal civilian road guards municipal when you are in the exercise

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.520
 of the function that they have legal protection from the state so that they don't

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.090
 become so fragile, that is to say the policeman after serving a

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:04.360
 mission by superior determination may be the commander of the military police of the

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.780
 governor a court decision he comes home

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:13.000
 to sleep and the next day he receives a medal and not the visit of an officer of

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.640
 justice to subpoena you to answer the case so this applies in this

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.720
 our proposal that will go through the parliament chamber and federal senate

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:27.040

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:37.830
 buy the mission he will be decorated and not sue I intend even more

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:43.180
 of the bill goes through the bed has to go through the chamber by the senate

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:47.800
 okay is self-defense what is the expansion of self-defense

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:52.870
 in this defense then you you armed citizen a cool obviously energy

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:56.510
 defense of your life from others of your heritage

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:01.070
 the third of your property the third you can shoot

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:05.390
 it doesn't matter what constitution is going to give and you enter then not excluding

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.910
 illegality you answer but there is no punishment

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:10.820
 it happens to develop for example united states

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:16.640
 nobody wants to invent anything here is our way of reacting and fighting

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:21.800
 the violence in our brazil the good citizen cannot continue is

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.310
 how many want here in Brazil to be a lamb

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:29.960
 in this sea of ​​wolves that we have ahead it is done president was very well

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.140
 received and this is an agenda that unites all security professionals

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:39.590
 be federal military civilian and quasi-municipal military police officers

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:44.330
 of the armed forces and a proposal that they have long longed for this

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:51.590
 expansion of this legal guarantee many feel there is simply that

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:55.220
 the state turns its back on cowardice many times that the state does with young people

00:11:55.220 --> 00:12:01.130
 police and military personnel are placed in a confrontational situation and when in some

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:07.370
 moment is there is something that gets out of control because there is obviously mostly

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:12.620
 of cases the intention of the police and make the cerrado of yours but this happens a

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:15.530
 real situation they are completely helpless

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.680
 sometimes money is spent colleagues have to materialize to get

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:22.970
 lawyers all so in the matter of truth a defense

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:26.960
 we have already forwarded through that first suggestion from the ministry of

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:32.210
 justice the minister live at the congress a relaxation a new reading of the

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:36.080
 concept of self-defense but so far doing something broader and

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:40.040
 aimed at public security and military professionals from the

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:45.590
 armed with exercise of the function today in caracas begins the forum meeting

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:49.610
 from são paulo these people never give up

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:54.830
 they want to steal much more than our assets want to steal our freedom and

00:12:54.830 --> 00:13:02.000
 make it very clear it was only paulo born in 1990 the pt was there with the farc forces

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.200
 Colombian revolutionary armed forces are the worst in the world

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:12.690
 was already in 90 and now they are meeting again in caracas looking for ways

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:19.980
 to become victimized and come back, you know, to get back to politics stronger, you obviously

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:25.740
 what quality in all this and asking God and doing our part is that Brazil doesn’t

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:31.770
 become a venezuela so it was from são paulo enough to enjoy

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:37.550
 that about obliged to advertise here the first lady michelle and michelle

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:45.180
 that was in the cell because she has rightly complained there is a lot of fake

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.570
 not even using her name as i live too this one was in the first lady

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:57.780
 there were 174 thousand subscribers here who can register her work

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:03.330
 basically aimed at people with disabilities in brazil is because my

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:09.030
 wife was not a wonderful job even before she was first lady so

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:14.120
 congratulations to michelle emotional and who were able to sign up here

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:19.350
 logically if it doesn't grow enough i'll have a reward today it's up to

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:24.990
 who knows today is improved is not thinking about the afternoon today is improved

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:29.340
 sidnei that the major I am the major captain who was in the

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.060
 active i will do

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:38.000
 (Laughter) I know there was a young woman who saw the lack of

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:46.310
 30 favor instagram michelle with two of them bolsonaro and thanks guys

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:49.370
 ahead here right I don't earn 6 thousand a month as

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:53.300
 that presenter who has already moved to 600 is right but everything I think I’m

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.420
 giving the message here the correction of hackers today

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:02.480
 obviously we have information keep me informed via my wall ministry

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:10.010
 and who gives the information first hand and I just after disclosing that what

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:15.050
 I say my phone was there in the group in this group of these four racks

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:21.190
 today there are days when you integrated that when you saw back

00:15:21.529 --> 00:15:28.040
 and obviously Brazil with law, these people confirm everything that happened

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:32.000
 here has to be held responsible on my part I have no

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.860
 concern about invasion on my phone that the information what I have

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:41.510
 Tocantins' treaty being strategically reserved for Brazil

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:46.160
 we talked personally here not only with the minister the authorities even from

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.850
 outside of brazil so we have no problem when it comes to

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:58.870
 this because I think that even the angel of the election week I have been

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:03.620
 snooped on by someone from inside and outside of brazil would be childish to

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:08.920
 our part but if anyone has a particular thing it was bypassed public

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:17.180
 regrets there is a crime the invasion of phones and certainly the justice

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:25.279
 Brazilian will give a good position for this for these people is yesterday

00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:30.649
 we did the provisional measure the release of part of the fgts I will not

00:16:30.649 --> 00:16:33.440
 go into detail a lot of people complained about socceroos de

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.319
 arrifana it makes clear the conditions for

00:16:37.319 --> 00:16:44.069
 withdrawals from the fgts are 15 currently 15 unfair dismissal retirement

00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:48.359
 death aged 70 years or over

00:16:48.359 --> 00:16:54.869
 the question of the cause of home ownership we put in the 16th and that it is optional to complain

00:16:54.869 --> 00:16:58.679
 who is complaining is just stay at yours stay at home quietly no problem

00:16:58.679 --> 00:17:07.220
 now there are a lot but a lot of people that 500 reais is missing even from the spc list

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:12.689
 among others there who is an account holder of the savings bank

00:17:12.689 --> 00:17:16.110
 the money will be credited automatically only if he wants to

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:19.289
 return and return does not make use without any problem

00:17:19.289 --> 00:17:23.370
 we aim to reach exactly the poorest, right

00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:31.230
 around 80 percent of those who have a fgts account for you 80% have 500

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:37.159
 have less already know how much will help I remember the time of lieutenant captain

00:17:37.159 --> 00:17:43.590
 any without there being another 200, you know, that came in one way from another it was mine

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:47.100
 in the domestic budget was very welcome as a captain in the army imagine

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:55.460
 who has a salary is less than the theme of inconsistency in his professional life

00:17:55.610 --> 00:18:05.119
 well result of the last the best result of unemployed in the last

00:18:05.119 --> 00:18:09.899
 five years we hit with access and eight thousand new

00:18:09.899 --> 00:18:14.190
 jobs excluding those who lose the job that started with 68 thousand more

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:18.869
 jobs in the economy will react to critical hunger is often what had to

00:18:18.869 --> 00:18:21.899
 michel government fear he made a reform of the clt

00:18:21.899 --> 00:18:25.769
 I made it clear a proposal was ready and I voted in favor, make it very clear

00:18:25.769 --> 00:18:30.480
 there if they had not been approved back there with certainty today maybe not

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:37.409
 we had a recovery of the small 408 thousand new jobs is more

00:18:37.409 --> 00:18:41.419
 recovery would be much less

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:46.379
 evidence that for some it is chemotherapy so I would like it not

00:18:46.379 --> 00:18:52.529
 if the reform was done more squid tried latoy dilma tried michel

00:18:52.529 --> 00:18:56.269
 fear also tried and failed it really is not easy has a lot of reaction

00:18:56.269 --> 00:19:00.120
 but passed a wide margin of voting in the chamber

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:05.039
 all right and this is a signal for investors from outside and inside that the

00:19:05.039 --> 00:19:10.950
 Brazil is concerned with doing homework, we are spending a lot more

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:15.389
 of what we collected I now had with the governor of the amazonas took measures

00:19:15.389 --> 00:19:20.580
 also drastic with regard to the state public servant and he said the same

00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:25.019
 thing if you don't do that the state breaks and we have been in brazil in a situation

00:19:25.019 --> 00:19:29.909
 quite complicated with my money is complicated yet goiás has

00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:34.320
 talked to caiado ok rio grande do sul also have problems among others

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:39.899
 states this leaf grew too much the number of servers

00:19:39.899 --> 00:19:44.879
 there came a point that states are also very much spending a lot more

00:19:44.879 --> 00:19:50.159
 with the public servant, right between active and inactive people, which allows

00:19:50.159 --> 00:19:54.269
 tax liability law and something has to be done if you do anything

00:19:54.269 --> 00:19:59.940
 breaks breaks everything and ours is ours our reform did not reach the poor

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:07.200
 okay it doesn’t reach the poor so they can rest assured that we’ll

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:12.840
 obliged to do and Brazil will not understand it will take off in the economy is is the

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.980
 from next year if god wanted it is already showing signs of recovery

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:21.210
 since now on tuesday we also launched the new gas market

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:28.559
 the simple announcement of this has already fallen is the price of gas at the source and you know that

00:20:28.559 --> 00:20:33.210
 many people do not reach the end of the line but with the breaking of the monopoly it is in the

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:40.529
 Regarding distribution and transport, the trend is for the price to fall in the medium term

00:20:40.529 --> 00:20:43.259
 we hope it works out we are sure it will work out here

00:20:43.259 --> 00:20:49.210
 the change in the national drug count before drugs

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:54.220
 continuation of drugs only that some criticizing I had there

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:58.090
 I'm not sure here the 80 90 people on that board

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:03.940
 reduced to approximately 20 I would ask you right pt would need

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:09.820
 really to have here at the conad representative of the une to talk about the

00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:14.500
 anti-drug policy the joke by someone from the UN drug policy a joke

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:23.200
 it was not we know that their position is also the representative of the artistic milieu

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:30.610
 we also cut the Czech half also in a complicated fashion that a board

00:21:30.610 --> 00:21:36.210
 smaller more leaner more select we are able to discuss a good policy

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:42.220
 drugs that are really good for all of us Brazilians here and when

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:50.409
 speak in artistic media make it very clear and last week I stayed the film

00:21:50.409 --> 00:21:54.850
 bruna surfistinha made with public money and which has already been spent

00:21:54.850 --> 00:22:00.940
 money is done the pot we have no way to go back for everything it seems

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:06.370
 that there but today it was announced look how all the ancine works right

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:11.260
 a release of 530 thousand will make a film with me look at the guys or cool

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:15.490
 nice I don't have this could all about the sine sine

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:22.409
 we have positions that are is elective don't have a date I can't take one of

00:22:22.409 --> 00:22:27.490
 directly interfere in if it makes it very clear who Brazil wants to do

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:32.350
 movie bruna surfistinha whoever is at ease

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:36.610
 this if interference forces no censorship what we cannot

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:43.179
 admit we don't want is that kind of film or political film of mine with that

00:22:43.179 --> 00:22:46.960
 a person who maybe even well-intentioned who was because it was doing it

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:51.100
 with diana for it was conceived it has nothing we can’t agree with but then it’s okay

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.250
 of course the decree has already transferred

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:58.780
 josé jance do rio to brasília will stay here brasília here i will stay

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:03.400
 I look at the people and even more after this announcement here and make a film with

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:08.950
 public money my person ancine won another positive fo is

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:13.960
 positive observed fact we will seek the extinction of ancine

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:20.620
 there’s nothing that the public authorities don’t have to do to make films that have a

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:24.070
 film company that privately without any problem

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:28.960
 but the state will stop sponsoring this one after all I can't talk

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:32.650
 names of many sponsored films here because they bid in the past

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:37.630
 I can't talk because there is a child watching this live of ours can stay

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:44.590
 at ease I will not speak are not being resolved there is no film with the scholarship

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:48.970
 not even wearing jair bolsonaro claimed public money is for that we are not going

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:55.020
 continue here the gas market this week to analyze the conare here

00:23:55.020 --> 00:24:01.510
 national refugee commission is that the national refugee council is

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:04.780
 right she is subordinate to at least justice

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:11.280
 sergio moura and we hunt the stage to swim for three terrorists

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:16.120
 Paraguay wonders when this refugee status was granted and

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:22.000
 when he kicks and when 2003 wants president squid it couldn't be another right

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.540
 here you are making a haven of crooks of corrupt and terrorists is an example

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:34.690
 de cesare battisti is already enjoying a perpetual holiday in italy is in a good

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:40.090
 baptized lady there until when we have now in holy faith

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:45.160
 i saved the president of bolivia some were scared is healthy and was with

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:51.940
 I miss him and I complimented him at this point it’s physically that he when

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:57.910
 cesare battisti was arrested in bolivia he is at all for italy this

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:06.040
 terrorist responsible for four executions and he will definitely have a

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:10.510
 life in the next 90 or 100 years then the

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:15.580
 Brazil ceases to be a haven for bandits dressed as refugees

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:23.049
 politicians here as long as you know the truckers today would go with me to

00:25:23.049 --> 00:25:27.970
 manaus our mister ciro has a lot to talk about but he keeps working at

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:32.289
 cohesion of truck drivers in brazil we brothers who deserve respect and

00:25:32.289 --> 00:25:37.630
 consideration we know their importance and a

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:42.970
 possible strike was stopped but continues to work to serve them for example

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:46.750
 we revoke the new freight table is valid previous

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:53.500
 other measures for them a project our regret in the chamber increasing the validity of

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:59.230
 driver's license from 5 to 10 years is a good measure didn’t weigh well he not only

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:05.289
 in relation to the driver's license, increasing traffic is a high cost, right?

00:26:05.289 --> 00:26:09.010
 for the truck driver for all drivers anyway but it weighs a lot the

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:13.990
 worker is also a toxicology exam ending it which is a cost

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:19.419
 very high is very much in the pocket of the worker in the day-to-day years that were

00:26:19.419 --> 00:26:21.580
 made with very little periodicity

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:27.100
 is that it had a very strong impact and is lit did an excellent job of

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:31.990
 to check within the traffic code everything that was possible to expand in terms

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:39.039
 of legislation to give less weight is the load that is heavier than the car that the

00:26:39.039 --> 00:26:43.929
 workers only load truckers from 20 to 40 point

00:26:43.929 --> 00:26:48.490
 to ask for the situation card increasing there the ballast of points accumulated during

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:52.929
 the period for 40 points this for those who are professional drivers and

00:26:52.929 --> 00:26:59.470
 travel 2 to 12 hours a day is very common to happen

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:04.809
 unfortunately and ends up penalizing by taking the breadwinner out of the worker

00:27:04.809 --> 00:27:08.830
 humble at the tip of the tongue is not losing your driver's license and losing your

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:12.039
 work card like that so who stays is all the time you

00:27:12.039 --> 00:27:17.260
 already made a trip I can say that I already did in rio-santos speed bumps around

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:22.330
 40 kilometers per hour I promised if I’m doing my best to

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:28.720
 end the fine to the manager, but the lawsuit saw there the holy spirit with the

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:33.279
 justice who wants justice wants to keep the radar we're not negotiating maybe it's

00:27:33.279 --> 00:27:37.480
 pass it to me or reduce it to a thousand making it possible to put where

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:43.029
 exactly must be placed on being signaled each registration by chance was

00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:49.179
 thousand really we go to the countless you are there for example on br 163 a radar has

00:27:49.179 --> 00:27:54.340
 one side 1,200 cannot the student 200 january in the south only a thousand in brazil

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:58.720
 for me there would be nothing we are working on awaiting a response from

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:03.669
 wall ministry and is doing a study i also want to put an end to the

00:28:03.669 --> 00:28:06.360
 mobile radars

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:12.610
 the resolution is is a mystery is reviewing this procedure is a determination of the

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:18.039
 president and also to realize that the inspection she was hidden from

00:28:18.039 --> 00:28:23.080
 union did not fulfill the educational effect it was just a fundraising purpose

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:28.450
 the fines are high stacy is also being very zealous says

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:31.510
 direct the installation of electronic inspection equipment

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:37.149
 in a judicious technical manner where there is actually a risk of accident but of

00:28:37.149 --> 00:28:40.840
 signaled way so that it fulfills the educational effect not only the collective

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:47.919
 we also put an end to it because a resolution of the simulator

00:28:47.919 --> 00:28:55.419
 I hope the camera does not vote now the law is mandatory in the simulator has a lot

00:28:55.419 --> 00:29:00.399
 spurious interest, I called it clear, okay, I hope, of course, I have

00:29:00.399 --> 00:29:05.620
 conviction that the chamber will not do this but without people there already wanting it is

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:10.059
 completely misrepresent this project of ours that aims to serve all the

00:29:10.059 --> 00:29:15.220
 engines from brazil and also in a special part the truck drivers drivers of

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:22.299
 bus and uberaba taxi couch is right in the correction of the 40 afonso and a

00:29:22.299 --> 00:29:26.770
 bigger thing take a hit me on my project I'm

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:31.840
 putting it there and there is no car seat in the car to transport the child, right

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:39.850
 he’s just a three point penalty in the wallet and he also criticizes saying that I

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:46.180
 I made it easier for him to release the chairs in the code, there was a fine and

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:49.810
 points in the car seat in the code quite the opposite this actually was

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:53.770
 misinterpreted the information, the car seat didn’t have a

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:59.230
 prediction in the legislation if I actually brought the prediction into law taking the

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:04.990
 lipor is the solution foresees it was monetary punishment is your salida of the fine of

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:09.730
 payment of the fine but the requirement of the car seat is not had stuck in god or

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:13.510
 I brought this, legislation with a lot of responsibility

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:19.990
 is one is an important instrument for protecting lives but as I said so

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:24.100
 the ministry is being very without light really in verifying in the code of

00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:27.610
 transit that what can facilitate has only present idea the average price for the

00:30:27.610 --> 00:30:33.400
 obtaining a cnh with the current rules of two thousand reais 2 thousand reais is very

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:38.200
 money for most of the Brazilian population and sometimes the car is mine

00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:42.790
 first month of work today person can work an app like 3d

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:46.300
 application can start doing some kind of service

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:50.590
 imagine a young man starting to get two thousand reais from where he is going to get this

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:55.990
 money then the simulators and everything made it very expensive to grant this

00:30:55.990 --> 00:31:00.070
 driver's license the simulator plus or minus 300 reais a

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:03.640
 less in the wallet and more still you are obliged

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:09.450
 when you were doing the health exam there is a clinic with the DMV

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:15.490
 in the project our approved case you can think of the football that the father of

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:20.230
 your child with the neighboring army central hospital at any doctor putting

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:24.160
 was that could we hope that all certainty that the

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:27.340
 camera not in a mechanism quite the opposite, you know?

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:32.370
 test our project and even include more than 15 13 people in bed

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:39.930
 so in the Senate has a head to suggest more measures so that so

00:31:39.930 --> 00:31:45.870
 which is it is cheaper to leave I am even more I would be favorable I learned to

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:49.920
 drive on the ten-storey farm to drive a tractor there on the São Paulo side

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:54.300
 doing it here doesn’t enjoy it I think even more right I think not even

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:59.400
 I had exam time of nothing is a written part only that will practice has not

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:03.809
 going to school to do a lot there is something you already know what's going to happen

00:32:03.809 --> 00:32:09.179
 then the practical test and a test is literary writing that would not be the

00:32:09.179 --> 00:32:11.929
