 and my election happened as I am here in the middle of the gospel

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.060
 I want to make it very clear that there is no possibility on the part of the federal government

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.290
 if a new tax is created as recently announced by the media

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.189
 that we would be creating the new church tax

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.280
 it does not exist says if one day we see talking

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.939

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:33.049
 the evangelical segment as Catholic or will be remembered at this time

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.079

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.270
 provisional that the treated economic freedom came

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.590
 this was done so last Tuesday there are two boys who use will

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.580
 talk about what is the provisional measure of economic freedom that interests the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.020
 Brazil is not only economical yet difficult, we find it, but God willing

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.980

 job across the stream besides ready so we are working

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.020
 for the election of the national president we believe it is the way that

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.270
 opening up the economy by making entrepreneurs have more is the will to

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.100
 investing in brazil having confidence is opening more companies generating more

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.830
 job is that we’re going to take brazil out of the deep end that put us

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.450
 I thank the official president for this wonderful work and the courage to do

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.070
 this provisional measure and now the thing goes from the congress so you should lose

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.300
 it can still improve to leave the Brazilian entrepreneur who is one of the

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.700
 the best entrepreneurs in the world that I know and the entrepreneur who has the strength to

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:29.090
 will is creative so that we can make brazil one of the biggest on the streets

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.550
 from gold to well president for this great são paulo

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.440
 step in creation using the military college knot of brazil

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.740
 there in the mars field in são paulo almost 5 hectares

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.780
 we will do with the help of the local businessmen that the army would have no more

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.050
 making the building we will turn the day of our light of the current legislation

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.240
 teachers, a large part of the military is then aware that this military college works

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.570
 in the heart são paulo senac santa catarina

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:09.060
 preferably in the capital we are coast in almeirim on the ground we can

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.290
 start negotiations to also do a school here in santa catarina

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.489
 military and I'm sure that the construction which is a support by the

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.520
 businessman trained in the car because only education did we take brazil out of axn

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.030
 while 2014 what takes a man and a woman but the difficult thing is knowledge is

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.970
 what we want for Brazil dear already looking at venezuela is still

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:42.000
 a problem for brazil i quickly ask for the subtle of venezuela and

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.990
 with your comment i want to talk about that with the consequences for brazil that

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.220
 matter they really wanted me to and I also talked about the system problem in

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.630
 argentina now we have to join hands so that the almost neighboring south of

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:01.500
 you to this wonderful country that cannot suffer a setback from león

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.400
 despite the movement and nine in venezuela this week

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:12.200
 we still consider the intelligent undefined situation that qualified the

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.440
 that there was a defeat by the president of ibope

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.500
 we don’t see it that way here it’s not easy to get out of power

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:31.310
 to someone that he and I know legitimacy decided to entice his generals

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.280
 surprisingly around 2000 and entice in a way

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.050
 totally unexpected totally nonstandard

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:47.620
 those who should be the ones who most defended the country live stressing the

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.139
 patriotism the dignity of venezuela and what happens is that these generals who

00:05:53.139 --> 00:06:00.370
 they were enticed and bought by carlos who give them a much higher salary and

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:07.389
 that are influential in the economy so the economy for example that of oil that

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:13.509
 is the great source of venezuela and has reduced venezuela's production to 840

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:19.780
 thousand barrels daily and it is significant or loss for the country and moreover employed

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:26.650
 many generals in drug trafficking so this is terrible so what if this

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:32.560
 leader the mature man it is not easy to take power off the radio pressures

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:39.099
 international organizations can gradually show the staff of the civilian population

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:44.080
 who has not yet understood the seriousness of the problem and mainly showing

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:48.729
 high-ranking military men that they need to have a patriotism

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:54.159
 to turn to bring venezuela back to the path of freedom and

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:58.719
 democracy we will continue to fight the meeting of

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:04.090
 file that will happen in a little while will reinforce this work and we are

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:09.940
 hoping that Venezuela will be able to get rid of this situation

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:16.300
 extremely unpleasant that leads the people to malnutrition the lack do not forget

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.490
 of health with an inflation of 1 million per year which no one can understand

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:26.230
 so we use them that and civility are convinced

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:32.740
 are destroying their children's future was born out of a fissure in the army

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:39.010
 of venezuela in the lowest ranks but in view of this absurdity to rise and

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:44.020
 hit other general bumps and the solution goes through our money and

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:50.740
 we will do everything possible within our limits so that venezuela comes back

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.340
 normality makes it clear that this also happens

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:59.800
 venezuela has an impact on our economy because if the oil supply falls in the

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.980
 international market the tendency is to increase the price and the price increase

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:07.120
 we have consequences here in the price of fuels in Brazil but I think it is

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.920
 important to talk about the oil text

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:13.780
 people think that in some prime gas hours this year already ho

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:21.790
 oil international oil price rose from $ 50 to $ 72 the dollar

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:26.140
 it also went up because of the pension plan that we have to approve

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:29.290
 so the following we cannot become an argentine

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:34.660
 we have to pass the social security is international oil price needs

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:39.790
 go back so that prices fall again it is not you who are to blame for the increase

00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:44.950
 weight over 300 simple people know this to happen some sense

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:50.800
 no one here is going to be getting involved in issues outside the country but I like

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:57.280
 citizen everyone here as a citizen I am concerned that the government will come back

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:04.150
 of the monkey the president of the pt the president of the previous right held with

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:10.600
 dilma a street is mature and Chávez cuba if it comes back

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:15.220
 certainly in argentina will study a situation will enter

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:21.040
 similar in venezuela we talk about this you guys have a lot is the biggest campaign if

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.140
 must lose here we will analyze it is total and i hope our brothers

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:30.190
 Argentines get conscious if they are aware days

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:34.360
 if marketing is not going well patience will even struggle to improve or

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.360
 someone in his line now that he can't go back

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:42.550
 cristina cristina also understand the reflexes will be to speak the point of the duck

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:47.050
 yes we can with the return of the pool kit possible vote I pray to god that no

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:51.610
 nothing happens to see our dear argentina will be formalized and not

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:56.320
 we want it let's go to the closing now so there is an event here

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:01.240
 here on the reef with great religions is the last issue with fifa want a

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:06.279
 financial activity control board to work so that he

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:11.589
 go to the ministry of economics where it depends on us it is the ministry of

00:10:11.589 --> 00:10:17.529
 justice and security because it is a tool in the hand of this ministry to

00:10:17.529 --> 00:10:23.350
 combat money laundering and fight corruption, that something was missing

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:28.120
 accuses me of having released 200 and a few million reais for venice is not

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.060
 true the release of resources via measure

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:35.920
 provisional order asking parliament was to meet demand from the army

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:40.990
 Brazilian in the well-known operation, this operation receives the

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:48.970
 refugees in venezuela did not have treatment for them in the vaccine instruction in

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:53.650
 all things and then she’s crazy in the rest of Brazil because I advise you

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:58.250
 I am fleeing the dictatorship I am fleeing the form of violence and today

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:03.980
 present on the map with these things happening this week there was a

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:09.200
 significant increase that migration soared to 600 people a day but the

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:14.000
 Vasco had 600 and 800 people are being welcomed with the same dignity

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.370
 with the same effort that has been made but the biggest expense and there are problems in

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:25.340
 good view of the recess of people who have to be naturally housed and then

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:29.660
 transfer the frontera place flies by the rulers pity that problems in us

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:34.610
 hospitals are all crowded as high for the month the son dematricular coast

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:40.430
 if we don't do that it becomes chaos already has a serious problem but more molecule

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:45.620
 it would turn chaos and the governor of nothing always in contact with us in which he seeks

00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:49.130
 through his guidance also seek a solution for this case

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:53.600
 so this is what i want to thank for every opportunity Thursday
