00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
good night folks I confess that I was missing it will not be the one I

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.230
 wanted to have some restrictions yet but we have good news to give

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.210
 above all true news here on my left they act on our

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:27.240
 internal of pounds here a novelty that the strong focus of goiás and he is the director

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.830
 of biofuel from the Ministry of Mines and Energy because of bill possible with

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.329
 once at the united states house we were accused he was the one who saw it right

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.890
 the press outside and inside Brazil I am responsible for the fire in Brazil

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.680
 tony all right with a little noise there because the rule of the game is in the media

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:59.489
 start heating up residence time one two three four five

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.150
 six seven stories seven stories against me can without a cinema with the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.250
 accusation of corruption of the technical ministry every day with good

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.850
 news of them gets 77 negative stories with me and the most

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.799
 important was dad are 10 pages that my hour is

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.820
 from the time he went through gay and 35 sessions with a psychologist to see if he could

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.700
 a future for someone later to sue against the guidance of the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.310
 federal board of psychology would most certainly do would be prosecuted now

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.979
 even though I acted in careless poetic disagreement as well

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.740
 the bid is ethical for a large part of Brazilian life is asking too much is now also

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.920
 details that the magazine is you looking for here

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.280
 has no official government propaganda page

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.840
 on a page of the official propaganda of the river if I had determined here a

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.590
 state official bank announces a page two says that the courier delivers the letter

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.690
 presents to know with him to know that occurring in casa brasil that doesn’t have

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.850
 thing that the plan has as ethics but if it were current it wouldn’t have a subject

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.360
 against people quite the opposite, even promoting my time to raise money

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.900
 more clients to attend there was his psychology degree

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:44.310
 let's talk a little about miguel rosa which is very important

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.840
 coincidentally today it is heavy what is better today 40 years ago that the program

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.780
 of alcohol-powered car works in Brazil 40 years 40 of its name of September

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.870
 40 years anniversary its product programs produced in ethanol in the car

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:08.010
 it started in the government if the gazin you take the works of the military government

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.620
 there is little left over brazil or what they did in others is just for

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.670
 little in Brazil and again this type of alcohol engine is to appear in the

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.110
 at that time as a function and some problem I had as a ballet was not a crisis of the

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.850
 oil the second time the catholic is lacking oil that makes the price much more

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.480
 price of fuel in Brazil because the weight of the gasoline power I was there

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.840
 underneath it would be a show together here I don't know who it is

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.560
 more or less and maybe then the one below is the book as a logical day maybe I don't know

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.150
 semester that is the part that weighs the most in the taxpayer’s pocket

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.750
 is an average state tax of 30 for example

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.090
 so the federal government invested ethanol here in the album exactly decreases the

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.220
 dependence on importing from brazil was in this

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.940
 time I was already investing a lot in work I was already investing a lot

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.720
 but it is a little far from self-reliance

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:16.950
 but it’s something that we’re going to see for a week next week is for new york in

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.730
 a year the UN to make a statement there is in the face that you charge is because the

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.680
 most countries attack me in a very violent way is that I am

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.510
 responsible for the fires there in Brazil we know that there are data

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.960
 officials is that whoever rules has inflation every year unfortunately, which even has a

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.780
 a matter of tradition I'm not a caboclo but he set fire to last year he planted a

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.760
 thing tocantins the indian does the same thing

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.620
 there are those who speak in a criminal way also now how to fight it all without

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.450
 means, right, one in the Amazon region that catches if not

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.340
 I'm mistaken I think it should be helping the gum station that way that there is a

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:13.970
 percentage is hard to leave I don't do it now we do our best because

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.020
 some countries in europe hit us hard what they wanted when i

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:25.260
 come back from this big difference as I was unlucky in osaka time on the street

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:31.680
 for me to come home, mark two dozen more 60 indigenous people with 30 more

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.560
 or 40 quilombolas to expand environmental parks if I decide tomorrow

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:44.310
 negative to everyone there like here all over the planet with part of the new but rather in

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:50.820
 of craft to mark and 20 indigenous reserves that 50 quilombola the fire

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.979
 ends immediately in the Amazon region and that some countries aside the note was

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:01.880
 doing with this story of money from the fund

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.790
 amazon are buying our amazon

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:11.270
 is the Indian what does he want life similar to us once having a

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:17.630
 access there contact with the new he wants a dentist loaded in the top on

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:23.180
 mouth the doctor to find out something he wants electricity when

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.710
 with this internet it’s amazing, right? We’ve been amazed for a short time

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:34.490
 when we met he wants to and that is what we want yes we do have some fans of

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.120
 government wants to keep them primitively as if they were men

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.580
 prehistoric want to get married in the future of this school and that the guys who is from

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.660
 I look at the wealth that is under the ground, so

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.640
 say something to us here my favor is to be leased here now is the

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.840
 press announced to participate tomorrow has no less good news does not have my name

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:02.510
 but toyota is installing sorocaba in são paulo because it wants toyota is

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:08.120
 investing will invest 1 billion reais to put a toyota plant in

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.570
 sorocaba são paulo what i'm seeing is releasing an hour

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.770
 government policy is to launch new energy transition policy

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:18.890
 energy efficiency valuing the use of ethanol

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.640
 this made toyota create an ethanol hybrid car

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.830
 the first car in the world that will generate will work from

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:33.169
 ethanol and it's the president way we generate the ethanol powered electric car and

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:36.800
 instead of plugging in the house socket you will put the channel it will take the

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.479
 hydrogen and making the electric car work in brazil can be around

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:46.550
 of this great technology to revolutionize Brazil and this government is doing this

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:51.620
 structure what we go with the program will remunerate the withdrawal of each

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:58.280
 one paying a disability without subsidy without paying meetings in just creating the

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:03.700
 legal mechanisms for carbon offsetting and that means

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:08.570
 700 million tons of cargo or removed from the atmosphere with brazil is a

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:14.810
 world problem equals 5 million trees planted is more water than

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:20.630
 have denmark holland belgium holland and united kingdom next to the planted streets is

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:25.010
 what we are doing today to create income jobs and a new

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:29.479
 opportunity and the lowest the bill is the next paid to the producer who does not

00:08:29.479 --> 00:08:34.849
 deforest even if he can legally deforest so he otta to win the

00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:40.099
 carbon credit to trade carbon credits to preserve and

00:08:40.099 --> 00:08:45.020
 more president the price of fuel in Brazil is low as it was because

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:49.459
 the more efficient the price with me as the smaller size biofuel

00:08:49.459 --> 00:08:54.080
 more consumer option to use he can put the channel or with little

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.459
 gasoline is the same thing with brilliance

00:08:57.459 --> 00:09:01.520
 excellent news only that brazil was in the lap of

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:07.280
 environmental issue and the Apaches do their part, we suffer is that Brazil is a

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:13.490
 power and you have to do your part

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:18.430
 I'm sad for the Brazilians attacking me for burning in the Amazon

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:24.560
 when if they never had it and it would never cease to exist and what is

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:30.470
 if it’s ok it’s part of the average of the last 15 years but the staff goes to

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:37.790
 first back there and after accused nero also setting fire to everything around me

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:42.260
 am to get closer if what was predicted at that time the countries of

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:47.120
 outside brazil scheduled for august is in brazil until sunday 22 is that the future

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:54.080
 whoever was to elect president in 2018 demarcated approximately 400 more

00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:00.020
 new indigenous reserves and approximately 900 quilombolas in addition to

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:05.380
 expansion of national parks

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:10.979
 such only today’s indigenous reserve we have an area equivalent to the region

00:10:10.979 --> 00:10:16.079
 southeast is because the state of minas são paulo rio Espírito santo

00:10:16.079 --> 00:10:21.209
 with this increase of 6% we will have another area of ​​approximately right

00:10:21.209 --> 00:10:24.989
 south paraná santa catarina region and in the south

00:10:24.989 --> 00:10:30.179
 imagine our brazil with the equivalent sea is a little bit below the

00:10:30.179 --> 00:10:34.199
 southeast and south demarcated as indigenous land all

00:10:34.199 --> 00:10:40.079
 would be unviable in Brazil if agribusiness man from the countryside

00:10:40.079 --> 00:10:44.970
 already the man of the country you have to invent what to make disappeared delivered to the

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:51.439
 land to abandon it and take care of your life I don’t know how it is like that the trend is the

00:10:51.439 --> 00:11:00.029
 suffocation of our agriculture here in Brazil we occupy approximately 7%

00:11:00.029 --> 00:11:05.849
 of our territory for agriculture and other countries in europe the mere club

00:11:05.849 --> 00:11:12.119
 a lot takes up the next 70% and now our huge productivity

00:11:12.119 --> 00:11:17.879
 it is a work that has to be recognized since 9 now brings the

00:11:17.879 --> 00:11:21.689
 such Brazil who will attack Brazil as it attacks right

00:11:21.689 --> 00:11:27.809
 speaking of the zucchini button not only a minority but the improvement it represents

00:11:27.809 --> 00:11:30.869
 a lot of things attack violently and don't know the

00:11:30.869 --> 00:11:36.239
 that is happening and regrets that I'm certainly not putting Brazil to work

00:11:36.239 --> 00:11:39.720
 low if god wants me to be in new york at

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:45.059
 next tuesday i'm preparing a speech one

00:11:45.059 --> 00:11:51.239
 quite different goal from other presidents who preceded me no one

00:11:51.239 --> 00:11:54.299
 will fight with anyone there you can rest assured I will be beaten by the media any

00:11:54.299 --> 00:11:58.619
 way this life always has something to complain about right

00:11:58.619 --> 00:12:05.530
 but I'm going to talk about how Brazil is they have true number 5 notes

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:11.170
 that interests wears out the image of brazil spending because to see if you create a

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:17.530
 chaos here for those who are in good health and outside our culture too, falling is good

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:22.990
 for the country they live in says others who live on it ends up selling more against

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:27.190
 sure more expensive us here that got tired quite complicated

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:33.970
 so i believe in brazil this idol are liars if some fires are

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:39.700
 criminals feel good I have the image you must have seen is a team that is

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:47.920
 doing would be doing would be doing a clip right for a cultural event

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.640
 largo de janeiro so fashion is burning fire in part of the forest

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:57.370
 Amazon was enough I don’t know if the political police ranger

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:02.770
 the environmental police firefighters and and starts talking to the guy is the guy saying

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:08.800
 that was on Thursday for a clip a big event nec until then there will be an end

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:15.070
 of the month now barra da tijuca inside this is brazil people using lies

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:22.600
 to attack your own country it is unfortunate to say I think we have

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.450
 a program to save the world from global warming

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:31.690
 all the same soybean plant farmer is removing canongate ours is if

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:35.860
 people from other countries bought an aspect paid the price of the continuous Brazil

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.080
 will fall and this government that launched this program

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.640
 will handle this problem that will be the biggest problem of decarbonization of the

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:48.760
 world to win I will say that I have some money to comment on something

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:55.480
 fast here rates it again right 15 went to 5 and 6 percent has never been

00:13:55.480 --> 00:14:00.970
 so low every -1% to be every -1% partnership that

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:05.589
 equals more - is the approximate number between 40 and 50

00:14:05.589 --> 00:14:11.079
 billion reais less the next good news and why

00:14:11.079 --> 00:14:15.639
 that the Selic rate is re-establishing its confidence

00:14:15.639 --> 00:14:21.930
 this is what is happening brazil is doing its homework

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:28.660
 online sales grew 41% in the week in brazil which is the so-called skating base

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:35.139
 here the Fabio will play who hit the business ministers

00:14:35.139 --> 00:14:42.329
 a lot of people entered this Tuesday thrill and online shopping grew by percentage 1

00:14:42.329 --> 00:14:48.490
 41% and trade as a whole and sold 12% over the same period of the year

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:52.930
 passed the sanction of the bill that now

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:57.759
 elected from the possession of a weapon for rural landowners although

00:14:57.759 --> 00:15:02.290
 on the farm he works all the time is when we talk about goiana in the first

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:07.690
 idea its south matogrossense in mato grosso we win respect of

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:12.730
 agribusiness the man from the field was then allowed to fossil to settle the

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:20.589
 biggest loss inside his house is up to him has a big farm 2 3

00:15:20.589 --> 00:15:26.920
 thousand and 500 hectares I couldn't from now on we

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:34.380
 we put the decree on it and confirmed eln and had the support of the chamber rodrigo maia

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:42.610
 it was very helpful in this one in this question and it was by a score quite

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:47.829
 elastic gait approval extends so you're in the car you didn't have

00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:52.899
 firearm possession just buying a bet from you will not have any difficulty

00:15:52.899 --> 00:15:59.380
 to buy if you have a call for people who will see if you have someone who

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:03.970
 is hindering the purchase of this weapon is it going to take the steps that everyone

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:10.779
 the men who are charged with collaborating with the documentation and dispatching

00:16:10.779 --> 00:16:12.709
 people buying water have to follow the

00:16:12.709 --> 00:16:19.929
 law the decree decree it will then be able to mount the horse boot 1 to 3 81

00:16:19.929 --> 00:16:26.299
 transit then a cat 22 links from the lining and can ride a horse on the farm
