00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:47.560
 extra December for the Northeast region and also the issue of internet use in the

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.230
 schools the minister landmark consumption of that

 Brazil is a little more than 2000, only the Northeast until the end of the year will be 10 thousand

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.180
 schools with an internet point and the satellite capacity is for 50 thousand

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.710

 here quickly use is a little lacking that the consequences

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:08.330
 the non-obligation of reciprocity seen in four countries japan canada states

 for brazil we have an average pole within brazil that the bay region

 ana but we have an affection inside of Brazil which is the northeast of Brazil

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.250
 we have 6 billion that few countries have the will to nature that fauna and

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.860
 flora and fish truth that we have we have a cerrado the amazon the pope the

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:23.820
 caatinga the wetland so talking about nature in brazil is raining in the wet

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.350
 we have 8,500 kilometers of coastline, we need to disclose this from the waters

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:33.210
 hurricane hot we don’t have around here we don’t have an earthquake

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:38.010
 we have no theory in our brazil we have more than 30 thousand kilometers of rivers

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:43.680
 clean water waterways we now have some corpses for example the price of

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.830
 tickets today was a name today one of the biggest

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.520
 bottlenecks of tourism in brazil is the price of courage

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.630
 the citizen who lives in são paulo who is the biggest emitter of passage another one is more

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.570
 cockroach who leaves sao paulo for australia

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:02.130
 with a package included in a hotel than he left São Paulo to get to know

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:06.840
 12 years old mother and gabriel da waterfall on the dog's head there with the municipality

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:11.490
 of barcelos santa luzia do norte and that are in the waterfall area which are three

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.750
 municipalities together that are bigger than são paulo

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:22.560
 the black river in beautiful web the tourism the change and speaks out diverse then and a

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.900
 Brazilian can’t pay to go there with the precipitate on the tickets today if

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:33.180
 there will be a place where we have our mouth to the ground spoke a lot here speak

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:37.550
 well today mom too before traveling to

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:43.590
 rattlesnake we received a visit from the purchase of fitch casa and soon afterwards announced

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:51.420
 today 6 billion in investments until 2024 and approximately 16 thousand new jobs

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:57.270
 direct and indirect periods are also created there, I think it is very

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:01.909
 important is to first highlight the result

00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:04.909
 positive of the president trip to the united states

00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:10.909
 o the united states supporting the entry of brazil since the 90´s that o

00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:15.469
 Brazil works to join this select group of countries

00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:24.439
 there are 36 countries where there is a country is to internalize the practices in the cd is better

00:08:24.439 --> 00:08:29.689
 not only does its internal governance improve the condition of the arrival of the

00:08:29.689 --> 00:08:35.169
 international investment is part of this process is important right from

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:38.990
 internationalization of the Brazilian economy

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:44.690
 the Brazil of all non-member countries is the most adherent to it is from there and have

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:51.500
 the minister in this of foreign affairs with his team and we are and we see two

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:57.950
 technicians here is from the civilian house one of them is the first doctor set and

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:05.720
 then marcelo barros who is a tcu technician who came to work in our

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.680
 government he is another five years and rebuilds the whole

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.640
 this public governance project in brazil

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:19.610
 monitored by cdf is already president in the transition of our government we already

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:24.920
 we used this process of public governance and today the government for

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:30.680
 employee is in tune with the governance process is recommended

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:36.290
 by it is so strengthening the united states in supporting the entry of the

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:41.930
 Brazil helps us and we estimate that maybe a period between two to three

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:48.230
 years we can be in this select group of countries there with Brazil one more

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:52.820
 opening up its economy what is most important to bring in jobs from

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:57.390
 better quality of life the Brazilians and we send together with the

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:02.880
 same time that I asked a restaurant not to accept this group right

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:09.090
 and he accepted it and immediately afterwards released it and started working on it

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:14.190
 It is also worth saying that I asked for oil for Brazil to be included in the condition

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:19.800
 great ally and affront and two weeks ago he also gave this message to

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:25.950
 American congress to include in this category we will have several advantages in

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:31.260
 defense of power generation among other situations

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:36.750
 so this is also very good because we approach the united states and without leaving

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:40.410
 aside I have other countries that interest us to continue doing

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:44.070
 business as my trip to china is planned in the second semester

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:49.140
 we will be in argentina at the beginning now next month

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.540
 we have a very special population with argentina

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:56.040
 we must not deceive ourselves to exclude the political issues of other countries but

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:01.410
 so we would like that argentina will continue if the path of democracy and

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:06.240
 freedom to come back who was short in government the same thing to come back

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:10.020
 here in Brazil that until recently here also knows the way to blame

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:13.260
 passes inward through venezuela was cheering

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:18.330
 we must announce something more with us when buying machines for

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:24.120
 help argentina you can talk advanced the collection of the wines in the the

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:31.500
 hemosul the good thing is brazil works together with the member countries of the mercosur in a

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:37.880
 agreement is is with the technical community like the european the european common market

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:43.460
 it is very complex right now is the french producers right

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.630
 is to put a series of restrictions but we are working to in a way

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:53.210
 production to be able to give better capacity for competitiveness of Brazilian products

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:59.480
 and expanding the market is an agreement that could yield around 60 more

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:04.130
 billions of dollars a year is and this is very important for the Brazilian economy

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:08.029
 so we are working with care but walking towards this

00:12:08.029 --> 00:12:11.089
 internationalization process of brazil

00:12:11.089 --> 00:12:16.700
 Brazil has to align itself with the countries that are close to the countries that treat

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.540
 with respect for entrepreneurial freedom and at the time republicans who

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:24.740
 regrettably by the days and neurological Brazil came to pass from rich that

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:30.050
 you walk I will tell you who you really are they do not go here and ignore was the

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:35.570
 trade partnerships with economically more but weaker countries than

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:40.220
 that we but want to bring everyone together without ideological bias will start

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:45.529
 you are we also did not travel is to ask for daniel engagement and pledged

00:12:45.529 --> 00:12:50.120
 publicly supported then practically in that country window that presents our

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:56.410
 minister threatened me today among others 90 practically quite

00:12:56.410 --> 00:13:00.250
 right right for us to enter the final right and I do

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:04.690
 it will be all right for us to remember the 70 years of the UN stadium

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:10.690
 is we had the 71st gym in the state of israel

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:19.660
 that and 200 words until we speak here we my our world us

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:25.750
 40s and telling the world by hand a partner who is from that time is just because

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:31.120
 after so many years 50 does not want to midwife israel world by the hands of a

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:40.050
 partner that is to play a great match congratulations izael when we are there

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:53.080
 we signed half a dozen defense and technology and culture agreements

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:58.330
 we have a lot to learn from them we also have huge potential here and

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.420
 this approximation with Celtic being exceptional we now also have in

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:07.650
 middle of the year already everybody on the 20th we have there is private meetings

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.930

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:32.740
 anyway when a ball said here to the public staff of the

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:39.100
 federal police worked the proposal a lot together or

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:44.050
 Even Paulo descends from the economy and got the go-ahead at the pole of big names

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:48.580
 of the prestigious humor is anyone who can do it works and today

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:55.030

 bolsonaro maybe not only in the mainstream media but you

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:41.640
 we do not realize that you are unaware of the importance that this act represents

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:46.540
 we need to transform a professional president today was quoted in

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:50.170
 congress as president of tourism because he is the first president who

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:59.529
 turns not black when the first president was appointed was 14

00:15:59.529 --> 00:16:09.069
 what is transforming the good game chance is actually formed by the piece of the

00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:12.879
 rio Cuiabá where each piece that this championship is like this is the crowd

00:16:12.879 --> 00:16:17.470

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:21.999
 we have several projects including inversion of old age needs to be

00:16:21.999 --> 00:16:26.589
 including Brazilian tourism the whole world uses tourism for everything

00:16:26.589 --> 00:16:30.339
 in old age there is no specific policy where patricia

00:16:30.339 --> 00:16:37.240
 unit more and more people retire in brazil and have the roles we have

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.350
 high and low season why not make a specific policy on participation

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:45.309
 for example also for those over 65 years of age

00:16:45.309 --> 00:16:48.819
 these people suffer from depression a lot of people stay indoors

00:16:48.819 --> 00:16:53.649
 I don’t go out it was for the people in the area that I already talked with a hand of

00:16:53.649 --> 00:16:59.470
 hair and he said he agrees to try 50% kent wells is to have sleep even

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:04.899
 sent a hug said that the tower owned the hotel east will hit will use the

00:17:04.899 --> 00:17:09.100
 back from the michele band of the first our first lady of what she thought I

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:13.630
 am did not have hotel vila galé another orientation this is it

00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:18.250
 transform tourism into state policy like france with spain's

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:24.069
 beautiful of the crisis there is a portugal transformed and came out of the crisis and we will

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:31.929
 make an excuse for meddling the manuel rocket law which is the unlocking of the

00:17:31.929 --> 00:17:37.030
 ours by karzai waheed zaman rocket at a public hearing in the chamber of

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:41.500
 councilors claiming it wasn't here at the breno stadium the shopnow time one day

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:47.140
 I passed this audio from 5 - to the 22 ministers last Tuesday

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:53.320
 in short he wants a small sink right with the house on top to sell him some

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:58.240
 beasts river the egg a class is still family affection and

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:03.429
 then he started talking about the pilgrimage of premium license and license for that

00:18:03.429 --> 00:18:08.350
 is from the end is in the crucible is running away from the police you think table and not five

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:12.760
 minutes listening is dozens of documents that I needed to vote for

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:17.770
 we are running the first tour of his residence that does not believe the 600

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:21.250
 meters today I believe she goes to the bedroom

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:27.610
 walking about 900 meters in length gets complicated so this in

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:33.190
 our mpb part of economic freedom answered it wants to say something

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:39.160
 I think it’s very important president and since his

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:43.480
 campaign is you sir the government has commanded us and

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:48.610
 fulfilled because the commitments assumed and allied the measure used to

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:52.840
 economic freedom for the first time since Brazil is a republic

00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:58.390
 the citizen just one the city comes to the faith of the government and he is right

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:03.309
 he is not a public agent he is right he does not prove anything he goes there

00:19:03.309 --> 00:19:09.490
 clear and easy your craft does its job and manuel rocket and if the

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:13.960
 his attempt was now after the provisional measure that 90% of the problems

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.410
 as long as they exist then they have a spectacular reach

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:23.290
 so president this is important from brazil you know a little bit of married

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:28.630
 I don't take anything better than doing a ping pong that you want to talk

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:33.760
 American Second Amendment of 1780 I always said I will read here being

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:38.679
 necessary the security of a free state the existence of a well-established militia

00:19:38.679 --> 00:19:42.760
 organized the people's right to own deuza a ans

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:48.669
 it cannot be prevented 1791 afterwards we had the independence of brazil

00:19:48.669 --> 00:19:54.669
 in 1822 love games just look that while this amendment here Americans beyond the hour

00:19:54.669 --> 00:19:58.960
 after pubis then we made the decree of two

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:03.529
 weeks and then the justice sheet the prosecutor

00:20:03.529 --> 00:20:10.230
 filed a lawsuit in the supreme is also parliamentarians and parties so it entered

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:14.490
 with the project is the jet to revoke make our secret void

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:18.960
 so we raised here where there was an incidence of complaints about it

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:23.399
 and for us there are no problems with justice or with the camera and putting in

00:20:23.399 --> 00:20:31.529
 risk is the whole decree we studied is together with the general advocacy of

00:20:31.529 --> 00:20:39.330
 union the civilian house of justice the defense was not

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:45.750
 a lot of things are 90% preserved and we mitigated some things in the law that

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:50.159
 intelligence that would have the army responsible for that version of that

00:20:50.159 --> 00:20:54.330
 responsible person of 60 with all due respect not only the head of the teacher is

00:20:54.330 --> 00:21:00.960
 called we will talk and put that without reading the army will

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:07.429
 fulfill because there was misery defense the decree had full support from the minister

00:21:07.429 --> 00:21:14.190
 the defense's fernando then the weapon of authorization is authorized here

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:18.840
 permitted use of fire, right, there were restrictions made by cali 17

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:26.340
 km 44 bardot 45 to 75 7 is still allowed, all linked in limiting the size

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:35.760
 field and prevent someone there over there if anything less than 5 5 meters per

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:40.620
 45 didn’t basically run away from combat so I don’t think anyone until us here

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:46.409
 recognize what would suit you the most, but since the size collection of

00:21:46.409 --> 00:21:52.440
 rifle in rural area ok so just the case rifle scouting

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:56.010
 of the snakes be done by the army command going to rifle

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:59.880
 in addition small arms without any problem

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:04.990
 even the term was in Brazil the concept of

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:10.840
 residence, right, inside your residence, you could not because such and with regard to

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:15.970
 rural property was also in the covered area injury I could have fought and mourned in its

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:19.450
 ownership we allow this so that everyone that everyone

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:25.480
 we will have on your property on your land and that the secretariat will be able to use your soul

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.780
 within 500 hectares without any problem and I say more

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:33.190
 we talked on Sunday, but then you can put together a bill for

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:39.700
 southern authorship is in that line also would not be decree

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:44.530
 law that if approved what avoids any questioning tocantins does not work

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:50.650
 congratulations to our gauchão and rodrigo maia who is also going to the vote and if this

00:22:50.650 --> 00:23:01.240
 project the timeframe of five to ten detail that has been changed and you continue with

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:09.039
 that driver 4 beetle car that wants to drive for example a brasilia

00:23:09.039 --> 00:23:15.850
 valid driver's license any horse in that category and try the

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:21.059
 our record our size and worth for all hours

00:23:21.159 --> 00:23:26.919
 there are people in two classes there also allowing up to two hours a day to take 22

00:23:26.919 --> 00:23:33.730
 records answered there is no reason to leave is full term

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:38.440
 the subjectivity in the car to see that there was no change

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:43.570
 the amount of armament had to have a definition is written in the law and we

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:49.450
 there four weapons of permitted use remain

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:52.539
 for ordinary people except for karts

00:23:52.539 --> 00:23:57.830
 the collector can have five of each model of permitted use and uses

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:02.330
 fried is the hunter 15 each model the sniper 30 of each model

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:05.630
 it's a good size we didn't have that in the past

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:11.769
 despite the ammo limit we put ammo limit and some circumstances

00:24:11.769 --> 00:24:22.630
 thousand per year for weapons and ammunition for restricted use 55 thousand per year for permitted use

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:26.450
 passive extension with authorization from the army authorization from the

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:30.610
 army over 5,000

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:46.600
 is what we have the guarantee of transit a short unisanta for the protection of the cap

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:55.250
 to the next with stability that the square is sergeant Corporal had no bearing

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:59.929
 depends on a vision of the commander and now the decree guaranteed him to leave

00:24:59.929 --> 00:25:08.860
 nor against the military of the paid reserve in tocantins 2

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:19.789
 and he is in that situation that proof of the necessary staff

00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:23.690
 and you don’t need it here, it’s already guaranteed to remove the proof of

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:32.210
 effective in that there he follows as if he were a civilian who seeks to obtain his possession

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:37.010
 in its firearm possession the market opening module the monopoly

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:42.940
 was broken will portal power out takes effect two months from now

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:49.500
 for example, I didn’t want to offend when preparing for countries.

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:55.370
 weapons and we are doing something to say what you citizen decide 2005

00:25:55.370 --> 00:26:01.019
 because we created a referendum to say about Brazil we will not be able to continue

00:26:01.019 --> 00:26:06.269
 selling weapons and ammunition or worked hard on it that the vote did not

00:26:06.269 --> 00:26:14.669
 we won the trophy approximately two thirds 65% even 65% in the stage

00:26:14.669 --> 00:26:19.049
 since then allowing the purchase of arms and ammunition only that the

00:26:19.049 --> 00:26:23.820
 governments that was at that time the pt did not do what the pt likes everything been

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:29.159
 in the hand since that more than authoritarian bias and a ball of string

00:26:29.159 --> 00:26:36.000
 commerce calling the people to them they imposed a criminal calling mother

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.559
 so I'm a criminal thug could have if he had anything not everyone could

00:26:40.559 --> 00:26:45.929
 have thought I don't know but it would be in favor of releasing the idea but neither

00:26:45.929 --> 00:26:48.419
 this happened the quality continues to increasingly

00:26:48.419 --> 00:26:54.360
 mark and increased if the number of deaths with this direction we will not repeat here

00:26:54.360 --> 00:27:02.010
 in my hand firearm possession decree at the end of January was better

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:06.440
 it arrived at the beginning of February for the entire anti-crime project

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:13.409
 and we had a 24% reduction in the number of deaths from firearms

00:27:13.409 --> 00:27:17.210
 if you had to increase responsible credit

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:21.640
 miss osama same way would also be would be crucified at that time is

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:26.010
 exactly the content is the same thing we want to reduce the number of

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:31.179
 traffic accidents that can make a bold decision

00:27:31.179 --> 00:27:36.909
 talked with benicio tests of the structure was on the table in almost 10

00:27:36.909 --> 00:27:43.000
 I did not ask for orders for 8 mi few new sparrows new electronic spines can

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.980
 to lose the caxias to shelter the clea captain like me but the old dream of

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:52.450
 that he then athlete if he wins does not have new new priests and on roads

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:58.510
 federal government have a pension after some small groups to the place the deviation does not

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:02.649
 have the code you nobody is the team has a curve in the front but a bluff

00:28:02.649 --> 00:28:09.159
 at km 80 95 I soon noticed that there that I to mount the guy okay

00:28:09.159 --> 00:28:15.250
 then and the federal statements the contracts are expiring right

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:22.029
 we are not going to renew it so if it has for the new and spanish highway and it worked

00:28:22.029 --> 00:28:25.630
 we must not believe that the municipality says it believes in you citizen

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:30.580
 that you responsible completed your duty and mandate tv hanna is small the

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:35.200
 economic freedom believe in whoever wants to produce believe in the driver if

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.980
 so I repeat here next week we will reach the final of

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:43.870
 our president rodrigo maia and davi a condo there we also have a good

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:49.169
 relationship that sheds a provisional measure for this change in the code

00:28:49.169 --> 00:29:00.460
 of transit and the mayor owes three things here which i think is important

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:08.330
 the first of which is the official who is the first president since the referendum

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:14.169
 and respected the decision that the Brazilian population takes all the rest

00:29:14.169 --> 00:29:17.269
 contradicted the decision a little bit that morning

00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:23.059
 what we are guaranteeing with an arms possession decree and now the

00:29:23.059 --> 00:29:28.630
 decree that organizes snipers and hunters collectors we we are

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:34.549
 guaranteeing the free option the free right the person chooses whether or not he wants to have

00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:38.090
 a call now for her to be okay guys

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:43.929
 it has rules and conditions that it must comply with and finally it was a commitment

00:29:43.929 --> 00:29:49.039
 from the president of the condition here a rural producer anywhere in the

00:29:49.039 --> 00:29:56.240
 brazil the local producer she could have the weapon for her daily life

00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:00.740
 a gun on a farm she’s like any other instrument she’s part of

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:06.260
 of people's lives and for example we have situations is on the border with the

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:11.179
 uruguay to argentina and paraguay very serious provoked by the wild boars the

00:30:11.179 --> 00:30:16.850
 wild boar when it crossed our port and it acquires a capacity a

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:22.630
 impressive aggressiveness is that they eat for example if there were 50 60 70

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:28.210
 lambs they eat of the condemned attack dogs attacked people

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:35.360
 prefer people and have already killed people so we need to have this

00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.990
 defense condition it is not possible to be in the middle of the field makes a police

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:42.950
 presented there where the nearest police station is 100 kilometers from

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:45.180
 farm he needs to have the scheme

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:50.400
 the actor came out in defense of the president this is to give the citizen the right

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:55.710
 Brazilian that we have been denied since 2005 the concerts in Beijing

00:30:55.710 --> 00:31:02.270
 the question of the boar boot on google plays neither attacks and will see each scene and

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:06.450
 terrible damage from attacking and killing humans

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:14.790
 that's it, they breed themselves despite the monstrous 70 a year each couple fran and

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:19.590
 band called meta in geometric progression so hunting is the only home

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:22.800
 liberated brazil even so some states have the registration because it depends

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.070
 of the state at the most there is no obligation to

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:29.760
 home but she wants from me she has no admiration for a car in brazil confirmed

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:37.230
 that the president is important to give a compliment to the team of sage of the subchefia

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:45.690
 legal framework that gives openness and work to the whole government because the first

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:51.680
 decree according to the decree did not have the personalities people confused it right

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:56.610
 unconditionality with the question of merit and all questions of medium

00:31:56.610 --> 00:32:01.290
 needed to be adjusted it was not even a second decree so I want here

00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:07.500
 to say that the team brought safety president to you and most importantly

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:11.700
 gave tranquility to those who are there on the edge who need to look for the excellent

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:20.250
 work done by the chief of the passage jorge oliveira is not a police major

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:25.140
 military df is the name of the gang already had a big hug to all policemen

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:29.580
 enter Brazil through the representative you have, among others

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:39.600
 here inside they help them and a lot in that area the last news the approval of 70 and 80

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:46.140
 it was approved the af was there for the justice continues the

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:50.470
 no executive until he is voted next week

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:57.999
 you are the senate that must approve what was voted for in the deputies chamber and

00:32:57.999 --> 00:33:03.009
 we will follow more important guidelines, right? our ps counter top craze is a house

00:33:03.009 --> 00:33:09.100
 of him to be quite young some still think that the whole unit will still

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:13.389
 not even have time to see you will lose a vote without any problem and whoever has

00:33:13.389 --> 00:33:17.799
 more vote takes now our bench will not hinder polls

00:33:17.799 --> 00:33:21.519
 in what depends on me I want because the sentence marked people who are going

00:33:21.519 --> 00:33:25.149
 working does not logically send the free ones does not believe in

00:33:25.149 --> 00:33:29.919
 work death and in that sense that is joice rossi may in rio for work

00:33:29.919 --> 00:33:36.669
 in this sense so that we seek in the best possible way to serve the people but

00:33:36.669 --> 00:33:42.940
 parliament is more than authority has the legitimacy to change these

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:49.570
 people I have but presenting for years in Brazil we arrived and 39

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:55.090
 ministries that was a job hanger the political sponsored we approved

00:33:55.090 --> 00:34:02.919
 today the result of the president's decision is a structure with 22 ministries that are

00:34:02.919 --> 00:34:09.790
 lean teams to serve brazil next week employees so what

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:15.669
 I ask my released he the party will ask for old caution that now that

00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:22.210
 passed in the chamber is a symbolic vote lightning in the attack and touches touches the boat

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:27.760
 we will not go more than 95 percent of what is good so logically the parliament

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:33.940
 made his change haiti will encourage to recognize and this he does well for the

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:36.059
 democracy

00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:41.220
