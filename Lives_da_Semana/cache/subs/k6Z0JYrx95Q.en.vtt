00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
good night everyone we are in brasília 19 hours

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.820
 Thursday, May 9, in a little while, you will be introduced to the people of my

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.430
 side here we have a lot of news today including two teams not with me

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.300
 today it will definitely stretch the river for 15 minutes

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.359
 at the end of tomorrow morning if god willing he is at the mouth of the iguaçu where

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.420
 we will then be laying the cornerstone of the construction of the second

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.829
 bridge over the paraná river and that was on paper for 30 years and he will god

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.399
 tomorrow it leaves the paper and work effectively begins because it is very

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.140
 important our relationship with paraguay is

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.289
 a country that has been growing in the last few years is just over 5% is a

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.059
 country that has really changed fully understand its policy since the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.369
 ex-president lugo's departure the one that she catted him with dilma with squid

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.950
 as morales is with chavez that guys from the sheet of são paulo o paraguay

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.470
 changed a lot with the president emeritus and we are more and more

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.479
 integrating and the pie will be in curitiba 16 hours

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.689
 our minister of justice security sergio moura will be inaugurating the center

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.990
 integrated public security and intelligence

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.930
 tomorrow 16 hours in curitiba now a rare thing right

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.180
 everything is so rare, not that everyone knows the capacity of the Brazilian

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.549
 Brazilian is everywhere in the world as I was recently and Taiwan and there

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:59.590
 I found believe offers ok it is doing barbarities in itown the head

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:07.179
 it was even comparable to install in that one far away than logical part of the

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.400
 game apart from the globe in almost half the globe, it’s almost 20 thousand than a screen

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.920
 and even now we have elisângela in our language intern

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:25.599
 of pounds and here we have the doctor idemar maciel does not like it can be sure he is

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.150
 plastic surgeon is not for you to look beautiful not pretty ok you know this is not going

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.150
 like it says here because it really is a person that five years ago together with

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.849
 the former colleague on the side right here is a survey on burning

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.049
 burns is using the tin face here on my right

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:52.420
 Mr. Marcelo Borges, who is the exact idealizer of research with the foot

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.579
 allow it started sunday 14 on sunday 14 the research here and the end to end

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:03.310
 right there rodrigo moraes who is a professor at unip weighed in the university

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.700
 federal of Ceará here Ceará here Paraiba there

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.630
 you appear that you are operating in a paraibano you from the river's undine

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.220
 so I'm going to pass the word doctor to say a little bit about what this research

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.280
 that pet can is something inertia in everyone and only Brazil is in this

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.040
 research with all certainty in the final fact to be used and in the fall to the people who

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.459
 perhaps it is necessary because the author of the bush thank you president

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.870
 developed by uefs and it came to revolutionize the treatment of burns

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.389
 and fitness first that tilapia skin is easy to get everywhere

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:55.329
 second because it is a skin that goes to waste so its production below

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.889
 cost compared to the treatments you have but imagine a burnt child

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:05.799
 for a hot liquid that must be hospitalized for 11 to 12 days and every day has to

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.850
 do this dressing this dressing change

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:14.700
 some poetry other day filmmakers which causes a lot of pain until the unit there by

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.620
 dengue in the wound with this it avoids contamination of the

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.970
 from the outside to the inside avoids the loss of liquids in the area

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.790
 burned but mainly due to the daily dressing changes that in the

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.960
 second degree burn it stays from the hour it puts until the end of the

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.180
 treatment when it is removed without counting it reduces all the work of the

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.840
 team reduces all the suffering of the family and decreases the costs for the network

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.020
 public who is responsible for research today it is already in six countries

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.850
 happening in the form of research six states also here in brazil

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:02.370
 today, 189 employees participate in this survey with us

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.560
 here I want to thank everyone for their participation, commitment and

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.940
 dedication that shows our brazil president that it is possible to develop

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.730
 quality research in that country in our northeast in our lord

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.680
 we just have to thank everyone who supports us and participates with us in

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.280
 research so just go there for I am from the countryside

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:33.600
 from são paulo is known as carcarah also treats you like the [ __ ] you can

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.720
 see who has a small hydro power plant

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.300
 let's assume it's up to one hectare at 100% water you product can produce

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:48.300
 per year from 10 tons to 15 tons of tilapia so that raw material in

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.490
 abundance here our brazil summarizing what he said about who

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:59.340
 store heard is related to a neighbor friend who suffered burns because someone from

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.170
 peace to a cafe with waters in manaus arena headquarters in the heavens and a child fell

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.730
 car not even a burn that the iraq which second degree 2nd degree

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:14.040
 or someone approaching the São João River is drinking a cachaça

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.930
 with a head full of cachaça and fell on top of the Brazilian jô and stays there for

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.530
 example a few seconds that day burn that does not want can be

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:28.320
 stick second deep third dog treatment paradise tilapia skin cost

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.720
 infinite directly is not elementary of the very crazy river price of the traditional of

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:40.440
 nowadays also the reduction of 12 and imagined changing the dressing and two ago

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.930
 which is a mediator and the time of treatment also decreases is to decrease a

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.860
 day we second degree burns and almost two days on the burns of

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.300
 deep second degree and appearance at the end of traditional treatment and since

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.290
 there is also better lapa not to mention that this is the first skin

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:03.450
 animal in brazil that can be registered at anvisa and the first animal skin

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:07.320
 aquatic world studied for this purpose

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.490
 looks only recently and twice with people

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:17.910
 the ambassador of japan where we offer them our Amazon region to

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:23.370
 research with the extensive biodiversity that we have there

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:28.290
 if we take a nap we will come to that with all certainty making a strong partnership

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.610
 partnership with the country any other in the case here i mentioned here japan

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:39.450
 imagine what we can achieve in that region even maybe

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:46.260
 cured is to win steps towards the cure of being of many diseases besides being more

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.790
 faster and more accurate and we achieve the goal that we want is theirs

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:58.380
 here is to bring the benefit to our population here

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:02.220
 one thing but yes i would just like to add president that this research

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.450
 it was all developed at the federal university of ceará is at

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:11.580
 research center developed for medicines that ampa although it is

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:17.670
 maintained a private sponsorship has been financed is with a private company

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:21.390
 in reality it was developed within the public university in all

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:26.580
 researchers were they were related position is teachers at

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.540
 federal university of ceara i would like to conclude just saying

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:36.600
 that we are all committed to trying to make sure that brazil doesn't lose

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:43.290
 this opportunity to avoid missing out on this great opportunity to incorporate a

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:48.510
 pioneering biological dressing in a little more here right

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:53.010
 let's go on the same line plus a slightly different path

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:58.080
 today i talked to the son of an ex sarney minister

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:03.810
 he was that gentleman he was sarney's minister of science and technology and he is

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.800
 a researcher too and what is the day dedicated to

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.480
 on the issue of graphene that also exists at the federal university of Ceará

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.220
 great researcher there professor antónio gomes de souza filho who is dedicated to

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:22.080
 traffic research then antónio gomes de souza filho one more researcher from

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:28.440
 graphene at uefs and look at these people showing up and this person from today

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.200
 in contact with the son we will find in contact with the father with a great

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:38.460
 researcher who specializes in the strain taking graphene out of graphite when

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.360
 talked about during the campaign is about that there were a lot of people who did with the

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:47.610
 mischievous pranks maybe super smart person ok but

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:51.480
 that didn’t present anything new to the world so graphene is a

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:56.760
 reality and if those who get a technology to take with a quantity

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:04.020
 separating graphene from graphite for sure is that it will be a leap for this

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:09.870
 country for those who have the patent this way of achieving this separation

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:14.220
 which is january research are the uses the graphene its infinite sky

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:18.870
 that story repeating what ever heard a graphene wire raises an elephant one

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:24.089
 government grass pay a football pitch because it confesses the first time

00:10:24.089 --> 00:10:27.269
 what he said i was even worried i'm talking about you this is the only one

00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:32.370
 plan plan plan the head molecules personal touch

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:37.230
 the more demand is played in the same group and formed a kind of screen

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:41.519
 we have a jorge a young girl recently graduated from the military institute of

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:45.990
 engineering that is on the drawing board a graphene canvas that the earth does said

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:52.950
 analyzes sea water or land the brackish water table water and also days

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:59.670
 analyzes and transforms them into drinking water imagine and jadilson in the northeast here there is the

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:05.519
 how far we are from treating the water is all really drinking water with

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:08.940
 this technology that belongs to a Brazilian where he is

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:13.050
 as far as i know is england but if god wants the landmarks bridges

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:17.640
 astronaut formed by ita according to nasa has long been

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:23.010
 also working hard on this collection I spoke to him today he must

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.920
 talk to the researchers the moment lives in campinas

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.880
 to add our team to the team that I didn’t contact you haven’t asked for the phone yet

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:36.180
 their side of our researcher at uefs eaeb as the people at da marquinhas

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:40.620
 in são paulo even because it is graphite, it has a picture all over the world more than good

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:45.209
 we have quality here in Brazil but not even catho was worth it guys

00:11:45.209 --> 00:11:49.680
 the Brazilian has no limit this Brazilian is the one that has a solution for

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.449
 everything but that I traveled also switched to places does wonderful research as

00:11:54.449 --> 00:11:59.220
 this one on the skin of the tilapia with stars on my side here the staff is 11 3

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:02.699
 we will run with other materials here because we have a lot of news for

00:12:02.699 --> 00:12:07.440
 pass to you is not today, just present only here in the capital of paraíba

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.130
 and ceara thank you very much

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:16.680
 the [ __ ] fight when I return I will continue here so now it's yesterday

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.860
 we present daughter Marcos Bridges right

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:25.930
 in a teleconference with the kids from a school well the inter use there in the inter

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:31.840
 used amanda cavalcante grease at kalunga school and what was presented

00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:36.760
 for this reason we have a satellite that costs taking into account the

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:42.490
 its useful life, its price, right, and in the courses, its thousand reais a day and

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:46.270
 that max 11 she started doing since the beginning of

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:52.330
 year two years ago trying to space and there is no we were afraid 0 points

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:57.540
 here in brazil what point does this serve for internet signals for example

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:02.170
 we had only half a dozen pompous but bosco his work together with his

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:07.680
 team on this issue today we have 2,800 points in Brazil

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:16.150
 2,800 points is and 2010 points being that more than a little more than 2 thousand are

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:21.940
 northeast and today the wife inside the schools will not have an antenna 1 the router

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:28.840
 is a wi fi signal within 300 meters and the kids then

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:34.420
 2006 schools that reached the 1 million student mark are having access

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:39.940
 to the internet by the end of the year, max posted that it will install 10,000

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:45.550
 internet points in schools and also communities and we have the capacity

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:51.070
 for 50 thousand points so big leap in information via

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:55.480
 internet now are you feeling the need we don't have technology and we have

00:13:55.480 --> 00:14:00.600
 technology is doing satellite we have here the launch center of alcântara

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:05.560
 that convinced the former governor of maranhão flávio dino we deal with this

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.040
 matter and is fully in favor that the channel

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.760
 the alcântara launch center talk again

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:16.560
 besides we don’t have the technology to make a satellite if god wants we’ll have a

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:21.360
 it will take time to leave because the Brazilian really doesn’t have no limits

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:26.160
 then this program called g looting and e-government service

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.610
 service to the citizen, so the whole school in Brazil must have

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:34.800
 a phone call from mayor marketing councilman and there is no internet you want

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.680
 voting at school will logically have a relationship of

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:42.570
 priorities the goal is to serve the region more than one

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:48.240
 name is north and northeast now that it has changed is that the team on the side

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:56.870
 here we have here the hug will go out that same day but it is our best to study

00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:02.910
 of education to talk about the collection of funds for university we have here

00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:06.930
 gilson today will talk about nautical ecotourism

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:12.390
 I’m in love with the month or diving and there at the right end is the name of the bottom of the

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:17.370
 mar the director jorge safe son of júlio

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:26.700
 knee that will talk about your from your trip now some countries like countries

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:31.080
 the city also had new york dealing with tuna quota in brussels

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:35.220
 about the opening of the fish market to us Brazilians

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:39.150
 and it is with this or the closed text registration insurance by phone

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:44.730
 let's start the first one here our minister of education the role that will

00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:48.960
 then deal with this issue, which is a bit of a controversy, but it will be

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.590
 really what's going on in the ministry of education and the thing of

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:57.990
 also budgetary resource brom chairman word has a lot of people who

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:02.340
 is spreading terror and saying things that are not happening

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:08.070
 what are we preparing the economy of brazil until you are

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:12.190
 elected she was sinking the people that I stopped in fear of

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:18.730
 buying clothes had decreased in file to purchases must or not to exchange a

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:22.840
 television fridge now of a free

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.890
 we talked about sinking but Brazil still hasn't taken off because you still have

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:31.870
 a lot of uncertainty regarding the new pension, the country's accounts are like

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:35.800
 the accounts of a family we are still in a very difficult situation

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.880
 delicate how do i translate the situation Paulo

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:44.800
 guedes and he had to do that the law tells us to contingency to insure a

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:51.630
 little not cut back hold a little spending not only in the ministry of education

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:56.040
 who is responsible but in all ministries we are

00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:00.850
 holding a little to comply with the law and not finish like the previous government

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:04.810
 who spent more broke the law and generates inflation

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:08.890
 so we have to insure it I wanted to explain how much this is

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:11.830
 people are doing what they like chocolate for example

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:16.270
 opa imagine the following can not take chocolate will eat Belgian chocolate

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:20.050
 prestige sir the act of reals the most reports that is

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:24.670
 offering maybe there’s no fun there’s nothing better than someone paying for

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:28.210
 in case I paid for the chocolate but I offered it to the girls who had more mothers

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:32.560
 offering chocolate tastes more disgusting way of saying how am I going

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.870
 explain this imagine the following we have a budget

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:45.820
 we have more or less no chocolate each box that has 25 chocolate I

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:50.290
 I'll put the question make a lot of mess president would take to take up

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:57.120
 I'm going to play has 25 chocolate on the top already the engine

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.980
 author everything here has more or if it was like this

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:10.800
 that here is missing here there are 25 more latina and the role more 25

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:17.850
 chocolatinho each one imagines a normal university like this that we

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:20.760
 see around what we are doing with them

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:29.100
 she usually they have a real opinion thinking per year

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.910
 some go wrong university 1 billion a year some have a few more

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:38.190
 have almost 43 and a half some - but let's assume one as soon as we meet with

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:41.670
 more easily one billion reais a year

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:46.110
 this money comes from the ear seeing your taste why do you pay tax for

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:50.400
 buy chocolate to pay and they are the cell phone

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:55.470
 so what happens at this point is everyone holding on tightening their belts

00:18:55.470 --> 00:19:00.990
 we are not walking anyone even though all wages are

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:06.090
 preserved anyone if it were a company is difficult

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:10.050
 a company in a bakery we sometimes have to send people away in a

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:13.260
 this situation nobody will be sent away all

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:17.280
 the world is receiving technical teacher everyone

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:23.670
 we are also talking look at all the help that the student receives from

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:29.280
 refectory and housing is preserved and we are asking for

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:37.740
 simply q3 chocolatinhos three of those in chocolate 3 end chocolates

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:45.390
 the new attacking sock that left just cut here 3 chocolates and mail

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:51.150
 we are not talking to people, we don’t have this chocolate for years and

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:53.550
 we are not talking to the person

00:19:53.550 --> 00:20:02.250
 that we are going to cut a cut dinner lets eat after that time just

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:06.480
 what we are asking for is to hold a little

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.110
 now I ask myself president has already gone through a situation like this of having in

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:15.030
 tuohy predictions a difficulty in life spoke so held if someone was

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:21.179
 so three and a half chocolatinhos three and a half percent of those without three and a half by

00:20:21.179 --> 00:20:26.460
 cent safe because the salary is fully preserved and paid the day after

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:32.250
 people have all the help to the students preserved and now they were waiting for the

00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:36.210
 people are closing everything else, president

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:42.900
 we are receiving all readers all readers who want to talk

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:46.380
 with us to discuss a specific project that they don’t have money if

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:50.340
 want to talk show the numbers if you want to do it at the congress

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:54.600
 we are always willing to talk but it seems that there is a governor of a

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:59.580
 state that he has state university and cut the students point is not

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:09.150
 federal university will stick with something copies car if you so if you're

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:13.559
 here thank you very much and thanks for the explanation

00:21:13.559 --> 00:21:21.630
 next week is to vote on thursday the time is in dallas and keep our

 ours will veto but we also have what to say to you

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:34.140
 so for me it's here to thank at least at the beginning the bram van dyck station

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:39.690
 the radio that you listen to here is obliged to education, yes, the Minister of

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:42.909
 sport he is a university professor

00:21:42.909 --> 00:21:50.330
 is a manager and is doing a job that must be done there will leave here the

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:55.340
 university are preserved doesn’t exist all the time, so much nonsense is said

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:59.149
 is to see the government on the 11th claiming to cut 10 billion

00:21:59.149 --> 00:22:04.039
 nobody says anything we don't treat it we just put it aside to be able to consume

00:22:04.039 --> 00:22:11.840
 later I wake up with the progress of our economy that passes the word here

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:18.860
 there are three subjects for jorge feel a young man and a minute what are you going to do in

00:22:44.269 --> 00:22:49.610
 it will be in october and november and we employ we had a very tough way because today

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:54.500
 most catch quotas that act catch quotas are not are

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:59.690
 designated by the countries and is an international body called kate so the

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:03.889
 producers who work with tuna fishermen, we went there at the time representing the

00:23:03.889 --> 00:23:08.779
 Brazil and speak of a hard time for him to evaluate the question of quotas for

00:23:08.779 --> 00:23:12.500
 developing countries which is the case in brazil until october we did a

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:16.580
 work for the first subject is dealt with here is something else

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:22.490
 today in a special commission that analyzes the provisional measure on restructuring

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:28.580
 of the government is one of the measures taken by the commission, it remains to be endorsed by the

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:32.720
 penalty may not happen are getting the coaf from the domain of

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:38.240
 justice ie a wall and sending the ministry of economics to paulo guedes

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:45.289
 expects the plenary of the chamber and senate to keep the coercion of the cross in court because

00:23:45.289 --> 00:23:50.919
 is a very strong tool in the world our girl is another one to fight

00:23:50.919 --> 00:23:55.720
 increase money laundering and corruption among other measures

00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:02.320
 ok, enjoy it quickly but it was only worth it because of the pecha de pernambuco I see

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.860
 that's right that's right then you will speak in court

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:11.020
 of eco nautical tourism in 2008 josué are not dying next week in the

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:16.900
 ministry of the environment of the 1st workshop of the project revitalization plan

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:23.080
 original as brazil because brazil today has number 1 in the world

00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.830
 but we are number 1 in the world in natural riches in natural beauty according to

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:31.690
 world tourism organization and we need to transform that real number

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:36.340
 ecotourism and ebt tourism throughout the economy

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:41.679
 productive chain of 52 types of activities from the airplane pilot the pilot and

00:24:41.679 --> 00:24:48.460
 already on the cruise and across a coastline encompasses that we have more than 8,500

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:52.059
 kilometers of coastline we have over 35 thousand kilometers of

00:24:52.059 --> 00:24:56.169
 images of river problems in nine more ponds kiosks

00:24:56.169 --> 00:25:02.740
 we will be able to do various nautical activities

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:07.870
 officers sinking the ship so that the fauna comes so that there is another side

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:11.320
 contemplative we can do nal activity because the

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:15.669
 sport fishing we can make marine piles so

00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:19.149
 we are going to do this roadshow to just listen to the whole chain that

00:25:19.149 --> 00:25:24.460
 involves the industry chain there is no revenue chain that here calculates and

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:28.929
 fees and taxes today that are very high in brazil for importing clay

00:25:28.929 --> 00:25:33.940
 for importing electronics for importing engines and parts that serve

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:37.630
 for the nautical industry anyway let's do everything is there so that

00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:40.720
 we can really transform it into real numbers

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.600
 the number 1 post in the world and natural beauty

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:49.500
 Brazil today occupies the 27th place in receiving foreign tourists in the world and

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:54.070
 we are the third goal in the south spot and luckily but we will change the

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:58.120
 old village I have no doubt about it another thing the tj the conotel president

00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:03.250
 which is the national congress of hotels in goiânia and the staff is very excited

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:08.200
 very satisfied with the numbers that are already being glimpsed for example the

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:12.100
 violence has decreased in the country we have 50 is to see if percent yesterday

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:18.400
 it was unanimous even the president of da bh manuelzinho sent waves from you

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:22.360
 congratulated the person when to prove an old project of the hill is going

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:26.500
 to further reduce violence in brazil the outlook for the number of

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.289
 foreign tourists increasingly grows

00:26:29.289 --> 00:26:34.960
 only one visa opening for japan united states canada and australia is the

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:39.820
 demand has increased by around 75% so I have no doubt that if the

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:46.299
 Brazil wants to get out of the unemployment that we are struggling to be in

00:26:46.299 --> 00:26:49.809
 only four months we will have to invest in tourism

00:26:49.809 --> 00:26:55.510
 because today we have around 45 to 50 percent of idle capacity and hotels

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:58.510
 closed the hotel owner with the key in hand and a

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:04.929
 closed room waiting for us to reach non-reciprocity since it has already increased the

00:27:04.929 --> 00:27:10.480
 confirmation of can pass of airline tickets is from other countries to here is

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:15.730
 true because for sure the other bottleneck was detected yesterday is the price

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:19.030
 of air tickets this is absurd today you are a

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:21.309
 passage in reef for example brasília

00:27:21.309 --> 00:27:27.460
 you pay at least around 1,200 reais 1 leg a large form element

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:31.799
 we need why can we have from brasilia want to do a training in brazil

00:27:31.799 --> 00:27:38.440
 capitalized and take it to reef 1,200 a cheap one is to have new penalty day

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:42.820
 Brazilian fadda will have two and a half thousand reais each for manaus to

00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:46.210
 go back to porto alegre do not know where he is not going to do tourism on the river

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:51.039
 that way you will not do tourism you can see the weight and cms of that of those between

00:27:51.039 --> 00:27:55.299
 the são paulo actions are the smallest here in brazil o rio de janeiro that the favela is

00:27:55.299 --> 00:28:01.360
 one thing now because it ends up encouraging that more homeland flights a year

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.690
 cheaper fuel and leaves americana all over brazil

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:10.450
 I found out before yesterday's 7 May treadmill that I was in

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:15.130
 negotiation of formula 1 for rio de janeiro

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:19.990
 I learned that the São Paulo government the mayor dollar already had participation

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:24.970
 none of that and I don’t want to cause the fight and rain was none

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:28.000
 now there the decision the initiative to go there

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.230
 as far as i know are from the organizers themselves who would leave brazil

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:37.740
 he more using his word of view we have winning the election was not

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:42.580
 that other who came in second place and decided to keep in Brazil and solve

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:47.350
 it in an instruction field of the army camp of camboatá where the

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:50.530
 1st battalion of special forces there in rio de janeiro

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:54.220
 they will build once everything is agreed to avoid walking in that direction in

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:57.040
 few months will build this formula 1 track

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:03.370
 so that as it is next year we will have formula 1 in brazil is that

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:07.030
 the people from são paulo all respect is now i'm going to são paulo has a fight

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:10.280
 no drops coming back who knows afterwards will pass can praise

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:14.750
 the land for manaus wherever this is all over brazil what can not is the

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:22.040
 formula 1 i left brazil quickly go back to our dear one here jorge

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:27.440
 cenci ne cause of the flood of sludge in the bottom ground zero one minute meeting in

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:32.780
 brussels the opening of europe for our fish had people there we left

00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:37.520
 new york that we had a confirmation through the air of the ambassador's work

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:42.140
 marcos galvão his team there in brussels they got a meeting there for us

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:48.309
 since general health management was what prevented brazil from

00:29:48.309 --> 00:29:52.790
 export fish to europe to give you an idea whole families

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:59.450
 lobster tuna is a crab fisherman's many chains producers

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:04.190
 productive worked frog fish work specifically for the market

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:07.550
 European and overnight we lost to surround him

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:13.130
 let's speak english is doctor watson who was very hard of course saying look

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:17.690
 of 2012 I had already said that I was going to close the Brazilian market because you

 due to the leniency of the old governments but I already said look I'm here he went to

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:37.520

 wednesday and thursday created by ex-president bush also

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:03.290
 with Senator Ted Cruz among other authorities and Brazilian businessmen

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:09.270
 to make that window that we would do in new york to receive then that

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:13.610
 that award on the part of that brazil-united states trade

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:21.360
 ending in serrano started in the decree of 10 on the quays actually loved that kaka

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:26.790
 who is a collector and sniper and hunter shutting down the couple is lost and not

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:32.070
 there is a relationship of hunting in Brazil the only house released

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:36.960
 with the exception of brazil grandson is worth nothing more than that nobody will release that

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:42.470
 I know it's the case of the law field there is no danger hunting and capillary the class animal

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:45.980
 urban power

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:55.470
 I didn’t say anything about the house and the tattoo that was in a field there with all

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:58.770
 sure house some from time to time he case is not released

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:05.010
 so among other things deciding the decree here the country man

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:09.840
 possession of a firearm that she does inside her residence throughout the

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:15.300
 farm territory to descend 215 thousand hectares he will be able to walk with the gun

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:21.870
 on the waist and if the person had possession of a firearm only is the possession had

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:28.140
 entitled to 50 cartridges per year will be entitled to a thousand now 20 times more is that

00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:32.520
 the monopoly ends logically does not apply to a rifle but it will be able to buy the

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:37.020
 weaponry in the form of powder in the next live and go into detail the Cade is this is a

00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:40.440
 important thing is also the possession of a firearm

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:44.580
 goes for all weapons imagine you have a beetle at home take your wallet from

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:48.800
 then you buy a simca chambord

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:52.520
 took it from the bottom of the chest in islet santa catarina county now called time

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:59.990
 out here while the blue model you don’t look it looks the same clear

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:06.560
 real wallet for possession possession of all your weapons

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:12.260
 i think it is a good size i think it finds in the promise of

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:19.190
 campaign we are within the limits of the law in force and do not reflect the matter here

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:23.720
 has certain and that god takes me out of my respect that if I go to say that the

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:28.100
 lies that tell us we take part of this thing I'm talking about here

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:32.690
 black with truth nowadays any accusation against comes

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:40.040
 since everything is filmed and recorded in brazil it requires a detail for two weeks

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:47.750
 with your name I wanted to talk nonsense it would be nonsense again

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:51.680
 that active word nor the newspapers say anything about who got the stronghold

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:57.800
 started talking nonsense and crusoe is crusoé collaborating you talk nonsense that

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:02.300
 I would have a way, the green has won over no public, nothing ever imagined with 15

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:06.200
 journalists talking nonsense like the one that the noblat published I would have

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:12.980
 I was massacred then it’s over, I’m not going to dabó

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:16.580
 also indicating an increase in barbarity is a child thing

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:22.400
 I didn't go beyond the limit of the law It's not just campaign commitments like me

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:27.440
 it was possible if reached we are fulfilled the campaign commitments the

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:32.090
 that the cohesion of the cacti took a little bit aids said because it is not easy

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:39.020
 you in a decree-law and achieving is doing justice has some rules and in a way

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:43.310
 very fast without delay a little more consultations from one consultation is ours

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:51.080

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:55.869
 legal position is going to be the defense is going to need justice obtained the pain

00:36:55.869 --> 00:37:00.160
 people of the people and within the limits of the law we regulate day by day

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:06.369

00:37:06.369 --> 00:37:09.609
 something else right I wish I had the power to do so

00:37:09.609 --> 00:37:15.400
 who would have asked says that the postage extends to December and categories do not

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:19.569
 nowadays you have a firearm that had to prove the effective

00:37:19.569 --> 00:37:26.230
 need that we vote the state that has a number equal to or greater than three

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:31.799
 deaths by dengue day trial by fire for being reissued is considered here the

00:37:31.799 --> 00:37:38.079
 manned us ez is guaranteed its effective need for proven

00:37:38.079 --> 00:37:43.630
 according to the statistical yearbook 2016 total of brazil was above 10 knots

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:47.470
 for being military now to carry a firearm you have

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:52.749
 that proving the effectiveness in this is also another issue is not only the ten deaths

00:37:52.749 --> 00:37:55.930
 per 100 thousand inhabitants so that other proofs we do not vote

00:37:55.930 --> 00:38:01.299
 categories there we may even have been speaking maybe even missing other categories total
