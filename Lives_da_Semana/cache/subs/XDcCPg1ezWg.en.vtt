 after real decades now we do have the real culture secretary and meets the

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.670
 interest of the majority of the Brazilian population to the conservative population

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.420
 Christian thank you so much for doing this mission

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.280
 in this action I already knew that it’s not easy, right, but I’m playing with it until the last

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.910
 strand of hair we will win this battle that here is right here could only be

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.840
 right right our embrace vanthauze our minister

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.649
 of education is when I invited you knew that your mission would not be easy is the

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.590
 ministry has almost 300 thousand employees present a thousand president

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:11.860
 many problems an education that did not work until the end of the last government

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.870
 so much so that the Pisa test proves this is a low rear last place

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.750
 in south america it was this and so in bolivia who took the exam of the countries that

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.049
 take until bolivia has already passed a level that doesn’t even do that anymore

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.010
 exam but in the south american countries we are behind the colombia of chile and

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.110
 from argentina from uruguay and peru and everybody we were tied at the bottom

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.760
 of the neighborhood the future of this youth to continue the education that we had until

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.880
 little time is president I have an appointment here that we a 2018 was

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.560
 I am sure that I will deliver education to the floor better

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.670
 started in 2008 performed 32 years every three years

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.369
 so at the end of your first first term we will know the result already

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.220
 in these first three years I believe that we will show a connection in

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.280
 18 that was released was now in 19 and then this media that likes it so much tried

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.370
 put in your account there but the truth is the following who took 2018 were

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.420
 the young children started in the first year with meat

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.780
 had in hand when squid was president and they did it then was all the education of the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.540
 en the result is the last place in america

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.540
 from the south the results of the schools of the military colleges of the military schools

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.319
 by the very large military police in the state of goiás and

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.790
 amazon many schools that is comparable is comparable students of

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.290
 germany and if you were making pizza at that school when at the top beyond the

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.620
 military school is top in the world but it is high in this semifinal only about 70

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.299
 countries that makes the step test is in the top 10 we would now be two

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.670
 states são paulo rio de janeiro did not accept the civil and military school is

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.290
 someone has already stepped back has not yet the governors northeast side she of

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.760
 left that they didn’t want either didn’t see it because it doesn’t matter for the topic

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.250
 youth a people enlightened culture dance and the population and parents they give them

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.670
 so they dream of civic-military schools the mayor cannot be

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.510
 We are taking this initiative to several states where the governor

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.459
 no longer wants the mayor who is an assembly error and there is no time will not have

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.720
 in rio de janeiro the city of rio de janeiro will have in several cities in the

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.070
 northeast that they will have because the mayor will have it in Maranhão here the

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.840
 city ​​saint peter's believers someone watching came in contact with us

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.489
 then I'll try to tell me that sometimes even a military man there so we can go back to

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.060
 school and shouldn't anymore we will get president

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.290
 so the model is working, we want to expand quickly throughout Brazil

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.250
 but it is important that people choose their mayors and governors

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.090
 aligned with you because there are people who throw a tantrum because they didn't want to

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.109
 military civic school that the model that works so well will enter the account of

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:12.489
 sir they will not want to understand it is so complicated president the crime the

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:18.549
 that they do with the future of a generation is not to leave them far from an education of

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.970
 quality or a quality knowledge it is better to have us we

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.530
 ended due to a ceremony that was exciting with Venezuelan children

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:32.930
 and it is very clear that this godless religion, this demon thing

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.520
 which is cv socialism communism what did they do in venezuela a lot of

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.820
 children waiting for two moments today with approximately 30 children from

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:49.270
 is from venezuela who are in brazil are there and damn it and they are being

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.630
 interiorized together with his parents although the white has a child who

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.070
 the father was taking it the father gave it to relatives he came here the child did not

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:04.160
 starve at the table there is no food there look you that you like that type

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.360
 I don’t know you’re a lover of the squid, the UN was out there for the

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.340
 Chávez campaigned with a mature man, you can only see she spoke in Venezuela

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.229
 anything but democracy may be lacking and some say they have to forget squid there

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.849
 dude you can't forget these people who broke up with brazil because they are

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:28.580
 alive there we will dispute elections and 22 that this guy comes back and has no ambition

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.699
 by power so an obsession don’t rest easy

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:35.660
 I arrived better than I am, you have to vote for that person, but not that

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:41.120
 is under discussion here is the future of Brazil with this regime is that it has in

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:48.650
 venezuela that was no different from pt until recently here and speak to

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.099
 news is going to have a reason is a little bit about the increase in outfit teachers

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:56.690
 the person needs basic education according to the teachers are more or

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.370
 less ready but i am not all teachers of basic education in brazil

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.539
 also the eloy teacher who was abandoned all these years

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:10.940
 you will be responsible, your government is delivering a bigger increase

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.509
 real since fundeb was done since it was

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:20.000
 this methodology of readjusting the floor of the teacher's salary to the fund

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.500
 has a lot of student went on the streets against you last year against you

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.909
 i'm just i'm just a presidency instrument the reality the truth the

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:31.759
 money is mine I have people's money in taxes

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:36.889
 now we are returning that right ok vicente asked me now

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:40.820
 little on TV came through tortuous ways for me something

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.620
 special governor of the northeast wanting us to see we're out of games to spare

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.610
 more money for him to invest in another area because the adjustment he comes

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.300
 president of the improvement that is providing an economy like the

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:58.010
 economy is improving by increasing the collection fundeb which is the fund that the

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:03.230
 people send to states and municipalities is to pay for basic basic education

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:08.960
 for small children is the result of this general improvement in the economy

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.860
 and this money that would go to them I wanted them to want I saw the

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:18.620
 pressure because if it will veto if there is a connection between the increase in fundeb for the increase

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:24.170
 teachers' salary and more money left in the hands of this class and the

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:27.470
 you see the pressure whether or not it was the priority for the teacher, I will not

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:32.930
 veto and this increase of 12.84 percent is coming out I know it is still low in

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.500
 in relation to those what should be because they are these teachers are the teachers

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:42.950
 president heroes so it's going from 2557 to 2886 that the

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:47.900
 reference salary in most states and municipalities that readjust the entire

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:53.240
 chain is the time of 12.84 percent i will not paraphrase nine fingers but never

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:58.820
 before in history it had an increase above the real inflation that in the past had

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:03.230
 inflation people are already forgetting this the pt was going to take brazil back

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.980
 for inflation so this is news that I am very happy because it is

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.970
 a beginning president I know the commitment that just has to continue

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:16.760
 seeking improvement and readjustment and gain by basic education teacher and within

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.360
 within the fiscal responsibility for not generating the inflation crisis as it was in the

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.700
 the past is the idea because there is more to

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:27.740
 you arrive at the economy commission you remember little time when there was a

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:32.450
 announcement that the united states it is surcharged focus on aluminum the press

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:38.630
 esculhambou with me even a bunch of my friendship a certain freedom the

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:43.039
 American president resolved the matter the company wants to know how to resolve was

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:46.490
 resolve the matter I will not know the press will not know how to resolve the

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:50.420
 subject why I have to do is solve the problem

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.950
 also just a few weeks ago the united states also announced that the

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:59.440
 argentina had priority in the cd only in brazil the company also again

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.610
 gloat over ilsinho shoe over what happened in the week

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:10.070
 everything went well in brazil the american government said that the priority has passed

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:15.800
 to be Brazil even because it looks who was elected vice president in argentina the

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.950
 staff of dilma the staff of lula xavi's attention

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:23.150
 tamer de fidel castro if they think it is so i love argentina

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:26.980
 I hope that we do not work but at least

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:31.340
 it seems that it fulfilled the return of these people in politics, you know?

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:36.230
 she will have a lot of difficulty this week also yesterday I called my channel

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:42.470
 boris johnson right the prime minister of the united kingdom i must

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:48.230
 maybe I pass the he passes through here also strengthen our bonds of friendship

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:52.130
 our commercial ties after all with england the

00:09:52.130 --> 00:10:00.710
 united kingdom left the foot of them now only one will be and sovereign to do

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:04.700
 trade with the whole world practicing largely bilateralism brazil

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.030
 logically interested in this market has a lot to offer them

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:12.800
 also have something to think about us and I was very happy with the election of the oil

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.520
 johnson's is not, after all, a person very much like us when it comes to

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:23.589
 to economic liberalism and conservatism in the customs as well

00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:28.730
 speaking economics also did not register on the last day of December only milan was

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:33.350
 to 1,039 reais after December inflation was

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:39.200
 atypical it was a little bit higher than expected by us we edited another

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:45.170
 provisional measure was not only for 1,045 is real you know i know there is little in a

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:51.680
 small but you have to see that here that eternal fight of rights and duties in the

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.190
 half the clt it becomes little for those who receive and

00:10:55.190 --> 00:11:01.520
 a lot for those who really pay but are coming without inflation with responsibility

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.769
 something that nobody talks about president just like the experts

00:11:05.769 --> 00:11:11.319
 learned in ignorance said that US foreign policy would result in

00:11:11.319 --> 00:11:16.059
 nothing submission to the american empire but as they say it is only delivering

00:11:16.059 --> 00:11:19.509
 good results this proximity to the stride is generating good results in the

00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:24.939
 Brazil the policy that yours is conducting in the economy with the minister

00:11:24.939 --> 00:11:29.499
 paulo guedes is generating the lowest interest rate in the history of brazil four and

00:11:29.499 --> 00:11:33.699
 half a percent in real terms practically nothing

00:11:33.699 --> 00:11:37.569
 you are generating more than a million jobs in the first year of government I know

00:11:37.569 --> 00:11:41.559
 that for those who are unemployed it is still hard but it is dynamic this will

00:11:41.559 --> 00:11:44.920
 increase now this year growing two and a half percent real

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:49.319
 we will reduce this unemployment even further with growth

00:11:49.319 --> 00:11:53.470
 increases the salary salary we have an energy problem also from there

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:59.170
 our decision not to overcharge the sun I know the technical term is this right but

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:05.679
 not about not to tax the solar energy that produce the photovoltaic plates

00:12:05.679 --> 00:12:10.749
 we need that and that story isn’t fair you

00:12:10.749 --> 00:12:16.089
 acts home put the panels and someone he finds something or you who ends up

00:12:16.089 --> 00:12:21.819
 investing maybe from a photovoltaic plate farm tax what you

00:12:21.819 --> 00:12:26.829
 produces if you want to sell it to someone and cow and to get there you have to

00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:31.299
 have a physical means to bring electric energy to the use of third parties must

00:12:31.299 --> 00:12:34.240
 make a deal with anyone who has the gift of wiring

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.290
 how much will it be paid to take it there now who wants to generate for

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:43.689
 your company your home wanted to sell the history of distance with juices

00:12:43.689 --> 00:12:46.600
 transmission emission itself without any problem

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:51.429
 Brazil has energy to grow and we know we are lucky with a lot of

00:12:51.429 --> 00:12:56.110
 rain in brazil we can't wait to have a drought there for you and then take

00:12:56.110 --> 00:13:03.879
 providences is new is the real culture in brazil the thing that doesn’t

00:13:03.879 --> 00:13:12.339
 we had this idea of ​​making culture here a minority doesn't have to

00:13:12.339 --> 00:13:16.149
 make culture for the most we never censored used I revolted

00:13:16.149 --> 00:13:21.799
 with many films I had to suspend any concession that after all

00:13:21.799 --> 00:13:24.859
 there is no censorship now that making a book to listen to one

00:13:24.859 --> 00:13:30.199
 video one saw the movie I have several several June names on

00:13:30.199 --> 00:13:33.769
 my head I will not speak here out of respect for who across the street from

00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:38.059
 terrible screen and names are right can do but not with public money but

00:13:38.059 --> 00:13:42.410
 could pay the money i sell your house tapera money has a neighbor

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:45.619
 going to make a movie that he wants but the entire announcement

00:13:45.619 --> 00:13:50.709
 sponsorship presupposes curatorship, there is a choice, a curatorial approach

00:13:50.709 --> 00:13:54.379
 that selects the films that are suitable according to that commission

00:13:54.379 --> 00:14:00.429
 judging so nothing more than that is not censorship is curated by brazil

00:14:00.429 --> 00:14:06.019
 against the good side of cinema until when I was going to speak to make a film about the

00:14:06.019 --> 00:14:10.459
 military period to tell the truth they never left the resources if you don’t want

00:14:10.459 --> 00:14:14.869
 invest in the question of ideology make a healthy culture that you father mother has the

00:14:14.869 --> 00:14:20.179
 pleasure of watching a movie and in the theater and in the cinema

00:14:20.179 --> 00:14:23.959
 to know if your youngest children went to a cinema at the mall, I will not be

00:14:23.959 --> 00:14:28.160
 assaulted with something that doesn’t match culture with education

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:31.669
 not wanting us to know something, we’re going to launch a

00:14:31.669 --> 00:14:36.850
 public notice for cinema in late February and early March at the latest

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:42.709
 this notice will have several categories short film in animation film by

00:14:42.709 --> 00:14:48.259
 first direction at the end of 2007 before but there will also be categories about the film

00:14:48.259 --> 00:14:51.789
 about the independence of brazil is very good and films about great figures

00:14:51.789 --> 00:14:57.379
 Brazilian history so let's try to create a

00:14:57.379 --> 00:15:03.199
 healthy cinema linked to our values ​​and principles is guided with this

00:15:03.199 --> 00:15:07.429
 idea of ​​conservatism in rather than actually an art that dignifies being

00:15:07.429 --> 00:15:13.029
 human that dignifies the human condition is to tell the true story of brazil

00:15:13.029 --> 00:15:19.220
 in 1500 so far it’s okay to tell the truth the truth above

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:24.649
 of everything the truth frees up reserve and you are also programming in the square

00:15:24.649 --> 00:15:26.959
 right, the national arts award that was

00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:30.560
 so president this is going to be the biggest cultural policy of your

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:37.160
 government and dare I say it is one of the biggest policies is to encourage

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.120
 culture already advanced in the history of Brazil

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:46.760
 this is a call for tenders that will sponsor a series of categories of work

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.450
 if in these in a series of categories I’ve never heard the announcement of that size

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:54.440
 presidency will then sponsor operatic plays

00:15:54.440 --> 00:16:00.460
 painting theater than the painting exhibitions of new Brazilian painters

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:05.900
 sculpture literature new writers we will choose these new writers in the

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:10.670
 whole Brazil and launch these books these new music writers in

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:16.310
 categories popular music classical music as well and we got to pop culture and if

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.860
 is also comprises comic books

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:22.820
 so it goes from the opera to the theater through painting and even

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:26.810
 the comics what is most interesting about this announcement is

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:31.160
 that it will be distributed equally among the five regions of Brazil

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:36.800
 then the same amount of money from funds that will be allocated to the

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.610
 Southeast region that usually centralizes the issue of culture will be disputed

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:44.900
 by northeastern region it was the north and central west region south so it will have

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:49.970
 a distribution of these funds to encourage culture throughout Brazil and

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:53.690
 is the best of all this president is the following is that we are going to offer after

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:58.670
 these high quality works of art for the population with total

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:02.150
 accessibility so we have half the tickets

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:08.380
 of all opera performances in theater plays music shows will be

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:14.030
 free and books will be distributed free of charge to comics

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:20.390
 then we will have a father create quality works of art and will

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:25.220
 offering this gives opportunity to new artists from all over brazil and gives

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:30.230
 opportunity for the Brazilian public to take advantage of the high culture of

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:37.850
 high quality works of art just don't get scolded by the press

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:41.440
 I get upset but stay with the lies

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:45.740
 now interview people is that in the past

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.890
 interview renato pavan now fully the object

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:54.500
 we had one from the globe online the week that was the best congratulations globe and the title is

00:17:54.500 --> 00:18:00.200
 the following heleno convinces moorish not to fire sergio moro

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:17.960
 okay folks and this comes from the book that is being released by his team

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.500
 loves there in japan dying of hunger that the

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:27.200
 journalism was writing the book on she said I thought last year admits

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:33.710
 go around I thought now how is the business is even a journalist now they

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:40.190
 for devices affecting your thinking and raining clear evidence the evidence is

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:45.200
 personal love of god has nothing to talk about the government has nothing to talk about

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:51.710
 all the time attacking how you would like a press that sells is actually

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:56.830
 training these people is to increase this country will walk a lot to see 12 thousand just to

00:18:56.830 --> 00:19:03.070
 collecting 3 or 4 is a problem now a press is ruining the whole country

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:08.270
 with this type of misinformation, the press ends up with everyone

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:11.150
 didn't have a game of parts was an external television

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:18.470
 the good campaign is over Brazil will be difficult to return to

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:23.059
 situation we found at the moment with economics indicated a little while running the

00:19:23.059 --> 00:19:27.740
 numbers showing an interest rate never seen in the history of brazil never

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:33.800
 before seen in the history of brazil 4 and 6 percent name has no face ok look at

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:38.059
 as a federal cashier the overdraft over 5 percent was 13 to

00:19:38.059 --> 00:19:43.610
 the cashier put it up and then the central bank resolved a growth one

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:48.830
 consistent growth in investment in that flashback is that

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:53.450
 it was only in the fast consumption that would generate inflation it went to 8 percent to the

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:59.410
 total you know it but 8% 8 this is 13 i think he did three

00:19:59.410 --> 00:20:04.210
 of the five the difference is not much now the number of defaulters by

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:09.130
 the third consecutive month fell here in Brazil people are also paying empty

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:13.060
 teaching in brasília is hard some I even missed

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:16.900
 borrowed my god from heaven i've also been the loser

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:20.530
 I was not born president or born a federal deputy or alderman who was once an alderman

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:25.150
 also and the times when it comes when the guy gets complicated and has to do more

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:30.190
 a force to enter the overdraft now whoever has to enter goes to the

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:36.370
 economy box is a side at 5% and our esteemed box building

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:41.710
 pedro guimarães said it will decrease even more this percentage now

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:46.150
 the other boxes only went to 8 in common agreement with winning because the box did not

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:52.540
 put it down there I think that for the last few months there has been a little more than

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:56.050
 300 thousand new savings bank customers, personnel are migrating from a

00:20:56.050 --> 00:21:00.520
 from the bank to the control box that they saw had to decrease and with the

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:06.100
 with this policy, you know, it will force the other banks to decrease and I ask for

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:09.580
 briefcase and the house is doing it according to your understanding has not

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:15.000
 no decision no interference on the part of the chief executive here

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.270
 moment the person does the same thing usually the fei teacher can go

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:24.850
 although she present tomography done here the the hotel comes from the bottom of the sea is

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:33.520
 celebrated the flamenco tubaína and tilapia da sardinha to the brazilian championship

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:39.340

 live are already returning but delayed the return that in view of the

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.510
 changes in atmospheric conditions very quickly

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:07.450
 the staff is returning were there will participate in the date of the reopening of the

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:12.390

 I want to see if these people speak obviously having ours ahead of them

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:20.400
 our girls in maxson technology folks can do a light brief he

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:26.360
 tell what is it for what brazil is doing there ask a series of questions

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:30.870
 is how can you drink an antarctica beer a real was impressive just

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:35.910
 we fight and I know you go there go there go there all the time there is a refrigerator

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:44.059
 because it's the image of him speaking Iberian rivals is what this food like them

00:22:44.059 --> 00:22:49.080
 survive in their relationship with other people from other countries who are

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:54.059
 in the region is how does their communication what

00:22:54.059 --> 00:22:58.520
 already discovered so far with scientists are researching are true heroes

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:04.620
 really affect and with that new foundation now a lot more means to better

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:09.200
 to work they are all from now on right and Brazil really

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:14.940
 has to fulfill these prerequisites it becomes light between fame is owner

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:18.929
 of the frozen continent which is the tactic

00:23:18.929 --> 00:23:21.750
 do you have with this same as you singing the piece I want to ask question

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:28.520
 difficult you cross the river of course that without even the bathroom is a gift to 91

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:34.080
 microcrustacean that is rich in that icy region what several countries and explores

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:39.480
 even we have is entitled to the krill license but the productive sector can

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:46.140
 wanting to invest brazil currently pays for since the 80's 100 thousand dollars

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:51.720
 per year for a set up space and we do not use this capital fishing license

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.660
 will leave in the opportunity we will chase

00:23:54.660 --> 00:24:01.650
 I tried to fight only you here, I knew about the potential of fishing in part

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:05.010
 of Brazil if I knew more broadly I wouldn’t have

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:12.960
 this included the ministry of fisheries he is secretary would have kept the ministry

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:19.050
 fisheries that would have much more means to better work to make the

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:25.190
 fish in brazil fish farming really loses our trade balance

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:32.270
 despite it really is in the food and the Brazilian people is to have a proposal of

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:38.390
 take the fish caught to school we have already sent 27 trades to all

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:43.850
 governors and now we’re reinforcing it’s because we’re increasing the

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:49.460
 production of fish both from wild fishing mariculture and in the culture that

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:53.510
 it's a world model culture is growing and governors once again

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:56.750
 governors from all over brazil the secretary of agriculture and fisheries has already

00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:01.190
 officiated the gentlemen giving this option has all the support of the federal government

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:07.940
 for what purpose do we help local producers and obviously captain brazil

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:13.220
 is gaining weight is the second fattest country in the world today and the resolution

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:17.960
 of that obviously goes through healthy eating and fish with

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:22.040
 sure better than fries better than so many things that are offered

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:27.830
 according to the embrapa, he loves a hectare of lake lagoon for

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:30.980
 hectare but always without the size of the football field

00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:36.050
 according to the embrapa of the departure per year of 10 to 15 tons of tilapia the same if

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:41.810
 is in captivity in a super intensive system up to 100 tons per hectare

00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:46.970
 and we already brought technology, right, including Israel, a great model of that

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:50.960
 in small areas is with oxygenation you will see the

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.410

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:23.870
 8,500 km of Brazilian coast Lagos frequently rains 4 in Brazil

 swine in poultry all this shows that even with the potential of nature that

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:49.010
 god bless us fisheries management for many years served interests

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:52.110
 party politicians that are no longer right

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:56.780
 I would even like you to go up and down 1 minute to speak yesterday is

00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:01.200

 export to china ie the capital at three stations to export fish

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.830
 page they are the biggest fish producers

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:28.440
 in the world and the biggest fish importers in the world each ash is Chinese as in

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:33.780
 average 50 kilos of fish per year there are almost 1 billion and 400 million

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:38.820
 inhabitants a large trade for new that was importing more fish not

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:42.990
 go up more click here are helping soybeans when you did the one rightly complains

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:50.250
 with reason and faith in supply and demand in the table or by the table aa meat

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:55.380
 there are people to work beer by table, shrimp and not even in battle

00:27:55.380 --> 00:28:00.930
 there is no way a Bahian grandson is also the free personal market, Brazil has

00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:06.510
 a monstrous debt to pay last year we paid over 1 billion

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:11.970
 reais per day of interest and debt amortization with a decrease in the Selic rate

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:17.580
 forecast this year according to the central bank is we pay 110 billion less

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:23.960
 of interest rates, Brazil is right, today it had a great businessman

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:28.860
 assisting talking to me is from the mining area

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:33.180
 he is wanting to explore vanadium in piauí

00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:39.690
 Piauí is the poorest state in Brazil, right? The penultimate one is Maranhao, I think

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:43.770
 is the poorest yes it has been for three years however an environmental license from the state

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:47.430
 and does not get the governor is the curator who indicates the

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:51.660
 result in the environment, right now, a vision

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:57.940
 of these people in this campaign, okay, the method he talks about exploring the

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:02.680
 vanadium does not have any aggression to the environment but the environment secretary

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:08.830
 governor's environment does not grant this environmental license and he is about to

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:13.570
 a given up of the enterprise here after all state is ruling

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:18.460
 by petistas the more informed the people were with the lesser the power

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:23.860
 acquisitive the less instruction you have the easier it is the case of the pt to the power will

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:30.760
 pick up will buy the vote with some some welfare projects

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:35.050
 unfortunately this is a great truth there was come on let's take it and not this

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:39.220
 history is still talking when the culture of the people of the west next to the

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:42.700
 culture the Brazilian has been ill not deliberately during the last few

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:48.250
 decades and culture is the base of the homeland are retaking here president to

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:53.800
 ending this national arts award intends that this year 2020 will now be

 they brought you the sca that is only now and we all

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:44.800
 the buyer last November who just placed an order that I place an

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:51.280
 culture that didn’t destroy but that saved youth and that’s my

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:56.650
 mission and the national arts award will be a great tool that in that

00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:59.440
 salvation of the Brazilian youth of the Brazilian people

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:06.490
 through culture always one thing but the last detail that we close so much with

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:10.899
 the government of rondonia colonel marcos rocha great friend governor mouse

00:31:10.899 --> 00:31:14.320

 June 29th Fisherman's Day and we want to enter the Guinness Book as the

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:32.350
 greater distribution of fish from the esplanade of the ministries

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:37.480
 and when I talk about lapel I was raised in the valley of the ribeira there is the river ribeira de

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.659
 iguape what I think is the same thing is

00:31:40.659 --> 00:31:44.620
 known as 'the guy' summing up may be it may be because it has

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:53.440
 several takes the relative, right? and also the 2nd festival the 2nd

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:57.820
 do tambaqui festival that we did first last year always sambaqui

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:00.879
 last special just are also everything

00:32:00.879 --> 00:32:05.409
 pacopedra award for tinga my fish produced is I love tobacco

00:32:05.409 --> 00:32:10.809
 neighbor but I confess that the gentleman who likes a sardine likes a goal

00:32:10.809 --> 00:32:16.750
 of an act but manjubinha manjuba of a young girl in riba is fretilin and was a boy

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:21.429
 there was a big flood there and I, on the São Paulo side, went up each one of a zone

00:32:21.429 --> 00:32:29.769
 from the sea and through the air it’s cool a mesh of 10 and oil is makes it we can’t but

00:32:29.769 --> 00:32:34.139
 then the national army of the economy and lastly

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:41.390
 because at the door of the dawn you are to deliver this invitation is the

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:46.730
 aacute show in são josé square because the airport has continued to honor and give

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:50.540
 a look here ensures that you get a lot of main conviviality it’s very good that

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:57.680
 helps whenever possible that helps to promote that kind of activity the

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:01.610
 trade in brazil we have to encourage this here to show that these

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:05.870
 people have value but are helping by working on the issue of gas prices

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:10.330
 the price of fuel I had today with representatives from

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:15.350
 ethanol producers from the northeast with me were all over the region but a large part

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:21.800
 of them wanting direct sales and for that it depends on the exchange bed in the senate

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:32.360
 because it is to revoke a right of the national agency of the

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:39.380
 free cnp oil is a revolution cannot sell there from the plant to the gas station

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:43.900
 of fuel because it has to have an intermediary of the distributor path

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:48.440
 this we are working towards not winning since rodrigo more

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:51.620
 respect I didn't talk to davi alcolumbre Renda they are two on the agenda

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:58.340
 there and if god wants us to break this barrier there and our forecast

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:03.020
 is that the price falls at least twenty cents a liter of

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:08.090
 ethanol because it avoids what he calls a crazy ride he leaves the refinery at 100

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:16.070
 200 300 km around 300 km to stay 10 km from the plant da has not

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:19.400
 that’s right, besides you don’t have to pay more in

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:25.730
 forward what is it or who carlismo of alcohol you avoid path of the track that

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:33.230
 this bring clue helps understand less city traffic - the sentence rendered

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:38.180
 when it happens and it’s not just being there or not we also import diesel oil because

00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:44.210
 when he arrives at the port he says, right, he can't directly jettison a

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:48.230
 fuel station in the gravel there is also often a lot of fun

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:53.240
 are pipelines often to a transport car get off tank trucks because

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:59.510
 not helping this is also the beneficiary much admiration of the fuel black and

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:05.120
 an important thing in the already I think it was my piglet I want to talk no

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:11.030
 I'm going to take off me piglet if it was she is not says is a reporter the woman I

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:16.760
 I want to interfere in the state tax that the proposal that I am making to the

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:19.460
 colleague of the press eugenio of the press

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:27.200
 genius is genius jp doubt is generating stress does what i want i would like

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:31.130
 right depends on the parliament is that the icms that is

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:33.730
 a state tax

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:44.520
 it was that you rightly complain here look at us at least 30% the price of

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.670
 fuel

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:57.040
 the state now that people are drinking terrible hurt there

00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.000
 the store the governor

00:36:02.619 --> 00:36:08.799
 this is the problem there in rio de janeiro is january the price i will talk

00:36:08.799 --> 00:36:17.880
 gasoline is $ 5 anahí average at the pump is on average 30% and then threatens the 50

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:23.080
 at the refinery

00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:36.460
 having to decrease the value at the end of the line he is not that quickly answered

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:41.880
 by the by the governor who keeps charging is one and 50

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:52.349
 gasoline is right

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:59.640
 to put an end

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:09.680
 the deputy was in january will show that look at us

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:14.840
 icms is from gasoline

00:37:19.849 --> 00:37:24.000
 gonçalves was the price of the fuel is the one at the pump detonated the

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.540
 final bomb

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:34.590
 is the carrier is the governor who is the federal government

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:45.509
 you can calculate is the cane effect

00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:51.230
 the extra that burdens

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:56.840
 put the price of a liter of gasoline

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:03.050
 put it there 50

00:38:03.579 --> 00:38:08.009
 the supercomputer but that's how

00:38:09.229 --> 00:38:12.349
 governors don't
