00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.870
 Brazilian tourism company that has the trophy here at the world cup where

 we live a great world cup tourism question of bringing you here

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.280
 is an unprecedented title in the 40 years of wtm that the largest tourism fair in the world and the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.729
 Brazil was considered a country with a better business environment for the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.840
 tourism now i think that brazil really has the most attraction for the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.330
 tourism and inexplicably is a country that receives the same way that the tower

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.590
 eiffel it receives less people than the elevator no than the eiffel tower of the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.600
 that the eiffel tower lift of everything and international we don't just receive in

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.829
 6 million international tourists a year lacking management

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.969
 We need to change tourism in Brazil, first we need to change

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:37.229
 the focus of publicizing brazil the focus of publicizing brazil has always been focused

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.030
 in the caipirinha in the thong and the experience in favelas it didn’t work

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.210
 not that we don't have that because if it had worked out we would have

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.799
 continued promoting but we have a vocation for ecotourism for resources

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.659
 natural for contemplation diving for sport fishing rural tourism

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.829
 gastronomic tourism so brazil has everything you wanted one thing is not a

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.569
 simple thing i am raised in the ribeira valley already had assets there and saw the river

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:07.829
 iguape stream that came was a good person if someone didn’t like the suggestion

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.880
 the guy has money invested i'll guess that a million reais i don't know

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.650
 which is for a lot of people is a lot of money for others not so much but it made tourism

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.620
 waste that is worth of the riverside none of the waste that will do everything and

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.160
 jet ski but of registration to seven bars eldorado paulista can and descend until the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.580
 iguatu cananéia way pass from eldorado paulista

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.370
 where my city there you will see the affluent taquaril neighborhood

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:46.020
 destroying itapiúna near the water favela ahead and poranga is one thing

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.100
 phenomenal is not nominal phenomenal I have a cave the devil is

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.830
 unforgettable is a jet ski tour the jec team with which the museum side we have

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.120
 three four weeks i went down there taquari to see how

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.690
 the Indians of Pará are now alone and that Paraguay Álvaro Ribeiro

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.500
 for the love of god it’s no use that it willn’t have anything for you, it’s nothing

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.780
 marked is not right it comes from the cup here in brazil it will not work there but

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.180
 it is a phenomenal thing at that time that the river below bears the thing more clearly

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.030
 phenomenal then a whole suggestion whoever wants

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.810
 open a tourism company and maybe not even a million reais a month

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.100
 you can even get scratched and the police will go down because the road is the

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.860
 br was duplicated duplicated you go until you can stop registration

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.900
 you can record deviate to seven bars is missing logically going to have to

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.880
 to have a structure that they want is said around making structure a place for the

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.739
 inn like that trip she could take for example leave early six

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.930
 hours upstream and you can return six hours or else drive home close to

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.790
 poranga games already left water and comes to the golden for seven bars or for

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.890
 region is something that will make a profit and has a lot of fish different from my time

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.800
 all with 64 against the woman that I fished a lot of region

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.920
 basically it is the cascudo is called align at the time there

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.150
 today there is practically no more there was a little bass now has

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.160
 several fish what do you think I tried golden even going golden on jet ski

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.660
 joão doll wide wide saw stream below power letting the stream take

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.880
 until the boat playing fishing straw hat on his head a whole thing a

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.960
 suggestion if I had not been president have already retired right who

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.640
 you know I invested in that in the region say they understand it has a future making an example

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.400
 I don't know over there we have dozens of bodies and do the

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.920
 another jet ski for those who like it, you know, and have no difficulty with the project that

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.110
 there is no difficulty ok the course is a quick thing already

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.430
 we got it right with the navy commander it was red tape a lot was

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.210
 very well organized recently, at the time of many other colleagues

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.380
 carried out and you can make a tremendous jec tourism in the region in one thing

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.260
 fantastic so it was an example vale do ribeira

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.790
 we were still a businessman founded next year more boats having jesus we

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:22.310
 we are forecast to sink in this first year of the dda in these four years of our

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.670
 government around 1,200 artificial shipwreck

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:30.290
 we already have a lot of crowded spots in Brazil, we are not even going to transform Brazil

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.940
 the best country in the world for diving because we have the vocation for it

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.590
 clear and clean hot water we don't have a hurricane we don't have a tidal wave no

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.850
 we have earthquake we have a more conducive environment in the world for tourism

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:49.640
 contemplation and for nautical tourism and I mean you today a message

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.590
 here the president of bh that corresponds to 40 thousand hotels human is tacked

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.150
 cathels that you can already tell if the government a professional president

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.800
 ended today it will not end but it was the president who did the most in the history of

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.000
 Brazilian tourism he is from where I use landfill presidency the land of

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.970
 my shoulders because we face visas for tourists from various countries

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.770
 then people said ah but it will not sit for china then the result

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:24.800
 we received here is here today I just received did fifth largest agency

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.720
 travel from china just received brazil just received as biggest

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.970
 potential destination for this year and 1 year coming from china as well as the kids there

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:43.540
 in Brazil it likes to do things related to the internet it likes to

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:48.410
 entrepreneurship is already in place here the digital student ID

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.190
 if you are going to pay 30 35 it is to take the card

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:58.490
 I'm sure that the people of the union of the union of the socialist youth js

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:03.230
 everyone there that these people who stay there doing 15 20 years of college

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:08.930
 right and give it to me the academic center is breaking with this I will definitely

 to have more work, right, I’m not going to raise another 100 million

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.890
 year as well but students can now from now withdraw only

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:22.550
 but he is a zero cost digital student and now obviously this was the result of a

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:26.630
 provisional measure programmed by the Abraão Ministry of Education

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.900
 vanthauze our beginning there now this measure already has to be

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:35.540
 approved I hope that wanting to beat the deadline without being voted on now has pressure

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:43.370
 of the pc of the b inside the chamber pressure of the u now expires and then return to do the

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:48.500
 student ID being provided by these entities that charge money i

 beautiful hill turbine is the fourth death is hydroelectric in the world is the first 100%

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:47.779
 Brazilian and is a run-of-river power plant whether water is not dammed in my

00:09:47.779 --> 00:09:51.510
 opinion here I don't want to criticize this work started back there

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:58.080
 we dropped the last turbine back there it didn't start to be thought of in 1970 the

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.850
 hydroelectric beautiful monte pa but it is practically half six

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:06.360
 months a year stopped because at the time that does not play

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:11.340
 so in the rainy season only that it works and that in operation it

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:16.890
 supplies the equivalent of 7% of the total energy consumed in brazil the beautiful work

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:21.570
 alright but could be better used but anyway

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:26.250
 congratulations to everyone who participated in this fantastic piece of engineering

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:31.730
 Brazilian one more from the most humble worker to the most graduated engineer

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:36.570
 totally Brazilian technology this makes us proud and very present

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:42.810

 of this last turbine the first lady was also present the party started

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:51.900
 before this today the wedding I am this corroborates that Brazil is a

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:56.400
 country that has the largest amount of clean energy in the world of over 80% of

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.750
 our energy matrix does not come from carbon and personal curiosity only

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.240
 thing i won't go into detail question is too long

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:08.190
 it seems that we are arriving at the still makes transmission of electricity without

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:12.000
 physical means who wants is the manufacturer's personnel

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.680
 cable will find it bad so this is already beginning to be talked about in the world it seems that

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:25.920
 technology already exists a partnership of 26 countries

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.270
 these two countries are going to know we’ve already visited and even more than one

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:34.260
 okay then the transmission of

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:39.810
 energy without physical means is now technology is the world moving towards

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:46.200
 ahead but it's something that just burned you

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:51.150
 remember there when it was in august august in august the first one started to me

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:56.640
 attack the issue is overturning in the amazon in photography superposts efe

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.550
 a mess in the store I had left for me

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:03.760
 then the fires came, accusing me of everything and

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:08.430
 this collusion with the fires I said I suspected beckham accidents

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:15.910
 suspected NGOs ready the press three four days scared my son's

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:20.640
 Brazil and responsibility I don't even want to say the name here to help

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:26.290
 of the controversy the journalist in the building after it was without exercising the house well

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:31.390
 fell I see it fell yesterday has been falling also because they got evidence they got it

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:36.910
 achievements including selling material from a photographer to a very famous NGO

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:42.520
 in the world and looked at the field that are meeting people who paid for the year

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:48.700
 paid 500 thousand dollars a photograph made a burnt

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:55.420
 by the NGO hired is paid 70 million sunburned photography in addition to the

00:12:55.420 --> 00:13:01.420
 un what does it mean that it’s easier to touch fire in the bush is taking a photo filming

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:07.180
 the band to which the un discloses that was a campaign against brazil already

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:11.860
 got in touch with leonardo de caprio in toledo wherever he donates 500 thousand dollars

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:17.050
 square where a part was the people who were burning fire are always there and here

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:21.430
 worse may be collaborating there with the burning in the amazon you are not the fine is

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:28.750
 a proof is sure that with the internal and external media is propagate stories

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:34.420
 ghost liars harming brazil is true it's a war and name this one

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.750
 question is but do that president because he knows the potential that we

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.810
 we don't expect that the logically the world is seeing what I'm talking about here

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:45.040
 but not the money for a single cable the question of the agenda today not to take for

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:50.110
 fighting to preserve the environment is not for home ownership it is money at home

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:53.350
 close to the rotor circling photo of the four goalkeepers

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:57.550
 I saw it a little while ago it looks like it’s true I’m sure I’m home and seeing

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:03.430
 the luxury and gilson manual and make any envy end there when I come

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:07.780
 caviar is a certain idea of ​​life like burning fire

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:12.340
 in amazon great move touches fire in amazon discloses image my money

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:17.130
 out of nowhere there from the cable where the kaká ball zone fell

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:20.790
 for the love of god it is and the worst was the president has a french president who

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:27.510
 I had none to luxury is a picture of her starving in 1989 to disclose

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:33.030
 on an instagram baby by the photographer who had died in 2003 from a center in

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:42.020
 India and didn’t prove it during the time with me we’re waiting for the president here

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:48.260
 of this great European country to say something about the cover and these NGOs there

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:53.750
 comes now in December as you end up at the party in pernambuco you wouldn't hit a

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:10.230
 pernambuco by the federal government around 210 thousand and us 10 million is injected into

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:13.350
 economy of pernambuco in dance of the Bolsa Família

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:18.360
 folks that money is tax money and a hard-earned one is we work to

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:23.700
 fight fraud so you don't have to have new food resources

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:28.770
 we did this job and it is an effort by the federal government not having promised

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:32.820
 last year’s campaign and we’ve got the resources to pay the

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:39.750
 13th from the Bolsa Família fighting fraud so yeah I can't congratulate you

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:46.230
 congratulations the federal government already in pernambuco the 13th of the family grant not

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:55.530
 paid by the federal government and think it was worth jumping in well I will not go into

00:15:55.530 --> 00:16:04.560
 detail and then come in there will be a party today 12 years of marriage it seems that

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.730
 it was yesterday you got married yesterday 8 remains the same

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:13.610
 thing of the years or not for better and better speech

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:19.950
 then don't kiss bye the family is priceless really a

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:24.690
 well-structured family you can surrender to them is the life of

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:29.490
 people I take complain about didn’t know it was going to be difficult the bar is very heavy

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:34.260
 problems that don't end anymore, right? What is hard in the collection of ingratitude for

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:40.470
 part of some people who after they arrived after the elections to assume a

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:44.640
 public office turned against us thinking only about personal issues

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.750
 sorry we are but it's page turned let's go ahead

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:55.250
 this week we launched a new alliance party for brazil we are waiting

00:16:55.250 --> 00:17:00.270
 yesterday the tse the minister asked for a view passed to next week intention

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:05.580
 Wednesday will be judged if we can get a signature, right?

00:17:05.580 --> 00:17:11.340
 electronics is the states that gave up biometrics is working

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:15.960
 if that is what you understand it is possible i think less than a month in order to

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.020
 from which we will be able to run for the municipal elections of the year

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.630
 that comes so we are waiting for that until the

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:27.240
 At the moment, there is no one designated to speak with a loud voice to assume the role of

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:31.260
 respective is if someone is talking this is rushing there okay

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:38.460
 who wants to make a party focused on the quality of what so much quantity can

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:43.290
 I never had a municipal directory in 30 years of parliamentary life.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:47.190
 municipal directory never had a zone within the municipality of rio de janeiro

00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:51.660
 that I was councilor some even want in good faith others

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.980
 want to take over the state executive to negotiate the caption and we don't want to

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.680
 this right we don't want a party that does a

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:05.010
 that 3 of the population are screened for non-candidate candidates

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:10.260
 beat if only a friendly person publicly sympathy helps and a lot in

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.530
 brand campaign a new party we that once born

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:19.380
 there will be no television time but we want quality to indicate person x

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.740
 to be a candidate for a reef we know that it can handle the

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.820
 message and that person will have to take responsibility

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:29.220
 forming a nominate for the councilor is not who arrives at the ram

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:35.370
 the mandate one had logical makes manaus the previous life that person sometimes if

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:39.990
 it fits if I have conditions really a blessing of the councilman in relation to the

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:44.970
 event to launch not be conservative are reef she come back here a 4949

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:49.919
 rounding 50 can launch I think half plus 50 percent and seventy

00:18:49.919 --> 00:18:57.360
 candidates only 70 giving our 15 and 20 ready if we had done our dna and

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:02.400
 all right is what concentrates the most I will have a chance to make more councilors

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.950
 but the politics that discuss luck we have militancy but the most active today

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:14.039
 from all over latin america and i have no doubt that if it can't be via

00:19:14.039 --> 00:19:19.980
 We will surprise you with our militancy on the roads that are

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:24.929
 established today by law because our activism will not only run

00:19:24.929 --> 00:19:28.980
 ago but it will also demand speed in the verification of signatures

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:35.280
 this is very important for the first time after the election we have the same

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:40.409
 climate before the election new with food anger our miss brazil in brazil

00:19:40.409 --> 00:19:46.280
 200 numbers of the economy are there, thought complaining about the price of meat, the reason

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:53.640
 our travels around the world went up in the world started to buy more of us ok

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:58.919
 missing starts selling more even has to vote on the shelf unfortunately that

00:19:58.919 --> 00:20:02.549
 happens but I talked today with minister tereza cristina

00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:07.860
 three four months returns to normal because the producer

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:12.870
 the rancher is looking for a way to increase his productivity to try

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:19.020
 to meet external and internal demand is I can't now is wanting to price

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:22.830
 of frozen meat I can leave I will not do

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:28.350
 our policy is to open market logically rural producers are the ones

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.600
 ranchers are not liking what is happening

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:35.370
 also in argentina in uruguay cane producer is also happening

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:38.850
 even the same phenomenon is increasing the price I also think

00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:43.560
 is learning to eat meat because china china has also evolved in

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:48.030
 collection of the economy are much more geared towards capitalism the economy

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:53.640
 capitalist the communist regime but the economy is capitalist o china lost

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:58.530
 half of your herd of pigs focus on swine flu

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:05.820
 and there the population consumes 1 billion and 300 million inhabitants a third of

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:11.190
 population today half of the already urban population and a third of the

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:17.220
 population practically middle class the next to the middle class the consumption there

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:24.540
 now the price of meat china finds there making the transformation of the currency

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:30.600
 of that is much more expensive than here now we cannot take measures here that

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:36.150
 did not work in the place of the world oblige price table when exporting

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:39.900
 less to supply the internal market is free competition that will soon return

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:44.760
 to normal ok so I'm sorry the sister even because the

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:50.070
 price of meat o the cattle rancher he lost money in the last 15 years 16 nor

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:54.780
 a lot of money because of the refrigerators' cartel then understood the

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:58.680
 livestock activity she was flattened at the loss

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:04.020
 so the demand with in Brazil in the last times of one of a diminished

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:08.160
 so this is one of the reasons that this is happening but with 11 now

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:12.110
 with the style will return to recover the personal Brazilian herd one o

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:17.490
 congratulates the Brazilian army also our minister jucá se de freitas

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:24.450
 captain of the army for the completion of the paving of br 163 a final point in

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:30.240
 a space of approximately r 50 kilometers where every year exactly in the

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:36.710
 time to sell production there in the Midwest this highway had traffic congestion

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:43.350
 150 square kilometers the new highway all practically paralyzed with lines

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:48.720
 on behalf of trucks that lived in a morass of the van it took days to win

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:52.380
 the space 59 tacio in another seek the support of the army

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:57.390
 engineering battalions were present in this great

00:22:57.390 --> 00:23:02.970
 mission and is completing a photon now paint something in the template on

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:08.580
 curb and completed just congratulations to the Brazilian army congratulations to

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:13.620
 register earthquakes and in particular those of members of the engineering battalion of

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:18.260
 construction that participated in this work the news for you we already talked to

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:23.490
 economy we talked to the defense a soldier

00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:27.720
 engaged as the loot a second lieutenant of the second Brazilian army right

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:32.490
 an army soldier and worked from second to second world war is of

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:37.590
 $ 25 so we are fighting all right depends

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:41.010
 that will depend on parliament if it is understood that it is fair I do not want to pass

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:47.550
 for 50 reais a soldier's daily so in my opinion second tarciso

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:52.400
 in the works all over brazil approximately one thousand soldiers are on this front of

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:58.650
 alonso so help is 50 a day instead of 25 that i feel very little

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:04.410
 I think 50 already helps our battalion soldiers

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:09.540
 engineering is construction congratulations Brazilian br 163 for

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:13.200
 the forecast is completed in December and in January, right

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:19.320
 together with tarciso inaugurated we will choose a point there to stop

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:24.210
 logically one of the points is the construction site of the engineering battle after

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:31.860
 other 11 restaurant to talk to the population is to reap a feeling of what

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:37.950
 that they found this new work and and come back here then br-163 thanks to god

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:42.960
 there is end point now taison also the phone pro

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:49.140
 president luis lacalle just elected today because of the present sin

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:53.780
 hanging guard today is okay it was quite a conversation

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:59.640
 healthy friend he's a right-wing conservative has a very similar program

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:03.460
 with ours his possession is march 1st sunday

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:07.659
 see I confirmed my presence I invited or paying Brazil also said that

00:25:07.659 --> 00:25:11.350
 should be in Brazil so maybe in january february

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:16.059
 we had already started aligning what we can do to implement more

00:25:16.059 --> 00:25:21.549
 still trade relations between our country so welcome to fall and good luck

00:25:21.549 --> 00:25:26.399
 congratulations to the people of uruguay for these clean democratic elections that

00:25:26.399 --> 00:25:30.750
 choose the lackey as president of the republic

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:41.250
 there well on the 4th and 5th will be in bento gonçalves mercosul meeting and on the 5th

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:46.570
 another type of personal matter of the nautical is not only regulated it was champion now the

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:50.380
 third division is the champion now i can say i will move on to

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:56.500
 second I have already passed you will face who in the second division the

00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:04.659
 fluminense the cruise I think I will face 10 to 12 40%

00:26:04.659 --> 00:26:11.070
 I will not hope for anyone to fall but in 2009 the door and palm trees and fluminense in the

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:15.789
 fla in the river i don't know if in maracanã the arrangement will cheer for those who live for

00:26:15.789 --> 00:26:24.190
 through the press already the tricolor water there some people and all

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:30.700
 the people then invented gonçalves and as soon as you are the last day that the most

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:34.809
 important part of Mercosur on the 4th will practically have nothing

00:26:34.809 --> 00:26:39.610
 our idea is we already warned the flamengo beach i intend the flamengo and

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:45.279
 avaí maracanã logically it is right that from here to the

00:26:45.279 --> 00:26:49.149
 Flemish’s last game is every day it’s going to be every game day because on

00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:54.220
 party that after all in less than 24 hours two important titles right

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:59.140
 champion of the liberadores championship and i twisted the one from brazil it was taking a

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:03.700
 little more than 5 hope palm trees is right but congratulations to the Flemish is the

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:11.380
 team behaved better during the special after 1 hour after the start of the

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:17.240
 second round and congratulations on this one for this achievement is one more thing

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:23.700
 also in manaus the week was received by pastor samuel Câmara that the

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:29.280
 present to the convention of the assembly of god very fine his church a

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:34.170
 ceremony in a wonderful service I thank the words is addressed to my

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:42.060
 person is asking for prayers for brazil for example in order to go out and talk and also

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:45.390
 the break is always talked about, right? I added that the

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:48.510
 Brazil is a secular country that is a secular country and respects all religions is

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:54.120
 more the president the question so congratulations and thank you very much for

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:58.200
 reception pastor samuel Câmara and does not mean that because the country is secular

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:03.050
 they are anti christian is not the last issue here

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:09.450
 george george ensured from the law of order that this is a controversy

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:14.250
 with the press when a state as usual has already happened several times the genre

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:20.310
 respective the governor of the river was no longer in conditions of guarantee

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:25.320
 and security for its population he requests the public opinion

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:30.710
 this happened a lot in the past and the public plenary understood the need

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:37.470
 of one of its own personnel and material supply to combat violence for

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:42.900
 restore order the government via decree signed by georio the forces

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:50.370
 armed forces were at the forefront of this of this of this security mission in the

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:55.490
 rio de janeiro now that captain december happened

00:28:55.770 --> 00:29:02.370
 know what a captain colonel corporal and a sergeant and a soldier goes through this

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:07.760
 moment the great concern of again with life in the first place

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:12.590
 but there’s one thing that’s as important as life is freedom

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:19.410
 that is right, that is, if a governor and a public building understand that they have to

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:25.500
 send a force there right armed forces in there security personnel

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:29.180
 public many federal policemen over there in the river

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:33.860
 state aggregates military police federal police sometimes highway police

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:40.220
 federal government and these people leaving in an environment where practically the

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:44.960
 terrorism is installed only burning buses that we inside explosion

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:50.840
 is threatening the lives of innocent stone public private estates

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:56.840
 a fire on a bus touched a rifle butt and then the people of the armed forces

00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:02.960
 but those people who are there in article 144 of the constitution is not that the tst

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:10.430
 income goes there and some find the press largely think that this

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:16.090
 people have to get there with roses is not dropping kisses doing an action

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:22.510
 to face terrorists never has to come to my understanding

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:28.250
 logically has armed well equipped and they restore order as

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:33.560
 reinstate by showing those outcasts that an insignificant minority

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:41.240
 close to the population of that state that he is the authority and there in our project

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:49.730
 of law of exclusion of illegality but we put there that if the side there is

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:55.640
 hostile behavior he can get shot on this side present very clear

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:59.690
 in the project he has a rifle if he is going to do what he expects the guy takes you to

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:05.900
 take it out he sings with a rifle on a public road in jerry oh it's not a demonstration

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:11.870
 manned and demonstration of people in copacabana he demonstrating is

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:14.900
 at rodrigo de freitas lagoon dropping firecrackers

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:21.380
 none of this is gl o has no junior is not worth our exclusive project of

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:24.980
 illegality what we want is that in general it is worse

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:29.600
 that everyone will know that that emergency transaction snap

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.800
 the air force pension is going to speak and yes find for example someone with

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:39.500
 a weapon ostensibly threatening victims with a gun to his head

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:45.530
 the person can go there and take the nine that will be decorated doesn’t have to art that

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:50.270
 taken from a non-lethal weapon is because he wasn’t going to kill the victim because

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:53.560
 she was plastic will know what she calls class

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:59.720
 then that element that carries the weapon take away as many security troops or have

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:03.260
 tried against the life of innocents a side here or pension will already be able

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:08.200
 that's it but nothing that has nothing abnormal and detail

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:13.250
 it has to go through the chamber and in the Senate, if it doesn't, it didn't

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:19.250
 now i understand how the pen is the line that signs the decree is not new york

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:24.710
 it would be irresponsible of mine i sign junior will speak to humanity

00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:33.710
 for example the general commanding half a dozen colonels 10 captains 50 lieutenant 60

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:38.510
 sergeants 2 thousand welded cables a problem happens

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:40.970
 I will take care of my governor's life when it is true the

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:48.260
 sergeant corporal captain alex and who had a 21 year old guy alice kill a

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:52.850
 person was accused is but i didn't want to kill anyone but the element every day in the

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:57.140
 our project if the guy is armed with net fire on the body, he doesn't have to catch the guy

00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:59.660
 get popular from cannon i'm sure if that project

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:05.510
 approved was approved any junior signed half an hour later not only is it in

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:09.260
 house will no longer be on the street will not be carrying a gun so

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:13.250
 sensitive because our people are going to do their job this is what i'm

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:18.110
 asking for nothing more than this is this to have passed on to the media that I want

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:26.360
 contain demonstrations at the base of the bullet is not true is more misinformation by

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:31.210
 part of the media sectors i'm sure the population supports this idea

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:36.650
 after all we are tired in brazil

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:40.460
 mother joana marginality that internalized by him but I think the population has already

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:44.660
 tired of this mainstream media and the president already knows the mask has been off for a long time

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:48.290
 of this great in me we have to which country has to pass will pass

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:54.080
 by parliament if god wants because the staff but one thing is fair everything

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:59.020
 the hotel budapest right

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:06.490
 president I just want to thank you for the opportunity that your team is giving

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:11.860
 to work for my country and we are going to change and stop that country with tourism

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:16.360
 because we are the best country in the world for tourism and today with

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.450
 this provisional measure that only signed we will not stop being the country of

00:34:19.450 --> 00:34:24.310
 tourism potential to be the country of the tourist reality make it very clear

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:29.139
 because fairness is our first act it wasn’t he was touched to speak her name

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:34.960
 ok so there was a person at the embratur it was February but it was April it wasn’t

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:41.590

00:34:44.649 --> 00:34:49.540
 sponsoring with public money acts produce late 290 thousand two hundred and

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:54.340
 ninety thousand reais with a dinner in brasília fits the person left

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:59.650
 learn embratur and the grandparents and uncles came in here i just went to see the

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:02.830
 your impressive resume I hired an accordion player just like my son

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:08.140
 owner is the hamburger charter the ipad is now hitting but I didn't even want to

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:12.490
 think the change numbers that we are changing

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:16.000
 we are changing because the press in the past has changed three boys my friends

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.490

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:28.120

 digital and and made a very successful cast now the enemy no one had issues

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:42.850
 controversial baby we didn’t have a controversial issue in that weird thing, you know?

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:46.860

 questions to do with 45 alternatives a terrible terrible thing you unlearn

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.670

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:10.870
