00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240

 hi hi all right elisa carol it is today we are here this morning at cnn brasil

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.520
 exclusively with the Minister of the General Secretariat of the Presidency of the

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.260
 republic of jorge de oliveira long time give interviews to nobody then

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.289
 I thank you for having me here in your office the lack of time is the prison

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.820
 there from the activist sara winter she who represents this group of supporters of

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.440
 president jair bolsonaro to current information from the federal police that she

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.940
 was arrested and one of the reasons has to do with the attacks on ministers of the supreme

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.320
 cut as that you have been following this moment of intensification here in

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.770
 Brasilia with a protester going to the streets, even firing fireworks

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.880
 against the supreme federal court the first place good morning brazil good morning

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.050
 everyone who watches us through cnn i learned a little bit here by the very

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.420
 cnn in the forecast to pass the internet a person supporting the government of

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.670
 president bolsonaro i have no way to express about

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.230
 grounds that prison and the authority that determined it should really have

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.640
 these motivations and obviously that any democratic regime is up to

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.910
 defense and the legal instruments to counter this issue yesterday your

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.790
 and made a publication and solidarity with the supreme court

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.070
 the federal government is being the target of these more violent demonstrations, right?

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.010
 almost repeated on Sunday but that was not possible because the governor

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.810
 here in brasília the esplanade of the ministries closed, why did you take

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.370
 this stance of solidarity with the ministers of the supreme court this can be

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.890
 interpreted as a truce of the bolsonaro government with the supreme court a truce

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.390
 between powers that we’ve been talking about this conflict between the

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.590
 powers here constituted is not to be a solidarity with the supreme court

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.909
 federally alone I particularly manifested myself in

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.220
 my personal account dealing with the country's democracy actually all

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.430
 powers have to be respected equally then the same manifestation

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.080
 that I did regarding specifics against the supreme court i would like that

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.590
 the other powers were also related to the executive power for a short time

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.519
 we arrived here on the ramp of the plateau palace with an activist a person who

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:28.970
 deliberately threw a bucket of paint causing damage to public property

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.880
 also this is also an affront to power it is not that it does not extrapolate it is the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.019
 legitimate manifestation that is contrary to government actions is not the president

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.970
 legitimately elected by 57 million Brazilians respecting democracy

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.840
 respecting our electoral legislation is a president who ran for nine

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:56.120
 elections right following the established rules faithfully comes to make your

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.599
 management in the government that we are also being used not only are we not in the

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:05.460
 personal every day in our actions we have here at different times is

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.240
 actions of the president of the intention intended by both the parliament and the

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.980
 supreme court recently we had the issue of delegate alexandre ramage a

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.050
 highly qualified professional who, when appointed as an expert by the president

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.880
 to take over the directorate general of the federal police had a determination of a

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.770
 supreme court list that prevented his president from taking office yet he welcomed the

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.890
 judicial decision is rendered the nomination without effect respecting the power constituted

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:41.040
 of the supreme federal court and delegado ramalho returned to conduct the agency

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.910
 Brazilian intelligence for its qualification for its posture that comes

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.260
 developing there ahead of the management of the year now this natural is

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.480
 understandable is the government appealed that decision the government keeps things sane

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.310
 his faithful what is proposed and this is natural democracy so my

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.260
 yesterday's demonstration do not remember exclusive defense of the south

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.579
 in general it is defense of the powers of the republic of harmony that we have to

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.239
 to have the independence that we have to have and just as we respect the

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.379
 other powers we also hope that the powers also respect is the power

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:19.030
 executive respects the president-elect so that we can govern is and

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.970
 provide the population to overcome this difficult moment and accomplish that

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.930
 that the population expects a lack of mutual respect between the powers and that is

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.080
 flowing into the streets making people more and more hostile

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.000
 but we cannot generalize but it was not as it is not of powers but sometimes there

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.190
 measures that extrapolate yes so recently we did the episode here

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.750
 gives a private meeting inside the white duck of the presidency building of the

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.060
 republic a minister's region where the president made himself hard collections

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.630
 effective their ministers we are all responsible for what

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.760
 happened and the filming of what had to be just ballast

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.880
 evidence of the accusation made by the former minister is in relation to a possible

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.010
 interference by the president in federal public management, right?

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.660
 a monocratic decision the entire content of the meeting was interned that was of

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:26.420
 In my opinion, my feeling was an affront to the government, right?

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.010
 limit of what he wants, you know, if only the object of the

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.000
 empire ie the speech of the president related to the ex-minister sergio moro

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.930
 ok it was in context but when i did it ended that whole meeting

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.520
 dealing with things and reserved by several ministers here, that didn't work

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.980
 had any object of the inquiry connected and in fact the attorney general of the union has the

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.480
 taken steps is up to you to take action and the people here manifest

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.370
 as a citizen even before even starting with the understanding that there was in fact a

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.249
 excess was of the supreme court was not of a member of the

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:08.549
 what we respect disagrees and this divergence that materializes the resource is

00:06:08.549 --> 00:06:11.939
 as we have been acting is on the content of the meeting there was also a

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:16.949
 speaks of the minister of education now at the central saying that the ministers of

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:21.089
 supreme court are bums who should be arrested this has to do with

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:25.229
 government's opinion or is totally dissociated is not the form of the means of

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:31.019
 proof I think she speaks for herself is his personal opinion right

00:06:31.019 --> 00:06:37.439
 finds echo and many people in society which is common sense i'm

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:42.539
 contrary to this generalization, we cannot generalize the whole

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:46.349
 supreme cut all 11 million supreme in her that the face is plural she

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:52.649
 eh ministers are different if it’s information and it has to be better this way

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:55.829
 so be it right but that we can have fun that we can

00:06:55.829 --> 00:07:00.809
 respectfully questioning your bones using the legal ways so that we

00:07:00.809 --> 00:07:04.360
 we defend that the one of faith is I know that the president defends because

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:09.040
 the company many years is to follow the constitution the constitution has these

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.690
 rules our legislation in force in the country that if the constitution language has the

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:18.340
 its rules and we follow the relevant resources in this way, questioning us

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.730
 processes our my position particularly here is technical and I know

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:25.780
 that the president is also respecting the constitution has been respecting let's all

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.140
 these years we are here with jorge de oliveira and the minister of

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.920
 general secretary of the presidency of the republic and one of the men of the

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:38.230
 the president's confidence, you are more of a lord more than a minister of government

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:42.670
 friend has also been with the president for more than two decades is a very

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:48.460
 also more familiar that was going to the work environment, you helped to

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:54.010
 build this project by the government of jair bolsonaro that has been there for a year and

00:07:54.010 --> 00:08:00.070
 six months going on it's hard to be government because over those months the

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:04.780
 people have seen some annoyances also with the resignation of the Minister of Justice

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:09.590
 sergio moro who was an icon for the bolsonaro ita movement that also

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:15.170
 approach of the government concentrate that it was one of the flags that he preached the

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:22.120
 that would never happen, there is a change in behavioral posture from

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:27.260
 thoughts on the part of the government is difficult your government is difficult is difficult

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:32.440
 it's even very simple to explain the difficulty president was elected

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:36.800
 breaking a historical series of relationships that existed that does not fit

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.970
 here enter numerical between executive and legislative the relationship to different than

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:45.020
 it is today so we are very charged as you said 1 and a half years ago in

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:49.190
 government we have to solve problems for 30 years in the country

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:54.410
 well, the collection is very hard, it is very effective both for people who

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.680
 voted for the president as those who did not vote the president rules for

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.970
 everyone but the collection is very strong and a year and a half of government but try to resolve

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:06.440
 all the problems of the last 30 years and there are few problems so

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.790
 president has been unfairly slacked off by those who do not support and even

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:14.060
 recently by those who can understand that it has to be more

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:19.130
 harder but hitting more from the front and it’s not like that we have to

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:24.470
 understand and respect the inscriptions I speak this openly the president told me

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:28.970
 know for a long time as you said I am not a respect militant who

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:34.460
 be it is me build with the president this story that I was part of that

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:39.890
 story is kiss 98 my dad already worked with him i have a contact

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:43.090
 closer to 2003 when I went to work at the national congress

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:47.090
 I followed the trajectory of the president president alone at the national congress

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:53.160
 during the 28 years as being in there is used

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:57.210
 mainly by the parties that he fought and throughout that time the

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:01.050
 population to some extent was realizing this and most of the

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:06.090
 population in the last election delegated to the president a grant for him to

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:11.430
 can play the role of president of the republic in a very clear way

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:14.880
 we don't want what is happening today

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.920
 oh so I think seeing the 57 million Brazilians Fábio Presidente fulfill his

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.570
 promises that we legitimate for that and that’s what we’re looking for here that

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:28.410
 we have to be respected so also the powers have to respect the

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:31.440
 president of the republic has to respect the executive power also this

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.750
 delegation that our society in mine we here we are nothing no we do not

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:42.240
 we are no supreme no parliamentary deputy or senator or whoever

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:47.190
 is in the executive is nothing has the power is the people we do not have the power the power is

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:51.120
 delegate of the people to each one of us inside and the president can be

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.660
 accused of a lot of things Brasilia but one thing in particular I cannot be

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:59.610
 accused of not concluding what he promised he is no different

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:03.810
 of what he talked about in the campaign everything he always manifested himself the way

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:07.320
 as he always positioned himself he’s acting as president and this is very

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:12.000
 unclear if this is obvious even though some people disagree with some

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.860
 people have a different reading than what should occur

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:20.350
 it is but the president is legitimized by 57 million Brazilians and we have

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:23.740
 that in this moment of crisis that we live a serious health crisis where

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:28.450
 many families lost people we hope that this happens the most

00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:33.160
 son's quick but sometimes we get caught up in minor issues right

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.030
 where we have much more serious problems to face together when I

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:41.170
 speak we are the executive legislative legislative judiciary public prosecutor and court

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:46.390
 of account there the population the press has a fundamental role to supervise and

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:50.140
 charge what is not being effective but also has a fundamental role of

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:54.040
 inform the population and seriously train the opportunity that we

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.240
 can as you are doing here I thank you for that of advertising

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.950
 what we actually do and I’m very comfortable here in the government

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:09.370
 I am grateful to the president I recognize the effort he makes people do not have

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:13.750
 idea the job president point when he struggles he practically not

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:17.740
 sleep time is connected to everything that is happening

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:22.730
 I see anguish of him with the suffering of people and we here minister do not

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:26.540
 it is also no different but I also have our personal dimension, we are looking for

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:32.480
 take with him in the best possible way each of us has a profile each of

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:37.130
 we have a conduct it is important that it is so natural cover really and the

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:42.320
 people looking for adding to search for the best country even the one that supports us I trust

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:47.360
 in government with stay all of us here are wanting to do the best right and the

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.900
 criticisms are welcome suggestions are excellent we have to build a

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:57.050
 country better for everything wrong I throw the ball here so backwards anchors in are

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:00.170
 Paulo, we’re with Carol Walnut and also Zezé that you can

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:04.970
 follow that girls once again thank you for the kindness of the interview

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:09.320
 before our questioning we also have a call from brasilia igor

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.310
 gadelha also has a question for you please igor good morning minister and

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:17.700
 of him here in Brasília put him in his speech that the minister

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:21.780
 opens metal that made a good morning if I put in your speech that that criticism of

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.920
 minister Abrahão will enter the meeting it was a closed meeting only yesterday he

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.510
 went to meet some protesters here in brasilia and reiterated the criticism

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:35.700
 to the ministers, right, but in a public way, seeing that it was filmed at the same time

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:40.890
 time does not put the government in a complicated situation and does not reinforce the criticisms

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:44.820
 other powers have been doing and then the pressure that other powers have been putting out

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.450
 of the minister on account of these clashes of these criticisms how is his value

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:50.720
 this

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:57.720
 the vat thanks for the question so that's why open it has my total view

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:02.190
 freedom to express himself as he wishes and what he was there

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:09.540
 what the legislation achieved is with a libel slander if appropriate he

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.810
 be punished for it he knows it as well as each of us now

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:17.130
 recently we have to realize igor and it is important to reflect

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:22.050
 but we already had members of the judiciary or members of the power

00:14:22.050 --> 00:14:27.920
 legislature making harsh criticisms of the president of the republic comparing

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.670
 Nazi compared to hitler and tablets she likes it but we don’t want it anywhere

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:36.139
 nowhere now brother so take on smooth

00:14:36.139 --> 00:14:41.720
 he has is a confrontation that gave strong logic it manifests itself in a way

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:46.579
 much to see on social media is disapproved by one is praised by others

00:14:46.579 --> 00:14:50.540
 and democracy is that, then democracy is only valid on the one hand, I think it is not yet

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.910
 that you have to apply for everyone freedom of expression has to apply

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:57.440
 for all then so if it is natural and determined the ministers or

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:03.920
 parliamentarians make personal criticisms of the theory of government because the minister

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:09.110
 can make a personal criticism of what he feels now if he like any

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:15.290
 a huh use an untruth you want is information or more swear it is

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.899
 qualified and feeling he will answer for it like any citizen

00:15:17.899 --> 00:15:22.160
 now it cannot be purified and is going to manifest a

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.720
 opinion and here I’m not taking credit for it expressing an opinion and

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.339
 just because it is the apron apron will have to be treated differently

00:15:30.339 --> 00:15:36.029
 so any act that is can even is as I said the act of hostility of

00:15:36.029 --> 00:15:40.649
 supreme federal court was repudiated by me as by many people as

00:15:40.649 --> 00:15:46.200
 I also repudiated the act here of putting paint in the palace of the plateau there repudiating

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.410
 and in any situation like that this is not what I want for my country I have

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:54.390
 sure that the people who watch us now is nobody agrees with vandalism

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:59.310
 nobody agrees with depredation and many of these pro-democracy movements in

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:05.410
 true are the black blocs and is that they were breaking bank branches

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:12.490
 breaking stone trade depredating public and private property then

00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:16.510
 nobody wants it nobody can defend it either way or the other is

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:20.140
 the simple one so I think the goal of all of us is the constitution and the laws in

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:27.850
 force in the country of education speaking a curse a swearing right then what causes

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:36.549
 strangeness letter a and it doesn't look like he says i'm

00:16:36.549 --> 00:16:39.840
 afraid of Bethlehem in the best-selling comeback

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:44.100
 and not each one of us speaks for myself I do not speak here I will not see there is no speech

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:49.320
 by the government the president of the republic is I speak for my ministry I speak for

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:53.520
 because you are a Brazilian citizen like anyone, just like the beginning, open the

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:57.870
 beginning the work plays a role in front of the ministry of education is a job

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:02.730
 very difficult and he tries very hard to correct a problem.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:07.200
 series of problems that are historical right and that’s why he has the

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.190
 natural confrontations typical of democracy, governments are in fact

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:15.810
 transient so because in a while the population decided I liked the

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:21.150
 government did not like the government or elect the other this is how it works now is the

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:26.400
 the president speaks for the government, you know, the president speaks for the government and it's simple

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:30.630
 so a word in the mouth of the expletive question we have to stop at

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:39.659
 here, this awakening is the protocol seam is swearing of the

00:17:39.659 --> 00:17:44.460
 culture of the Brazilian president and is expressed in this way with most of

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:47.970
 of people are watching them now speak your day to day on your on your

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:52.049
 environments but was in the reserved environment the president spoke the bad words

00:17:52.049 --> 00:17:57.210
 that are natural there, right, maybe our formal heart as it happened in

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:01.799
 other times it did not recently broadcast a meeting of ministers as

00:18:01.799 --> 00:18:06.179
 as a sign of accountability to give opportunity to each melissa to speak there of the

00:18:06.179 --> 00:18:09.570
 generalization of his ministry that was dealing with video color and

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:15.179
 logically that in that condition that you tried to respect it is more of a protocol

00:18:15.179 --> 00:18:19.470
 but on a daily basis the situation of each one of us is watching now that you know

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:23.549
 how are family fights or the quickest conversations over there in football and

00:18:23.549 --> 00:18:29.549
 everything is natural the president is not is not no no I do not believe passed that he is me

00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:34.169
 I prefer his authenticity much more than the poly since words from people who

00:18:34.169 --> 00:18:38.500
 took the country where we didn’t get to mine also has the shape of it if

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:42.580
 expressing has to be respected so it is a disapproval of what he

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.570
 does you know nobody is perfect he is not perfect i am not perfect the bowl

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:51.280
 that my friend is not perfect you there right igor who is a friend also that

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.690
 we already talked I start the opportunity each of us has our imperfections

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:59.380
 now because he is a minister of state he cannot go wrong he cannot

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:02.680
 eventually i'm not even saying it's a mistake i'm not talking like this i'm

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:05.770
 saying that it has road network is equal to any of us we're

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:10.180
 here to serve the people in the best possible way than in what we need

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:13.960
 repair we are available we have sufficient humility we do not have

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:17.950
 compromise with the error and go back to correct try to do better this is the

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:21.670
 our commitment is only if we continue to take advantage of it

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:25.690
 here our schedule we always have a big debate on the new day today

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:29.170
 with a little delay because of this exclusive interview that the

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:32.800
 Minister of the General Secretariat of the Presidency Jorge Oliveira

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:36.559
 moment for us and mix one more question now from yuri pitta

00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:42.080
 hi free minister good morning thank you for being with us here at cnn you spoke

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:47.720
 now little about the disclosure is practically in full except for the

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:51.649
 mentions to other countries of that April twenty-second meeting but at that

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:55.940
 minister celso de mello's decision four times in the decision says no

00:19:55.940 --> 00:20:00.409
 was aware of the secret classification of that meeting that was only

00:20:00.409 --> 00:20:05.779
 taken by the government on the 8th of May, that is to say 16 days after the

00:20:05.779 --> 00:20:09.080
 April twenty-second meeting itself why was there such a delay in

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.950
 classification of the meeting as secret and why does the minister of supreme

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:18.070
 federal court was not informed about this classification

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:23.960
 and it is in fact there was no delay document will be classified forever

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:30.470
 it is as soon as the meeting ended there I started the glue to dry now

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:36.010
 independent of the supreme court, minister celso de mello is aware that the

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:41.900
 that recording was classified, that is, a tin is a reserved character

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:47.900
 right of the treaty here in the presidency the shampoo content didn’t hold any

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:52.130
 relationship with the empire bodies this is the divergence the inquiry he had a

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:56.440
 purpose that was to confront a statement by the ex-minister sergio moro

00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.280
 everything else had no relevance that the empire

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.610
 good so that's enough I didn't even need to formally have

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:07.960
 classification a reserved environment within the presidency of the republic he

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.020
 dealing with matters was being dealt with there many things are

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:15.130
 constructions each minister of collaboration each brings an approach on their

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:20.080
 folder is treats sensitive themes eventually are themes that are in

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:26.920
 construction this can influence the stock market

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.430
 influencing the dollar can influence a number of things that are still at

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:34.900
 construction now independent of that were speak the place where we ministers

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:39.700
 meeting president making effective collections in a slightly more

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:43.870
 vehement than usual usually the nodes have a very good climate so they

00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:48.310
 are very prepared here but on that special day the president had a

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:52.150
 more affective certainty collection and each minister about his perspective of this

00:21:52.150 --> 00:21:56.830
 contribution in the same tone respecting the law obviously what what was possible

00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:02.570
 and in fact the non-conformity is a repair that is done and that

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:08.050
 attorney general of the union diligently expressed in the case file is

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:14.180
 there was a speech exhibition that had no connection with the object of the empire

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:18.500
 none of us like that i wanted a very important learning that we

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.890
 has been since childhood I thank my parents for that is why we shouldn't

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:26.960
 do with people what you wouldn’t like them to do with us this is

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.650
 basic learning is good for anything, you know, so we just need

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:35.510
 reverse and if it was the other way around then

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:41.030
 and if we’re going to imagine that the federal police having the party more than a series

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:45.560
 information should advertise something beyond what was demanded

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:50.600
 investigate then a simple reflection i think those those learned

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.960
 that we have our personal life they also reflect in our life

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:57.830
 right do not do with others what we would not like

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:02.690
 do with us this is simple recently even in a meeting with

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:06.230
 businessmen there inside the supreme federal court advising

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:11.450
 the presidency's communication transmitted, right, he put film equipment there and the

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:17.120
 minister toffoli supreme court president didn't even know it was being recorded

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.150
 right, the meeting was being broadcast I was not present there

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:25.100
 in that meeting I don't know if the start itself is not necessary if he

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:30.560
 consented it will not be contrary to that exhibition the fact is that it was being done

00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:35.520
 an ostentatious recording and I wonder if he hadn't confused

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:40.800
 the transmission would not have asked for it not to do it, it is and it was a journey that the

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:44.550
 president went with some businessmen was not present there but I did not see any

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:49.860
 like there was no sensitivity it was just the speech of the president of the

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:55.200
 people who followed up taking a lawsuit to the federal supreme court then

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:59.160
 there for the very end of our interview we saw that the supreme court

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:06.720
 federal government has not confirmed a kind of moderating power the armed forces that

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:11.090
 I think of this discussion of a possible military intervention to

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:16.320
 possibility of that and just to complete the sound is the new minister of

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:20.730
 supreme federal court for this vacancy that will be opened soon i

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:25.200
 raised the issue of the moderating power of the armed forces is the manifestation of the

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:30.780
 minister is precise and says what the constitution already openly says its

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:34.740
 Our country’s weapons are a source of pride for every Brazilian regardless of

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.510
 who supports and armed between fulfilled a role

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:41.440
 institutionally in a very significant way in we have navy

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:46.750
 Brazilian air force army that plays a fantastic role in every corner

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:51.190
 of our country so in the greatest difficulties that will be there in a

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:55.180
 military of the armed forces is reaching out right as is the motto of the army arm

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:59.380
 strong helping hand so it is a source of pride for all of us regardless of

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:03.460
 government and the constitutional role and instruction of the armed forces is very

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:07.870
 of course and they’ve been doing it very very effectively and I’m sure that

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:12.790
 are not going to deviate from that is not what we all struggle to have a regime

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:17.050
 democratic country president bolsonaro as he said the Brazilian he could

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:21.790
 be accusing of anything less than being an undemocratic person and

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:27.250
 disputed nine elections respecting all the rules came to power legitimately

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:32.200
 in voting without any kind of interference so your armed forces fulfill that role

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:38.120
 that the bright is the manifestation of the mini and then it needs just as it was needed

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.720
 demonstration that made the president the vice president and the minister of defense

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:45.470
 general fernando so here in the palace we have generals with general heleno

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:49.040
 general branches is the new payment in the government we are at the very high start

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.750
 in that landmarks bridges also of the air force minister tarcísio they are worth are

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:59.420
 friends since the time of military school for the ax group of assis has a lot

00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:03.470
 is very proud here of the position of the work that they make the pepper and the

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:08.720
 military today add to the country adds to the government contributing what they

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:13.550
 can do it if in case he is doing a transitional job ahead of

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:17.810
 ministry of health important ministry that has been overcoming

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:21.950
 difficulties doing an excellent job so we no longer have the situation

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:25.790
 civil society as if there were in the military society in parallel society

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:30.350
 we build one government together, the proof of that we have here today

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:35.520
 military of the three armed forces i'm a military police officer here with a lot

00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.960
 and it represents a measure the state police from all over brazil we have

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:44.160
 federal civilian highway police officers in all areas of government and

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.670
 as soon as we add up as soon as we build a better society and that we don't

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:52.110
 can we have that as the brazilian people and this is a positive speech

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:56.580
 for example, from the adventurous minister the people of Brasilia, only we have to

00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:01.140
 unite to overcome difficulties divergences are important criticisms

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:05.700
 they are important they make us have women make us reflect on make them improve that

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:09.630
 that we do but we have to unite us as the Brazilian people and say that the

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:16.650
 need people now became minister of justice now the discussion

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:23.250
 the public security ministry I know that the new one of the new portfolio, right, but also

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:28.500
 there is the possibility of you being a name for the vacancy behind the scenes

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:33.240
 good federal supreme court minister if i count on the trust of the

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.530
 president there bolsonaro will you

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:40.450
 the bread of posts I am at the disposal of the president if he wants because he

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:46.630
 need is I have a history with him for some years has been following since

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:51.280
 the time of the greatest difficulties and today with other difficulties here in the government

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:57.520
 is when in relation to the public security ministry as a military policeman

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:01.480
 as someone egressed from an extension of public security defended

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.420
 yes, as it already publicly defends the creation of the Ministry of Security
