 extremely important fishing right fishing in brazil when we pass in we grow

 I think that around 10 percent we started to encourage fish farming

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:58.570
 in Brazil shrimp farming also if you have shrimp farming it has a

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.990

 late until sad 2.25 percent some days that will go down even more so

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.979

 of the transposition of san francisco you have to say will he has I we

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:16.710
 we have received guidance from you that we should not leave any work stopped is

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.440
 that was initiated in previous administrations and mainly in the titans and

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.699
 water resources so important to provide security to the northeastern population of the

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:33.449
 semi-arid then the arrival of the waters from são francisco to ceará is the reason for

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:38.490
 celebration for all Brazilians this is a secular dream was spoken by

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.720
 first time by dom pedro according to the work began more than 15 years ago

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.159
 idea was if it was going to end there in just five years a series of

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:52.449
 problems from poor design to the question of

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:57.909
 resource allocation is almost three times the value that was thought

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:03.009
 previously we have invested in its administration almost two billion

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:08.079
 we arrived in Ceará and she until the second half of next year we will

00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:11.769
 conclude with rio grande do norte we integrate four northeastern states

00:06:11.769 --> 00:06:16.479
 bringing to the northeastern semi-arid, I think this trail of prosperity that

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:21.519
 water security we completely live the work until 22 not this

00:06:21.519 --> 00:06:28.809
 should 21 21 21 we should finish the work there people are drowning in this is it

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:33.999
 we will see irrigated perimeters yesterday adductors but the work of san francisco a

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:37.809
 we conclude in the second half of next year we have here in pernambuco

00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:45.459
 the correction of fruit production this will also enhance fruit production in the

00:06:45.459 --> 00:06:48.260
 northeastern hinterland all over there in the cariri region

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:54.260
 to do about the taste of the fruit in lg features that work is allowing that

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.760
 a series of irrigated perimeters that bring agriculture is irrigated which is a

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.170
 high value-added agriculture to clean up the semi-arid region is to be

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:08.660
 established in addition to treated water on the tap of people who do not have water

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:13.070
 In fact, the question of sanitation landmarks is dealt with, right?

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:18.050
 problem quickly underway we are there dealing for example with

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.040
 water security of 4 and a half million people who live in the region

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.630
 metropolitan fortress with the arrival of the waters I already had their integration

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:31.520
 the water belt, right? We are talking about the doctorate editor

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:36.340
 in paraíba there are more than 400 thousand people safely on tap

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:41.330
 adductor of agreste there in pernambuco finally if it is a fantastic work of

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.890
 ethical security for that whole region and sanitation we have to celebrate the

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.240
 brazil has to celebrate the president why

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:54.389
 and finally, since 2016, the discussion of this

00:07:54.389 --> 00:08:00.150
 milestone we have 100 million people without sewage treatment coverage 35

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:05.009
 millions still without treated water and now the challenge of universalizing this video

00:08:05.009 --> 00:08:09.360
 so important will count on the support of the private initiative because we have

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:16.199
 now legal certainty predictability and attraction to bring from 500 to 700

00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:20.160
 billions of reais of investment then generate millions of jobs an bring

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.360
 especially health and productivity for the Brazilian population so we are all

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:37.680

 irrigated also in the northern region of minas so we are doing a

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:33.190

 fisherman's day 29 the day of the fisherman san pedro's day is also there we did the

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:07.160
 digital board map what happened to the Brazilian fish production through the

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:12.230
 boats huh artisanal fishermen needed to be manual huh so anger weight

00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:17.840
 cool look is only going to be manually on sheets and taken to the superintendence and

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.620
 many times that data was lost and now we are discarding the

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:25.460
 Brazilian fisheries statistics that will only strengthen the security of our

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:30.320
 brazil and productivity and also logically providing more service

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.340
 Brazilian citizen does not need to travel anymore he can do this from

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:38.540
 your own home from your company from your amateur fishing portfolio office that

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:43.570
 that's it the captain is the second version of the cool is

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:47.800
 the second version of the amateur fishing license, right, with more functionality with

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:52.900
 automatic debit there on the site so the amateur fisherman the sport fisherman

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.680
 Brazilian can enter the website of the Ministry of Agriculture and take his

00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:02.380
 digital fishing card without complication he even print paid the

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:08.500
 payment slip and automatic payment is less bureaucratic right then we are

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:14.860
 in contact with the navy also front to facilitate the withdrawal of the motorcycle license

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:19.870
 in the last one the person who likes to ride a jet is very complicated for many hours

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:25.920
 of practice and there are countries that you arrive at, right and sign a term of responsibility

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:31.300
 a few minutes you learn to move your body jesc will pass it there if we

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:36.340
 to be able to do it at least will help a lot in tourism here in Brazil

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.410
 I have been saying Vale do Ribeira, my gel table over there, right?

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:44.750

 tourism is money for the region everything is better now to be less bureaucratic

00:13:05.209 --> 00:13:11.060
 a lot like himself here is said now the jorge safe ran no map of

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.600

 pedro's last participation here emergency aid by yes sir

00:18:21.279 --> 00:18:27.700
 announced this week the fourth and fifth installment of emergency aid we

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:32.840
 we’re still finalizing the calendar that’s coming soon from you

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:40.970
 to prove ia is very important president until the 600 is actually 65

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:47.120
 million people and we are paying just over 50 billion reais so

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:52.789
 it's not even by average mind people are gaining 900 reals because

00:18:52.789 --> 00:19:00.409
 family books have $ 1200 so it's not just 600 on average I think the

00:19:00.409 --> 00:19:06.049
 benefits are the 900 reals is a big help and the federal savings bank i

00:19:06.049 --> 00:19:10.640
 I can say that you in several cities, especially in the interior of the

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:16.309
 brazil north northeast special has a big improvement in the economy exactly

00:19:16.309 --> 00:19:20.630
 because you just had a difficult mirror for us to sign the decree this week

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:25.460
 the mayor and the senate are present in two more installments of 600

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:30.260
 that will cover the month of July and August is that it cannot continue with

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.850
 a long time as Pedro said here from the box

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:38.940
 50 billion a month I am not money left over we are indebted to

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:43.170
 that’s our very high external debt and we appeal to your

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:47.600
 governors and mayors that more and more logically corresponds

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:53.190
 responsibility that you all have is start to open the trade and go back

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:58.260
 economy is for us to work, so two more installments are five

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:03.510

 right and every time I say that I’m going somewhere with some people or I’m

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:49.010
 massacred there in one by a television network you know what it is because it was

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:55.070
 without a mask it's okay remember that today, July 2nd is the national day of the fire fighter

00:25:55.070 --> 00:26:02.480

 is being done right with the participation of the local mayor

00:26:17.779 --> 00:26:25.969
 hello fake news skin is there in the senate is coming back highlights I mean the

00:26:25.969 --> 00:26:30.770
 everyone here that the mayor himself said that

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:37.580
 and the bill approved in the senate I undergo changes in the chamber and it is always up to me

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:43.490
 right is the possibility of a veto this is natural and the parliament wind keeps

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:49.000
 some time old you're natural ok, of course you don't know my position

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:54.710
 extremely favorable to the total freedom of the media, even those traditional

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:58.970
 hit me all the time no problem can keep hitting christmas

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:02.330
 hitting so much I'm just growing keep hitting without a problem and now

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:08.390
 we cannot admit censorship here for the love of god and even more just curiosity

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:12.890
 right curiosity I have an analysis here I will not give it to another this here for the

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:18.950
 Wednesdays where facebook google twitter whatsapp makes an opinion contrary to this

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:27.170
 pl and I say more right don't look too tec were 44 senators who voted there

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:30.780
 favorable personal project is still being beaten

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:36.480
 and if today I talked to the janitor who voted in favor and he apologized he spoke

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:41.190
 who was going to see the mistakes is that it was the electronic vote, right and it went wrong again

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:44.940
 if you have a vehicle maybe if the project is good enough

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:49.320
 people who are triggered now have to arrive as they did so far we

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:54.630
 there is no way not to stop seeing it and even more and then passing the camera with the

00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:59.670
 difficult but if it passes it is how we can publish the project, right though I

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:04.260
 I have 15 days to sanction or veto and then people will be in the tire little will be

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:09.510
 which article should be vetoed and should not be vetoed because after all and it was

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:12.990
 liberated the expression is spoken about democracy a lot of people do democracy of

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:17.910
 lip service but approves a project that restricts freedom of the press that does not

00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:25.110
 you can admit that there i doubt which citizen of brazil is most criticized in

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:29.490
 internet than I wake up nickname a lot of stuff if I feel

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:36.760
 harmed can I go is slander training which is more Julia

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:42.520
 Okay, now I never wanted to censor media to protect myself from mine.

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:48.040
 When you talk about democracy, one thing you exercise is another.

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:52.510
 open here is heavy there augusto nunes is maria vitor brauer wires already any

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:56.290
 question to the people at the table is certain I feel comfortable that we

00:28:56.290 --> 00:29:02.830
 boot here on the sound here answer for you we will continue today there were several

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:07.030
 this a bill also that talked about the mandatory use of mass

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:11.650
 even inside the house and sheep nobody will be in your house is for you

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:15.880
 show myself here I could be fined now because I'm without a mask

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:22.030
 even the people of her are also just thinking of respecting us pandemics we

00:29:22.030 --> 00:29:27.610
 we regret the dead but I made it very clear, you know, the look down story of

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:34.400
 staying at home the goal was for hospitals to prepare themselves with beds

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:38.480
 I use respirators to care for those who get infected there and need

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:43.490
 I do not know can be questions with this person who

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:48.620
 has lost his life for lack of use or lack of respirator so the goal

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:54.260
 it is not to leave the person like this, if the infection is what everybody is

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:58.850
 know that sooner or later people will contract the virus, right?

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:02.930
 goal was to prevent us from queuing and someone vs showing up for lack of

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:09.320
 care for what it looks like with coast didn’t happen ok now the

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:13.760
 big problem if we have been criticized a lot back there was the destruction of

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:18.410
 jobs i don't know how many millions of people lost their job in brazil we

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:24.710
 we know that the informal 38 million people or the income was zero or was

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:30.260
 reduced to practically aoi told you that the countries of south america and

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:33.330
 inform eighty percent of your power

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:38.940
 so the problem is that our page dealt with the back but these

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:43.790
 measures to close trade to prevent people from going to the beach, among other measures

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:49.290
 such measures fell to the governors and mayors according to the supreme court

00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:53.700
 federal ours just almost just send money to states and

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:58.290
 municipalities and we send a lot of resources to states and municipalities to compensate

00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:03.630
 the loss of revenue from the state, which is the icms, a large part, right, the municipalities and

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:07.110
 normal shiny cells, but it should brush today, I’m not mistaken after

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:13.080
 14 million today 13 14 million only municipalities are going to municipalities in the

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:18.870
 brazil 21 pedro matilde something is wrong

00:31:18.870 --> 00:31:24.540
 you pedro arrived here continue here to greet here the initiative of

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:28.890
 commander of the air force lieutenant-brigadier-of-the-air see a lot that

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:35.130
 offered these commercial airlines the parking lots

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:40.410
 of the air base of brazil so that planes from the da da gol da azul would go there and

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:46.530
 didn’t have to spend on parking is that it exists at the airport

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:50.640
 out there the savings forecast and six months for this company with 18 million

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:56.400
 this helps this company that already has difficulties, I believe that

00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:02.490
 in the order of almost ninety percent of flights were canceled in brazil so

00:32:02.490 --> 00:32:07.110
 this bus is down there so this measure there from our commander

00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:12.720
 logic here brought there to offer the courtyards of the base was ours so that if the

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:19.660
 people would stay there at zero cost well in some speech is concerned with the

00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:23.320
 entrepreneur a person who break the airline here will have pilot

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:30.430
 fired flight attendant companies that are shopkeepers hello hello hello brazil break

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:36.160
 everything breaks everything and and another important thing here the board

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:40.240
 national high energy policy with you special northeast conservation and

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.900
 energy policy has established guidelines for methanol to be

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:47.770
 sold from the plants directly to the fuel tank what happens

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:53.220
 nowadays ethanol became a tourist he left the plant here where 300 for him

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:58.840
 car plays play denotes lack for the post here on the side he was 600 km and

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:03.520
 now there are still some more measures to be taken so that ethanol can be

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:07.360
 sold directly from the plant to the gas station that's right hopefully

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:11.500
 that eliminated the state I think that in the big ones it will continue sure it goes to

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.230
 decrease the price of corn ethanol in gasoline is also in the gazette is there

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:18.550

 some readers did not accept the students from the schools to enter

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:14.450
 at the university via sisu to end this problem and leave the work that the great

 young pan there are a number of important reforms include changes and milestones

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:34.490
 regulatory issues, right, the railroad issue, the gas issue, right, the issue of the gas itself

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:39.890
 tax reform undoubtedly a major challenge yet to come is the

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:46.100
 minister paulo guedes is at the head of this process this change in our

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:50.870
 economy and I believe it is more important at this point as long as there are

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:57.320
 this synergy with parliament would change or simplify our

00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:01.239
 good tax legislation wait for it is right there I don't know

00:41:01.239 --> 00:41:05.199

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:21.859
 professional caregiver I already had several rescues by chance I say this

00:41:21.859 --> 00:41:27.440
 2016/2017 nothing ended I was with this guy here on the beach of Barra da Tijuca

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:35.670
 300 now second lens mozart pereira lieutenant of the Brazilian army of

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:42.150
 and it was there at the 4th rank in the direction of the sheraton hotel and it was an end

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:47.310
 year I think she did kill or in the group and it always happens to me these

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:52.470
 things right I do good here is paid your debts 2000 Japanese will go

 plate for tijuca good morning is about 15 years old 16 on that other

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:15.780
 we took it out ok so you can here have an idea to build manufacture what the

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:22.470
 fire saw already uses in rio de janeiro at night is not the modbox one is my taste of

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:30.780
 divide my building's cube prize not the rectangle a rectangular figure of

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:35.670
 neoprene with a high on each side that serves for you I save lives until the

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:41.069
 end of the buoy is good and I doubt it for the price I planned I will kick here

00:42:41.069 --> 00:42:46.799
 right, but even in the savannah, it would be enough for us to do it there, it’s even a federal sin

00:42:46.799 --> 00:42:51.720
 my wife was admiring someone opening a company and would do that there perfume coming

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:57.000
 the tax burden is august ask for something that I could see by without dragging has

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.520
 some luca had to sell for 300 I gave up

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:06.400
 is the big problem in brazil you are tax burden is bureaucracy and you

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:12.880
 give up on investing is not to say until you venture into a business that after

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:18.190
 that breaking becomes more difficult as a rule you are free from the pending issues

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:23.080
 debts so there is something else but then this is what we should do to make life easier

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:28.190
 who wants to undertake in brazil the other question this bye

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:39.410
 and says he uses it I thought it is and it was fundamental among other reasons

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:43.470
 why and then

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:52.810
 and then the socials are

00:43:52.810 --> 00:43:56.280
 what's up

00:43:56.970 --> 00:44:03.920
 the internet and

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:15.200
 and went away you use good night you too how was work is good night

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:19.130
 you also thanks there for the card in my life I think this is a

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:24.800
 important moment for a country is we are living there the moment when the

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:31.430
 people try to solve problems through a bill that prevents

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:36.800
 the free demonstration is of other people like the president of course

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:42.740
 kept the proper proportions I was practically destroyed or by fake

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:48.320
 news right why would he conduct labor reform as a deputy in the chamber

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:54.710
 federal government and when he was a candidate for my re-publication I practically had no way of

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:58.010
 defend myself in my status that has accused of subtracting rights from

00:44:58.010 --> 00:45:02.060
 workers when all mission worker rights preserved the

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:08.640
 article 7 34 items of the constitution are brazilian and even that i'm missouri

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:15.000
 is against the press against the free demonstration of whoever I am

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:22.470
 I learned that it is a secret, right? It is to the adversary, he is extremely

00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:28.349
 healthy it is a demonstration of the vitality of institutions like all

00:45:28.349 --> 00:45:36.329
 I’m upset in resignation I don’t agree with a certain opinion

00:45:36.329 --> 00:45:41.309
 suitable field for the to contradict and they get down my voice my word

00:45:41.309 --> 00:45:46.799
 or recurring is also to use the same instrument that allows social or some

00:45:46.799 --> 00:45:57.210
 another game in the press we voted for a small labor reform and the minister

00:45:57.210 --> 00:46:01.800
 francisco dornelles present fernanda ricardo i did favor

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:06.920
 the internet did not have what we have today there was no zap

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:14.839
 me and me and very flaming we are devastated on the internet because he said

00:46:14.839 --> 00:46:20.270
 that we came back to finish it must be having its guarantee now the same that

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:25.650
 if this pregnant woman two you to end and there is no way to end this thing

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:29.890
 there is no constancy company can end up with

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:36.010
 to use because this is it, you could install it, ok, among many others

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:45.520
 things and the anticipated 13th is the certainty of a

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:54.190
 thing that the boss butchered with this with this bill i wanted that

00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:59.560
 make a labor reform but the left and the left completed in

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:05.260
 schools use used many with the dental roundabout or do-a-poster pasted on the street there

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:08.620
 in rio de janeiro the first one to appear in the portrait was i connected the

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:14.530
 surviving world 2002 afterwards we had with fernando henrique 2017 right then already

00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:19.840
 2017 ahead we have after having been in 2017 we went back to work for the week

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:24.550
 that I came back again favorable here I had 500 thousand voices was the rappi of voting

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:29.560
 mine from rio de janeiro but the best was complaining because i went was there i stayed

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:33.640
 there from the president and the husband suffered a lot not from ours because the left the

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:37.400
 union saying exactly the same thing that will end guarantee fund

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:45.220
 the third with anyway with all fingers now that's not why i will want

00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:50.030
 censor social media using the rest we run the other respect that

00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:55.940
 has parliament is the democratic game if it passes in bed coming to me the

00:47:55.940 --> 00:48:00.950
 project I will make a popular consultation what should be vetoed or not and we will

00:48:00.950 --> 00:48:04.390
 come in the afternoon because parliament can understand that the wind has to be brought down

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:09.680
 this is part of the rule of the game now in the senate it passed a little close to it passed with

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:15.860
 44 voice would be the most simple right now you can overturn the veto and you have to have 41

00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:22.670
 votes right no and I'm 44 passed the project already has a senator who said that you can see ok

00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:30.200
 he will keep the veto be more 2 3 + 3 + 3 senator to resolve to return to keep

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:36.530
 beto to see what we see ok the veto will not be maintained so call me

00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:41.130
 depend on me not hi total social media cruise

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:46.320
 that are secreted no one suffers more than I doubt that during the campaign

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:52.110
 look I was called a racist homophobic fascist chenofago doesn't like

00:48:52.110 --> 00:48:58.560
 northeastern for everything over me ok pt one of your two inspections a

00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:04.710
 a girl appears on the television with a swastika marked on her belly, right, and that of the pt

00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:09.720
 said it was good the nose that did that after you want a skill and coming

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:14.550
 that I she herself made she allowed it to be done by the depth of the cuts

00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:20.100
 300 fake news ok we survived all of that and more and more the population

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:25.680
 is getting it right and immediately knows what fake news is and

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:30.270
 all right now i'm being judged by several lawsuits asking for the impeachment of

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:34.860
 the plate doesn’t have this, this is what the next one looks at, just say that the most

00:49:34.860 --> 00:49:42.340
 tricky is that I would have is driven is driven the zap in

00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:46.810
 mass on the occasion of the elections i ask you daughter do you receive the

00:49:46.810 --> 00:49:53.530
 your phone there is a zap from someone you know who had to do with the

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:57.820
 elections 2018 that made you change your vote for me to haddad wow that I

00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:02.410
 possible and I didn’t receive it I think no one here received it and I’m resolving

00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:07.540
 an accusation like that is a more serious accusation just hunting the plate

00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:12.350
 bolsonaro mourão and was filed 7-0 in the other

00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:19.220
 accusation in the tse that I would have sponsored billboards throughout Brazil in addition to

00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:25.040
 we collected r $ 4000000 spent 22 returned to the non party

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:30.500
 the tc is obliged to discuss this matter and put it on, but these are things that

00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:33.920
 we will always worry about any lawsuit against us, you know

00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:40.970
 which is an electoral court and sometimes some other minister who even a vote that

00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:44.870
 give a political vote, right? We know it can't be like that, but not a human being

00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:49.130
 I believe in absolution in the filing of this whole process until it is even for the

00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:55.800
 quality of the boys who are there but it's fake news just get my phone here

00:50:55.800 --> 00:51:00.600
 what I get from a joke e-mail from everyone, even from myself is not in

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:05.550
 okay comic I wanted to be some here but I will not seek not to be able to warn here

00:51:05.550 --> 00:51:10.500
 this is part of the folklore, it has a joke on me, even if I die laughing at my

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:14.180
 dude there ah and by speaking everything anything

00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:21.070
 people there is the place was another one then I

00:51:24.280 --> 00:52:01.400
 I speak correctly, I don't know what it is because he is difficult, the plague goat here in the

00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:10.970
 rio grande do norte o baiano with the gaucho male as hell but you don’t

00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:14.819
 can do more to be careful he is recording you

00:52:14.819 --> 00:52:19.650
 guys go to court and end your life i'm completing houses you are in

00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:24.180
 500 viruses will ultimately lose I will have to leave he will say that

00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:28.260
 I'll pay, look, I answered with a TV why wouldn't I not

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:33.200
 gay pride parade speaks because it believes in god in the family and good customs

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:38.130
 started in an association known as the niterói lesbian association

00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:43.349
 started with 150 reais in second instance believe 2nd instance the

00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:46.170
 prosecutor asked for filing rapporteur asked for filing and I missed

00:52:46.170 --> 00:52:50.550
 by 3 to 2 but it went up ok in the supreme federal court we count interest and

00:52:50.550 --> 00:52:55.319
 500010 monetary correction you don't know what to do anymore what to say more

00:52:55.319 --> 00:53:00.059
 I can’t continue to act that way and had to go back against that and

00:53:00.059 --> 00:53:03.720
 freedom of the press is very important otherwise you get

00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:10.380
 hostage to part of the life of the lighthouse you really do not live anymore and you will live

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:14.859
 it is not without information to drink and there are some more questions from those who

00:53:14.859 --> 00:53:24.430
 that now zé maria pedro ii and there

00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:31.420
 i was wondering about housing finance see this rogermany how much

00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:36.440
 comes out this is about financing with new

00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:42.320
 situations for financing the home and the president of the box is whether it is

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:47.569
 possible to recognize new and then

00:53:47.569 --> 00:53:52.249
 the old releases in this new legislation and that new concept

00:53:52.249 --> 00:53:58.960
 program that will be launched is just that it is because it is better now

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:02.830
 and then ok pedro first thanks for the

00:54:02.830 --> 00:54:06.880
 opportunity we are almost three months dealing with this process

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:11.860
 internally here with the economy with the cashier is not very careful so

00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:15.970
 because our idea is precisely that the largest number of

00:54:15.970 --> 00:54:21.700
 Brazilians have access to real estate credit so we are doing the

00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:26.200
 final negotiations I believe that we have already practically settled the

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:30.370
 pointers here in the next 15 days we will be able to launch the

00:54:30.370 --> 00:54:35.500
 program our idea is precisely to reduce a housing interest this passes

00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:40.450
 due to the question of the remuneration of the guarantee fund, as it is seeing a decrease

00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:45.100
 the Selic rate and this decrease will allow the considerable number of

00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:50.500
 families can have access to home financing we also

00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:55.720
 we had a negotiation with the cashier, which, like what it has done in other countries,

00:54:55.720 --> 00:55:03.380
 products, right, as was the case here, the overdraft is giving up

00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:07.790
 remuneration that has in its administration fee that will allow the

00:55:07.790 --> 00:55:12.290
 larger number is homes with the same subsidy as the one given by the federal government

00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:19.280
 is produced annually and we will is to opportunistically publish this number and

00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:25.730
 it is also a consistent land legalization program we have today 10

00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:29.630
 to 12 million housing units in brazil that have no public deed

00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:35.870
 right, so we’re going to launch a program that will help that will support

00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:41.240
 Brazilian municipalities so that they can enforce legislation that has already

00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:47.570
 has existed since the year 2000 and was redesigned in 2017 is not for small terms

00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:52.010
 housing reforms and land legalization is in Brazilian cities

00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:56.930
 so basically this is the fulcrum the backbone of the project and we hope in

00:55:56.930 --> 00:56:00.120
 soon they will be launching the project all over brazil

00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:07.290
 the pedro length he is as the rogério spoke is the box the bank of all

00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:12.320
 Brazilians have the housing bank so there is no type of

00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:18.800
 possibility of having a project as beautiful as the one where the box in the after

00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:25.410
 99 percent of low-income financing is made by Caixa Presidente

00:56:25.410 --> 00:56:31.830
 when is your government started the cashier was only twenty-two percent of the

00:56:31.830 --> 00:56:38.220
 market of the most middle income bracket and we reached this month with almost 50 per

00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:43.800
 percent because we are new products like the inflation product without inflation

00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:50.520
 and even the lowest rate in the market so exactly as the rogério spoke to

00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:55.260
 people will always help the population, which is our facebook youtube

00:56:55.260 --> 00:57:00.100
 80 thousand people and raindrops in is young pan card

00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:05.500
 there are 8 thousand so congratulations there the group still in the young pan drop in brother augusto

 of the Flemish and the van another question then ask the

00:57:56.430 --> 00:58:00.390
 president of the box pedro guimarães so the government decided to stretch the

00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:03.710
 payment of the provoked emergency aid will succeed

00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:10.609
 and two more payments in July and in August another R $ 1200 wanted to know about the

00:58:10.609 --> 00:58:14.900
 president of Caixa pedro guimarães if there have been changes in the system there if

00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:20.180

00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:24.830

 who had their first three payments approved do not need to register

00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:44.990
 so registration, in fact, the validity is automatic, the application today

00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:51.830
 has 108 million people is the biggest app in the world that we know in

00:58:51.830 --> 00:58:57.260
