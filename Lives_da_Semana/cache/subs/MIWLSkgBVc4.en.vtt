00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.089
What's up

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.840
 What's up What's up

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.650
 Hi good night Thursday 7 pm Brasilia

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.880
 and here our Elisângela interpreter of pounds

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.699
 the astronaut Marcos Pontes and has the empty chair in the ghost Tarcísio was the

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:33.610
 agreed and it has not arrived yet I will put a have night there who knows a position

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.610
 saturday and sunday there it was already in the case i already i already good because precisely that i

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.930
 I arrived late for graduation I stayed asleep I didn't wake up at the time I

00:00:43.930 --> 00:01:07.390
 I was late picked up What was the weekend because it is about Brazil with the

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:21.950
 The person you love, of course, has already arrived late because he already has the

00:01:23.569 --> 00:02:01.340
 present reminded me that I don’t believe that’s what it’s showing

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:09.439
 the company's air transport road is now

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:21.650
 the presentation you made is that you know the air teacher right there

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.150
 something presidential the simple program which is a program of

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.540
 deregulation of meaning of air transport and this was born because the

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.190
 people had been listening to the pilots in the professionals of the transport companies

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.849
 of aviation Agricultural of experimental aviation right of executive aviation to

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.810
 difficulty they had Christian cost are coming up there in the ministry

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.709
 in the program how are we going to do a series of regulatory simplifications

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:58.670
 There are more than 50 items of simplification for example validity of the qualification

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.069
 pilot that will pass will no longer have more validity because the

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.819
 pilot already takes health exam every year he already trains every year that he's flying

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:13.220
 you don't need to renew your license every year, and that is, of course, a course that

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.359
 people will decrease is a mechanic who will be able, for example, to provide assistance

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:23.100
 remotely This is a pilot that Viação that is there in

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.510
 middle of the field, right? And when she has a problem, because otherwise we

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.620
 there had to be a certified mechanic going to the field to do the

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.840
 maintenance is the simulator that will no longer be needed throughout the year out

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.270
 abroad to do the simulator exercise I was looking

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.140
 he goes every two years will not pass everyone else that the other provides service

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.580
 and if it was cheap too everybody everybody wins I intend even because

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.080
 invite you right I plan to go to Barcelos in the Amazon I want to meet

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.430
 a little bit I’ll want almost no tourism in the region

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.240
 yours since food when talking about hydroplane What have you facilitated to

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.360
 he brought an operation from that region to the seaplane that he couldn’t

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.470
 regulation by hydroplane he will be able to operate then when

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.070
 operated was that destination we are going to regularize the seaplane service in

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.609
 Amazon region come on this potential risk we have a big PIS

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:24.210
 And then it passed You counted until the day my friend there who has recourse advent no

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:30.069
 do a take the little plane to come from the plane to the Amazon region ok

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:35.770
 you can fish you can and fish without any problem between us we have show

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.560
 the seed too Let's open it up for the

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.580
 other countries also the staff will go to the region to explore duly authorized

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.220
 for us even to show that the amazon doesn’t catch fire is impressive right no

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.260
 on fire today there was a personal graduation from

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:59.500
 and the Itamaraty people, right? What’s the name of Rio Branco?

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.430
 saying that they are our spokesmen out there to show the truth here

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.150
 inside now tell the truth you are difficult it is easier to lie right Ah ok

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.260
 everything on fire there this insensitive government easier so i'm going to

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.610
 school has to show the truth even we are arranging a trip is

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.780
 via ours a out if you want strategic writing through the Rocha environment

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.400
 invite them ambassadors here from the countries, right, she, we, I want, I want

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.010
 doing a stretch together with them is good view Manaus I already did I already did

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.690
 Bandeirantes stretch I time to give I already made buffalo you will come here in this

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.370
 the whole route must be in the range of a thousand kilometers in more or less then you

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:49.090
 see or smoke ok you don’t see a hectare of forest plus one

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.270
 deforested and showed this module where it catches fire

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:59.780
 first of all everything is the is the small farmer is the riverside is the Indian Tá

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.900
 right Some are criminals yes only the criminal but the vast majority are not

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.470
 mark something that happened with this bad part and with all the simplification

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.890
 but flight safety butter was also not relaxing to remember that people

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:18.980
 are wondering you know by heart but tomorrow getting involved today is the day of

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:27.080
 parachutist I used to drop a little 400 meters high you went 400 km

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:33.500
 with this that is more or less distance rio-são Paulo is raises imagined that I

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:43.280
 I’m safer 400 meters or you 400 km Look I think I think it’s 400 km

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.900
 while inside the spacecraft 400 km without leaving there the environment is completely

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:53.000
 But our speed there is already protesting at 28,000 km per hour

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.400
 huh i will take my student time there to

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.740
 400 kilometers there is gravity there is this one that you don't fall for

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.630
 cause of what is movement is the dynamics of movement is basically as if it had

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:10.650
 falling off the ground all the time and you can imagine that centripetal acceleration

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:15.690
 there she against the scale makes a counterbalance by gravity this is the

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:21.030
 all the time gravity is just the two the two vectors right This piece What is the

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:25.950
 resulting from the vectors is is perpendicular to the axis that makes the earth shake and and

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:30.240
 almost zero the case example the result of them is almost zero because the

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.800
 season she goes down every day she loses a little, and 400km is still

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.160
 there is some race she starts to lose altitude every day we lose a little

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.260
 of the altitude why from time to time between I start the engines what

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.400
 already activated there to be able to increase the speed that we increase the

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.580
 speed it stabilizes a great being want to go back to the useful space

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.260
 do not have time to lose a little weight

00:07:53.260 --> 00:08:28.660
 and look, you need to lose a little bit, I have it all, and it’s almost Folha

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:42.060
 Politics 3 thousand young people out of 120 thousand who are watching us here now here look

00:08:48.649 --> 00:08:55.309
 And you too, with my son, I already have two vacancies in Rio de Janeiro, they were

00:08:55.309 --> 00:08:59.209
 Flávio also second third stopped Yeah more back and in the final stretch We

00:08:59.209 --> 00:09:04.160
 we entered his campaign and the campaign was this internet cost zero air

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.460
 where he ended up getting elected together with Flávio but unfortunately

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:15.120
 and our beloved olive leaf that was Kadett with 59 drinks takes 50 is the day

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.769
 four years old Already graduated from the Military Academy of Agulhas Negras

00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:24.889
 and then the position of Captain arrived did an imitate Juninho just like you asked for him

00:09:24.889 --> 00:09:31.040
 dismissal from the army worked as the state-owned ones was an evangelical religious and

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:36.319
 I was mistaken, I was the tenth of this to send me a federal deputy and the first

00:09:36.319 --> 00:09:43.519
 Senator's If I'm not mistaken 83 years of age out of 300 the trend across

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:51.170
 the world gets there right now it's calling the multicolored Red your body you will

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:55.340
 get there the day there will be old too

00:09:55.340 --> 00:10:01.180
 Fountain of Youth machine still not yet space there I don't want space there and

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:07.550
 when you go against the use there, if not, if you can't, you can't

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:13.220
 go out there on a monday arrives on sunday i teach you it wasn't me good spindle

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:18.920
 time in terms of time zone that on earth yes it can now be in the space that the

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:24.380
 personal speech is of relativistic effects is very insignificant even with 28 thousand

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:38.050
 km per hour of that and the brief retrospective Saturday we had

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:47.619
 Rezende you always had a word in the courtyard until I even noticed that in the class

00:10:47.619 --> 00:10:51.860
 who was getting a sword has many vocations for engineering

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:59.050
 (Laughter)

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.330
 (Laughter)

00:11:13.199 --> 00:11:39.650
 have that the number of vacancies 1 is but I believe that this technical weapon

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:44.810
 it would be good to receive this resource, because I follow along with the fabric

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:48.800
 while parliamentary for approximately ten years is the evasion of his

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:55.760
 loved ones sends here measures 190 per year Adding all official squares what

00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:00.860
 there will be three times there and a lot of people from Ita's military engineers and

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:08.930
 from IME Saúde then the engineer staff also from Maria and they are people who are

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:13.910
 very harassed by the private initiative You have been harassing until you have been

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:17.960
 ask so folks really want to buy the pass another your Tarcísio I

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:25.670
 I'll see Neymar here I arrived, you know, there is a person here in his area I already sold the

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:34.580
 exceptional is all praise see you can really see your work on the railroad

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:40.079
 highway and the 10 can also then ok son will

00:12:40.079 --> 00:12:45.450
 having an exceptional person There is no doubt that he is based on salaries

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:50.790
 astronomical that really lives up to its competence and it’s for patriotism

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:57.779
 with us I also do nothing now how much is it over there underneath

00:12:57.779 --> 00:13:01.500
 I could be winning with her she said she will talk it is not much more much more well

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:18.230
 more pray and other things from Brazil 1 paint the corruption there from Google Play do

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:22.040
 governor or parliament of the person you put in my account that which is my

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:27.920
 government are the 23 miniseries only access back and official banks I until today right

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:33.410
 We are almost two years 0 that I may be that peace cannot the name sight

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:37.160
 it may be the has a problem with video in the corner anywhere out there it will run

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.170
 back goes and such flown in the neck for you can

00:13:41.170 --> 00:13:45.370
 happen now we doing everything to make it happen but also because in addition to the

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:50.079
 technical criterion to nominate people our other minister of

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:55.540
 the controllership-general of the union is the captain also Wagner Rosário he is a guy who

00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:03.939
 he says he keeps running there, his record, you know, seeing contracts maybe

00:14:03.939 --> 00:14:11.889
 there is an audit of the contracts there with advertising, he takes them there and it’s not just in

00:14:11.889 --> 00:14:17.519
 his life is not out there either he takes it there to see if the contract is hitting with

00:14:17.519 --> 00:14:22.750
 what has prey learn first suitable first step there if the contract to be

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:27.579
 delivered what is in the contract the Federal Police turned on the yellow light

00:14:27.579 --> 00:14:33.540
 we don’t have to don’t have to bring any when I history here detonates me

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:37.689
 corrupt to do any third party in Brazil is happy service I would like

00:14:37.689 --> 00:14:41.820
 it doesn't happen a large sized help helps himiko

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:46.560
 who knows about us can go from there something that became routine since he charges

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.550
 right taking advantage of the return of this trip

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:55.050
 And of course other things working there Rezende will also be in Caçapava

00:14:55.050 --> 00:15:00.269
 Old you indicated when the beauty salon on the needle he was not married do

00:15:00.269 --> 00:15:09.709
 one thing is just to say old Passo Edna Santos Caçapava Velha to do a hair

00:15:09.709 --> 00:15:19.450
 Store whimsy at the space Edna Edna França e Caçapava

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:25.240
 Old woman I'm not charging started not charging you have to pay how much it is

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:32.440
 it must be very expensive very expensive but the good It has space in the middle also its Sunday

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:37.750
 it was a very special day for Laura's birthday you were invited what i'm

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:53.939
 owing a Drone pizza to her was beside herself

00:15:53.939 --> 00:15:59.999
 to see Let's hit a million okay Laura strong a candidate to sleep 22 right

00:15:59.999 --> 00:16:05.900
 no you can help Laura yesterday she has a little gift there at Sirius

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:14.500
 I remember that she gets a toy back there is

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:31.770
 What is the National Research Center in materials is energy and materials, right?

00:16:31.770 --> 00:17:07.600
 directed upwards of the century ago in good quality that you are an accelerator

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:16.010
 electron and fourth most advanced generation on the planet this is important is

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:20.959
 there are more than eighty percent done in national technology by companies

00:17:20.959 --> 00:17:27.350
 nationals is our most advanced science facility in the country and

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:32.510
 certainly more advanced here in the hemisphere world than in Latin America and is the

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:37.940
 his function is precisely to analyze the atomic structure molecular structure of

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:41.240
 any kind of material that we put it yesterday, we used this or the

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:49.610
 line Manacá the first line is already in operation And of course they do that

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:55.300
 with public resources and more and more difficult for you to invest but there

00:17:55.300 --> 00:18:01.190
 talking to the engineers they said that given the radio but about 15

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:06.590
 kilos given the excellence of companies that exist there we could also from there

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:13.640
 had been a biotechnology Silicon Valley to receive exactly there the

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:18.450
 eyelashes he is part of the cnp right his research in energy and materials besides

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:23.700
 of the particle accelerator we have a bio renewable laboratory a

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:30.000
 neuroscience laboratory and biological science laboratory do not

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.970
 it says of biosciences that is composed of our future, you know A

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:41.750
 Plan over there is a biosafety level 4 laboratory to be able to analyze

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:47.220
 study and work with viruses for example of very high dangerousness this

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:51.120
 there added smoke with all the science infrastructure we have in

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:56.490
 back universities other things will not get to Anita vermifugal solar

00:18:56.490 --> 00:19:01.620
 it started there also started at LNB, right National Laboratory of Biosciences 12

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:05.010
 thousand drugs being analyzed with artificial intelligence modeling

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:09.450
 mathematician from there five of them were selected to do in vitro tests

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:14.340
 with a real cell in the laboratory human cells this gives the nitazoxanide

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:19.690
 or Anitta us the cost is reached 94% inhibition of

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:24.340
 virus and then went through clinical species were 500 people 500 volunteers I

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:29.559
 I also saw people analyzing the rocks there, all of them are oil and could

00:19:29.559 --> 00:19:34.719
 increase productivity by one hundred percent almost one hundred percent the possibility of

00:19:34.719 --> 00:19:39.279
 According to this personal analysis, he went there and said he found the ideal detergent

00:19:39.279 --> 00:19:44.320
 to inject in the maximum amount of oil from Rocha how is that when it’s

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.369
 holding it there, you're losing it again, trying to stay within our time when

00:19:48.369 --> 00:19:53.499
 Infante works here in the production of the well starts to get low that if you find

00:19:53.499 --> 00:19:58.629
 ways to increase this production When you study the rock that was

00:19:58.629 --> 00:20:03.279
 a sponge with oil appears inside if you inject certain detergent you

00:20:03.279 --> 00:20:07.330
 manages to make this separation and increase production in this phase then 100

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:12.099
 percent will think is to think not to provide the whole combo or that kind of

00:20:12.099 --> 00:20:16.010
 study can increase from 7 to 10 percent the yield of the pre-salt imagines

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:21.080
 Hi catty I'm missing resource I remembered it appeared a while ago here you

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:28.910
 to take last past to trobras asked for an Advertising contract with

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:33.350
 a Formula 1 team 700 million reais in five years right you’re talking

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:36.080
 with the present at the time, right, I can't finish It has all the work

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.980
 the one who can, right, I saw in mine, we nominate the president

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:46.040
 doesn't do that and if found then it was it was terminated and now i said there

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:53.270
 no answer is yours are going to look for it to change again if there is one and not

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:59.930
 to speak despite a suggestion for work is to invest there in the center Centro

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:05.060
 of National Materials Research and if you have resources if you had 60 million

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:08.840
 you can be sure we would make our vase there the service of biotechnology

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:13.630
 people used to haunt money a lot 700 million 1

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:18.130
 and talk about corruption I will not say that this icy option for Everyone thinks that

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:22.900
 will understand but of course the other one, the bottom director here is working with

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:27.490
 four times it’s vibrating at the time

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:37.510
 it's not it's not a 700 million five year old would give 140 million a year Imagine what

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:43.530
 we would make the Campinas region happy until we look to see if it is possible ok

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:53.050
 for us to have resources, right, for the dead to leverage Science and

00:21:53.050 --> 00:22:00.820
 Search in our Brazil Look there to look there what the castle resort to

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:05.860
 Science Technology the investment he multiplies the time reminds him of that

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:12.700
 Israel and Japan business I can't speak speak remember I see that they don't

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:19.900
 sometimes you have Navy technicians in it you saw there how are we

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:25.540
 praying up to twenty percent and twenty percent 19.9 percent ally there is a

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:31.000
 center of the Navy that works with nuclear energy is and all this technology

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.490
 for enrichment of uranium and also motor development, right of the submarine

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:41.020
 Brazilian nuclear This is a project that has a long time and now from there on

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:44.070
 ministry has not been pushing enough the multipurpose reactor

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:48.080
 this multipurpose reactor is used not only to leverage these

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:53.779
 it is but also for health for agriculture many applications also have a return

00:22:53.779 --> 00:23:06.669
 of huge investment only Brazil is

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:11.280
 and the interest of the Americans in Brazil and there in Brazil in the Americans

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:18.630
 I also have a dream of adding value there Some minerals we have here and

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:22.380
 we do intend to seek agreement with countries such as the United States

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:27.060
 in this sense so that Brazil is not only known as an exporter of

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:32.790
 response commodities that have in the door field there came he usually says a lot

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:38.160
 event demands an iron ore ship there and receives 62 laptop ok and

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:44.850
 many times the impurity descent from Iron gives you to pay 50 trips from yesterday

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:51.890
 ship out this is called technology and the Mouse so Marco is fulfilling

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:56.730
 remember that we have the big and the even graphene and niobium lab and earth

00:23:56.730 --> 00:24:01.140
 rare already ready to be inaugurated of the return there we also stopped of form and not

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:06.190
 there’s nothing ok ok it works well And then Elias Fausto Elias very well to

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:10.950
 a football field we were very well received by the population was in the bakery

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:16.450
 I bought someone listening Even because I didn’t pay

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:28.690
 spoil the really a dream a coke and glass bottle also gets

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:31.200
 at ease and

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:40.100
 (Laughter) hello you enjoy it a little let me

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:50.270
 talk here go there Paulista has a two three months to do all of this but we are

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:57.530
 contract in April and May of May then you made a projection of how much will be

00:24:57.530 --> 00:25:01.370
 invested by the seventh private and all six billion trillion reais in five

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:06.830
 how many jobs how many jobs would generate access and there’s a guy there who

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:11.300
 not to mention name here it seems that before today you danced with you on the finger

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:15.110
 state of it then you say something about the Paulista network for us to go on the project

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:19.910
 it’s very good, right, but it’s from the Bolsonaro government and we did the extension of

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:24.620
 Paulista mesh is an important suitcase because it connects with the North mesh

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:28.640
 that sells Rondonópolis comes from Mato Grosso and connects with the railroad our

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:33.770
 that we did the auction there are being invested there 2.8 billion in the railroad

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:36.930
 north-south and next year in the middle of next year President will be Opera

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:41.610
 and it's going to be working, it's going to be calling and Santos is here in the mesh

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:46.800
 Paulista we will invest six billion reais in the next five years so

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:51.120
 we will have line doubling we will have sleepers replacement

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:55.530
 rail replacement construction of contours Railway construction of

00:25:55.530 --> 00:26:01.620
 maneuver yard the reactivation of the Colombia branch that was paralyzed was

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:07.530
 abandoned the reactivation of the Panorama extension and ultimately between

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:12.240
 The capacity of the railway doubles, and in these five years 35 million

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:16.620
 tons of capacity for 75 million tomato capacity and one billion and

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:21.000
 two hundred will already happen next year so it starts next year after

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.070
 we will invest 1.9 Bino access to Santos so that this cargo will not

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:31.380
 has a bottleneck in the arrival of Porto and few people know but today we are already

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:35.970
 down 22 million tons of grain from Mato Grosso to Santos Via

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:39.520
 railroad and and it has a lot in the coming years so it's a

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:43.960
 phenomenal investment which is one of the Railway investments that we're going to

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:48.670
 that we are doing people said the president to hire 30 40 million

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:52.360
 you don’t have to change the goal that almost 30 people have already hired another

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:56.220
 railroad thing its prediction to go out at night this started Maranhão

00:26:56.220 --> 00:27:04.750
 Tocantins Goiás dies in the port of Santos and it lacked the 1,500 km 6537 1107 mine

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:12.610
 Academy number 1531 is going to love it's first it should be finished by 22 gives

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:17.110
 to bring peace there we will go in June next year it will be ready and

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:22.300
 maybe explain mine has your favor good we will have all kinds of cargo right

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:27.880
 We’ll have the bulk balloons for commodity now for the container we’ll

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:32.020
 have the wagon will not operate with double wagon right with double Double Tech container

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:36.950
 that we call right, so it’s a lot more load due to the same composition

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:41.990
 it's so we adapt the special works of art sounds the overpasses we lowered

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:46.639
 line the man we are viaduct to be able to pass with these stacked wagons right

00:27:46.639 --> 00:27:50.450
 that will give a lot more capacity to the railroad was something we didn't

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:54.889
 in Brazil we started to operate in the North network, but the Paulista EA railroad

00:27:54.889 --> 00:28:01.070
 north-south operating in the same way it's going it's under construction we have for almost

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:06.889
 1,200 employees today working on construction in the Piauí Eliseu segment

00:28:06.889 --> 00:28:12.230
 Martins to Missão Velha in Ceará and from Missão Velha towards the

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:23.419
 people are at TCU for us to quote now to do the concession auction

00:28:23.419 --> 00:28:27.740
 first stretch that believe Ilhéus and the second stretch that Caetité

00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:31.940
 Barriers It is under construction including the participation of the engineering of our

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:36.930
 example has only been a great partner of Tarcísio of the works of the

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:43.080
 is the third has been exceptional How to praise the nine months nine Vinícius

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:47.160
 now there is a new one, right from January onwards that I Jorge has a jewel of

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:52.500
 Military Police will always be competent lawyer friend ok're happy bait

 Senate approval yesterday Did you know that his name has no problem

00:28:56.550 --> 00:29:01.530
 the very dear person worked with me and my son for a while there while

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:05.190
 parliamentarians his father is so deserted DVD Sergeant right a person

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:12.210
 unfortunately left us in 2018 but our Congratulations TCU da

00:29:12.210 --> 00:29:16.500
 José's person seeks the president yet something has happened yet something happened

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:21.000
 it's not just deep thanks thanks because we've been doing

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.850
 very used things that would not be and that will bring investment investment

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:31.110
 heavy and would not be possible if we did not have this understanding

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:35.610
 partnership this construction jointly with the Federal Court of Accounts are crack

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:41.380
 they are excellent coaches and will enhance that team that I was going to

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:45.490
 say that I'm holding for the service you I you want to make you iron

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:49.210
 from here to the moon that you think is stupid is hard doing here ok if you need

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:54.850
 of a place to learn things but it’s thinking and bridging it right there

00:29:54.850 --> 00:30:02.770
 Fernando Noronha the same despite doing something like this

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:07.840
 is a bridge from the bridge Ponte Vai right after it is easier to do this

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:12.970
 who hung it and or Vilma asphalting the third asphalt to the moon do you think

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:20.020
 what else to do is not possible Look I was holding here for the following I

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:25.360
 I started my life at Rede Ferroviária Federal da at the age of 14 and an electrician

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:29.740
 there apprentice there I always kept looking we need to have more railroad in the

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:35.980
 Brazil but if connected it works very well I lived in the 60s I lived in Jundiaí and

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:39.730
 there was a lot of family in Campinas, and the trips we did there she is

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:44.190
 Iron last he has cutter like that

00:30:50.490 --> 00:31:05.300
 tomorrow and And I missed the chance to fly in the past

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:10.100
 Geez more, let's see if the future I can do a little with him, but it's a case here

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:15.080
 the air force has been working on this project for a long time and he

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:18.920
 replaces back there that I wasn’t a test pilot yet back in the

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:23.630
 90 I made some flights to test in place of the tantrum wanting to replace

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:27.680
 trip now finally after all this time we have the glitter coming in

00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:31.820
 in operation that will be very good for air force to defend the country as a

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:38.870
 the whole troop goes to the event too many authors decorated friends

00:31:38.870 --> 00:32:05.980
 aeronautics look only the director of MS does not recommend the vaccine

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:12.340
 against color 2019 is mandatory God dude making a color matters to you

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:18.430
 you publish, right, ask when I go right, I don’t have it Can you lie so much to see

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:24.610
 when I was close to her and she also posted so MS is what she said

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:28.870
 for me another more commented moment the thing matters Do you believe it is not

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:33.130
 even if it doesn’t matter, you have to also have a look at whoever spoke to

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:37.210
 first time the vaccine didn’t have to be obliged it was me or was it MS

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:43.450
 to answer was no or smoking or it was me too who was me in the right place old

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:49.420
 I thought about running away it was me and what to depend on me I don’t know

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:54.280
 and until the until the national immunization program in addition to vaccines

00:32:54.280 --> 00:33:01.380
 mandatory who decides the program is and the ministry of health of the Patron

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:06.540
 okay, take a little, okay, it was really good, you know?

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:11.370
 quickly I put it in this way and also the bowl has to be if

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:16.200
 certified by Anvisa I do not send in life some found band in life not life

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.710
 like the agencies all your independence mine we see if you suffer dating

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:23.700
 all agencies there, right, but it's the same, we have to respect independence and

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:29.760
 then go go to work meeting her seriously here down there until reason

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:37.020
 Morena you're at work so life is not subordinate to me, right?

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:42.690
 indicates for Sabbath in the Senate Sou Eu from time to time the names are the teeth are

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:49.450
 how they are rejected from the page is not that of natural fathom goes through

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:55.000
 by the Sabbath in the Senate and sometimes a person who recommends people over there

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.840
 that we want to talk about Kátia is one thing and it goes on and on

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:03.460
 agency to pray quite closely doing this to us it is we even the very

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:08.889
 bar table right Mia personal communication and he is an exceptional doctor today he

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:12.550
 talking about giving an interview about this vaccine issue really person

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:21.129
 quite balanced who complains about a delay in VISA see a few years ago ok

00:34:21.129 --> 00:34:26.560
 that the thing that was not really resolved from God total reality and

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:32.109
 Anvisa only has to give praise for Anvisa and the viewpoint ba also said that

00:34:32.109 --> 00:34:37.149
 appearing a vaccine in the world, right, she came here first, health later

00:34:37.149 --> 00:34:41.800
 Anvisa that will give certification now he will not run will not be in 72

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:45.619
 hours and here he told me that he goes there and say that loud

00:34:45.619 --> 00:34:50.359
 distribution in Brazil After all, the responsibility I love doing the

00:34:50.359 --> 00:34:54.950
 question that is just yes or no because it crashed the car start thinking slices

00:34:54.950 --> 00:35:00.950
 that taking it all lit up the vaccine depends on you if it is mandatory or

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:05.299
 optional the account of you is as I said yesterday is not to miss active

00:35:05.299 --> 00:35:30.010
 optional on the state scene and has already managed to think that 18 governors

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:34.210
 this Kelly filing a lawsuit in the Federal Supreme Court so that the

00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:41.350
 surprise then it is their will for each state to determine if the vaccine is going to be

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:45.940
 mandatory or not well São Paulo we have no doubt that if I advise it will be

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:50.740
 mandatory right that the Supreme Court decides This way understood doubt if it will decide the

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:54.610
 way or not but it is mandatory for what the governor said a few days ago

00:35:54.610 --> 00:36:00.000
 has an image of him saying that the vaccine is mandatory for 45 million people

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.750
 lunch here is mandatory then the citizen goes there and takes bacedo

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:10.730
 and it appears soon afterwards it may be by the virus itself it may be mute disease

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:19.130
 right Another disease and aggravated by the hair can be injected the vaccine is this

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:26.180
 stinking citizen of family members will go to court Look that my husband my grandfather

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:31.730
 my uncle my great-grandfather died of a lot of fruit behind it now you can

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:43.130
 imagine you can imagine compelling someone to get a vaccine isn't it just said

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:49.370
 and just said the director of the MS just said that it will not be mandatory

00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:55.910
 the vaccine to depend on MS Has anyone seen any head of state in the world I

00:36:55.910 --> 00:37:00.260
 I haven’t seen yet say that your country’s vaccine will be mandatory Regional to another

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:05.030
 thing they wanted him to buy 100 million doses of the vaccine from China or

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:09.680
 I was not going to do it, it’s not yet recognized by the health game it wasn’t

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:14.360
 certified by Anvisa click buy if I'm seeing something from the press

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:19.630
 hit me Ah ok hit me how much does it cost

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:23.619
 then I don’t know why he ruled that government also has a video of him

00:37:23.619 --> 00:37:28.810
 the video another video of him also saying that he will sell São Paulo every page of

00:37:28.810 --> 00:37:34.030
 suddenly saying that you are going to buy is going to be mandatory either to justify the expense

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:40.180
 will apply is this does not work like this while I go by the Republic will not

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:46.030
 be that way this is democracy EA Freedom no one will compel anyone

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:52.720
 get the vaccine and whoever does not take it without getting contaminated will die one day

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:58.990
 his answer now force the guy to get the vaccine ok he can die for other

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:05.349
 things more to have, you know, help the lawyer think there was a cause-effect relationship

00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:10.780
 with the vaccine sue the state as to what you saw a lot this could for

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:16.220
 reveal were provided the apprentices of dwarf figure dictators

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:24.109
 and hypocritical dumb boçais think that it will be in charge of his state will

00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:33.230
 take a vaccine will take you put a canister that you will understand coca-cola for the

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:37.760
 Bahia will take you to understand the fight and other people will be fired there

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:44.210
 and I doubt it here justice doesn’t matter I hope it’s going to force someone

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:50.600
 it took five days you do not exist there is not only God to have freedom put epoxy

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:55.490
 don't want to say something to you and the free charge the following just

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:59.300
 to remember that we did all the tests with Volunteers for me to do the

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:03.380
 life exam and every time you have a volunteer to do they have to

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:08.240
 sign a document ie the deal is not tested is not done yet you

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:11.000
 can compel anyone to make a participate as a volunteer put your

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:19.400
 life-threatening you did, right, it didn't even have side effects But even

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:33.260
 so you have to make a bridge that connects nothing to nowhere to abandon

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:40.680
 abandoned that picks up and goes to the and I think for União motor a

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:44.340
 respect that I have several Ribeiro only from there is not rewarding for what we

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:47.940
 have knowledge here if he presents What is the economy of Vale do Ribeira in

00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:52.920

 They will usually fall in love with him and I will see in CEAGESP will change back in

00:40:31.079 --> 00:40:35.970
 São Paulo it is not easy for you to work in some state-owned companies Brazil do you have

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:40.800
 all the time other things more time but it's not easy that's it Santos I

00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:45.359
 I already had I think there is no viado Economics has no cargo Rail right to maintain

00:40:45.359 --> 00:40:50.099
 that stretch within the concession now the domain range is available

00:40:50.099 --> 00:40:53.920
 so we can use it in partnership with the city halls of the region

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:58.390
 the domain for the mobility project for the tourist train for the extension of

00:40:58.390 --> 00:41:05.349
 Via Municipal Privada You are now ready to be cheaper than your feet to do

00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:10.680
 everything do you think a private company I would invest in there for the purpose of

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:16.290
 low-load tourism we have to take the test, you have to do the hearing

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:20.430
 of the market now we will have a very good idea about it when the

00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:24.630
 our railroad authorization project was approved in Congress he

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:27.810
 will give us the exact dimension because then any investor who wants to

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:33.960
 taking a risk Rail will be able to take and own the railroad

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:38.070
 it will be eminently private investment, right? It has a series of

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:42.420
 Tariff Freedom benefits a longer time for the exploration of the asset

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:47.310
 does not have the reversibility of goods is a revolutionary project

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:57.260

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:22.010
 excellent deal will boost truck freight much more than it was

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:27.740
 the President moment if the ship leaves the port with 18,000 with 18,000 contains has

 money destined to combat covid-19 was facilitated by purchases without bidding

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:10.850
 what should be done to prevent this type of robbery

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:17.510
 and thank you thank you Augusto it’s a lot of time, right No but we can talk about

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:24.230
 combating corruption in general and We created in the ministry structure

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:28.550
 a program called anti-corruption radar we take the determination there very seriously

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:32.420
 of the president to create the area of ​​integrity today in the ministry of

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:36.580
 structure We have two Federal Police Delegates working in the office

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:42.230
 but a whole team that works in support we have an intelligence officer

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:49.160
 we have the staff at Egeo and this has helped us to combat the problems of

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:53.960

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:06.380
 differentiated channel for handling complaints and this is preventing the

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:10.340
 wrongdoing so it's an incentive that we had the determination of the president has

00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:12.690
 intolerant and with the issue of corruption and it's giving

00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:18.720
 Serra Augusto much Imagine if there was no way for you to investigate

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:24.750
