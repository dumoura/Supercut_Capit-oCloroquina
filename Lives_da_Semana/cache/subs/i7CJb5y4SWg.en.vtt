00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:07.229
and it is a sensation to return to my state of Maranhão

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.160
 So, what's the quickest bit of

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.650
 federal government actions here in the state of Maranhão have been talking to the

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.980
 Senator Roberto Rocha dealing with this issue

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:31.539
 and last year dear residents dear residents of Alcântara the

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:39.730
 federal government dispensed 18 billion reais for the state of Maranhão we

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.640
 do not look on the map to know if I was voted well or not in the statute here I was the

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.150
 last State of Tocantins EA vote taking into account the proportionality

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:59.739
 but here all of us returning or not in me we are equal we are Brazilians we have

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.400
 needs and we want to evolved more and more

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:15.440
 of that 18 billion resource for Maranhão is one, 3 billion went to health

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:23.020
 to 190 million exclusively for beds and ICU does not justify Senador Roberto

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.110
 Rocha any complaint that there are no ICU beds to meet our needs

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.550
 maranhenses brothers the house committed the color 2019

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:41.030
 and also gentlemen are certainly here a considerable part of the Lord

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.650
 today received emergency aid for the state of Maranhão at the hands of the Lords

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:55.310
 directly without going through an intermediary were 13 billion reais because

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.800
 we understood together with the Deputy Parliament and Senator here

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.470
 present who voted in favor on these issues that there was a need and

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.370
 help those who, along with the pandemic, hear a lot of job closings

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.270
 work and you needed something to help you survive and the government

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.180
 so I repeat for Maranhão alone 13 billion reais at the moment our

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.080
 team together with parliamentarians and we studied

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.730
 is the extension for a few more months of emergency aid that I repeat the name is

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.640
 emergency cannot be eternal because it represents a very indebtedness

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.400
 great of our country and nobody wants the country broken and we know that the people

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.790
 wants in fact it is work and together with this bench that this

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:01.910
 present here together with people from the Economic team more and more we

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:09.910
 we make life easier for those who want to work as well as those who want to employ

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:18.840

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:26.310

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.760
 flow of the month is so common in previous years the rare ones that had less than

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:39.960
 10 in a few days or hours ceased to exist and how do you fight like

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.670
 is that we fight land invasion that everyone who has a property

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:50.430
 do not want it to be invaded in the specific case today granting the

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.770
 property title those in possession there is no use you making a plan of

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.940
 land reform and does not give a role in the end to show

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:11.440

 our work and the field goal gentlemen in two years of our government we deliver

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.490
 more title than 20 years from previous governments is a historic mark now

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:30.490
 it seems there was no interest in giving the title that the man without title just the the

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:36.940
 he still possesses a man in a situation of almost slavery And every time I see you
