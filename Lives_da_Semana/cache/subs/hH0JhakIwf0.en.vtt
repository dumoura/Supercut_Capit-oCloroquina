 ok you were invited you say you can't my birthday and it's true i

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.970
 I got it, I'm lying. Okay, hi, good night.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:24.740
 in Brasilia on March 19 7 pm two days from now

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.050
 there will be a love party here at home right attention press will have a party here

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.890
 at home my birthday me and my wife and two daughters or will I

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.809
 I'm forbidden to and to do this expensive party it was always

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:45.530
 so I never had a birthday celebration, right, because I don’t have

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.480
 opportunity I don’t really like it’s okay come on

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.960
 the last now I just finished training the gift of segovia our

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.650
 our admiral do you like president of pepsi who tested positive for coronavirus

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.970
 I asked him if he was feeling anything said nothing nothing all normal

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.540
 his life must be 55 years old a little bit

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.610
 i started now with general heleno who has been denying 74 years is in the room

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:23.060
 the day that the coronavirus was positive, he’s feeling already, he said nothing

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:30.050
 I just finished 50 minutes on the bike, ok, so is Admiral Benedict

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.120
 that the minister of mines and energy

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.410
 and it’s also tingling sure that the surgery I talked to him today feeling

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.180
 something and I wanted to work just at home here okay

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.710
 logically for some people in the square people if they hadn’t done the

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.950
 test would be working transmitting the virus to someone obviously a but not

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.840
 you know he doesn't know he was doing this transmission from the glass to

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.680
 some older people who have other problems the infection becomes

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:13.209
 serious and in very few cases it can lead to death so the concern

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:21.760
 government exists but I want to see you next that tomorrow at 22 and 30 on Saturday I

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.930
 I recorded an interview for a little over an hour for the mouse so I said

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.640
 a lot that will air tomorrow so I’m not going to go into too much detail here

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.160
 coronavirus issue, because tomorrow if god wants it will

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:41.480
 the father is there in the mouse program and it will be bigger quite short today

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:51.590
 maybe we for the concierge here we close here the borders of Brazil right

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.250
 right i will say the name of the journalist she will say that aggression right but

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.760
 right for a journalist and we don't close with chile we look for a way to

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.430
 closing the border with chile will not be possible was not possible ok we did not find the

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.190
 border with chile taking a journalist then said that he wanted wanted

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.300
 know why they squeezed it wasn't closed at the coching border it wasn't

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:17.570
 because here comes the straining power, we have no border, so these measures that help

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.210
 to prevent it a little bit from the road

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.350
 possibly infected people in brazil although the work of all

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:34.780
 countries at the moment is to lengthen the infection curve because if it’s too fast it’s

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:42.100
 we don’t have the means to attend the hospitals, it’s with equipment and we know that

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:49.000
 although it is a small portion of the population that will be subject to this

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.570
 but half acquire the gyrations and don’t even know about this other half that

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:02.560
 left over is almost 80 eighty percent according to statistical data

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.150
 have some kind of symptom and only around five percent and even then

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.770
 a smaller percentage of that after that that takes the older ones who will

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.190
 have some more serious problem but again we are taking the steps

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.859
 all is applicable mine works does not take panic

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.599
 and the Brazilian population is fine tomorrow if god wants in the mouse program

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:28.490
 more information about that so we close the border we are concerned

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.219
 is that of venezuela in pacaraíma city is a dry border ok it is not easy

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:39.740
 you you close a border like that because I don't have any accidents there

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.530
 There are no rivers and it is difficult but we will do our best to comply

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.469
 this role since a presidential determination we’re not just closing here

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:56.990
 with uruguay because we are in common agreement looking for a way to

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:03.199
 do here what matters is the two countries and i'm sure it took new

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:09.000
 president is that agreement and if it was nicely stitched a

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.440
 the price of gasoline is just always complaining with very high reason I will not dispute

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.660
 with no one here just inform for today the gasoline dropped the seven and

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.640
 half a percent at the refinery seven and a half percent diesel dropped twelve percent

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.670
 today at the refinery and the gas that gas you consume at home there five percent

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:37.230
 from january to january until now we are basically completing

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:42.919
 80 almost 80 days and gasoline dropped by thirty percent

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:49.830
 so whoever is putting out gasoline the first january r $ 5 should be in

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:55.889
 around three 50 ok diesel has spent almost 30 also 29 percent and gas

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:01.139
 eight percent and the federal government does its part up

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.219
 because it is not an imposition of the government to reduce the price of fuel this is

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:11.009
 a petrobras policy varies the price of oil abroad by more or less

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:17.429
 less not instantly, right, because it has to be diluted over

00:06:17.429 --> 00:06:25.669
 some days the same percentage falls here in Brazil too, so repeating here

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:33.719
 gasoline in refineries low thirty percent in the year looks at diesel 29 and gas from

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:41.410
 cooks eight percent and also those who like loans there

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.860
 decrease in interest rate for retirees who paycheck-deductible loan

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:51.830
 went from 2.08 to 1.8 also a little bit more from me 1.8 percent per month

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.990
 oh this is it four times five times right, more or less the present fraction

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:03.770
 of the month, more good news for those who have a loan, then he started to

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.790
 question of helping here the largely unemployed 200

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:11.450
 employees is what is in the informality was already in the informality and lost its

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:16.340
 job I had the week that the present in the union of bars and restaurants spoke

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.670
 that this sector employs approximately 6 million people

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:27.690
 hi and most of them are people who are informal, so the government

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:34.950
 did everything possible ok and to meet then it is these people among other informal

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:41.190
 other professions will be more or less 20 million people I don't have much more

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:47.009
 much more than that in informality but they will not lose a job 20 minutes

00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:52.770
 and the one decided so far has all 200 ml per person you four billion a month

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:57.029
 because this measure is worth three months, but for those who have nothing

00:07:57.029 --> 00:08:01.909
 help and this is where we can go and say stay very clear a large part

00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:07.289
 we can only be able to attend because the congress approved our

00:08:07.289 --> 00:08:15.360
 request to declare a state of calamity, that is, the government can spend more than

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:25.649
 the ceiling, right, is that provided for in the specific legislation then it is the moment that the

00:08:25.649 --> 00:08:30.779
 people will extrapolate time and we will not respond according to the law of

00:08:30.779 --> 00:08:35.960
 fiscal sidewalks ie thanks to the congressional decision we can

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:41.300
 to spend a little more and serve those who now need several other measures

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:46.580
 are being announced is the government of paulo war has to work 26 years and

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.960
 I'm kind of a team in that sense, right? We have taken notice and the measures

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:56.360
 are being implemented in waiting for you think that three months this crisis right

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:03.830
 this peak of the virus he and he improves to improve and and from a

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:10.490
 six seven months more or less the countries right brazil in this case goes back to normal

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.920
 here look and the Bolsa Família collection we include

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:20.949
 more than a million beneficiaries quite a lot of people I know that a good social project

00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:25.240
 the one who takes people away, right, but in the moment of crisis, I start there

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:29.740
 complicated to make the sieve because the number of cities increases and rightly so

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:37.240
 jesus meet a million more people at the family purse but something nothing

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:43.990
 the UK is doing the first human medicine test

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:51.790
 united states released right drug with potential for treaty

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:57.550
 and the coronavirus is an Israeli authority conventions they think that in the

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:04.540
 within a month the possibility exists and a one month period israel has a one

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:11.020
 vaccine for the colonel saw if god wants it to end it happened right always asking

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:18.610
 to god there that may bless our country help us there to face this problem

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:23.040
 ok but if god wants Israel again

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:33.480
 who can help us is that evil that has caused damage

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.399
 very large, especially in countries where the population is much older with

00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:45.930
 example to go to the population of italy selic rate yesterday four point pastor

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:52.709
 25 to 3.75 minus half a center england went to 0.1 percent to

00:10:52.709 --> 00:10:58.199
 interest rate was already down to 0.1 percent this here right each

00:10:58.199 --> 00:11:05.610
 percent the selic rate saves you just over 30 billion a year from

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:11.370
 interest for him ju ok so this is welcome here is for Brazil now there is no

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:15.680
 doubt that there was a tremendous one the balance in the economy did not

00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:18.649
 I'm from Brazil with the whole world and what I expected to grow this year

00:11:18.649 --> 00:11:21.180
 unfortunately we will not achieve this goal

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:27.110
 is one more thing is is is quite a few some authorities

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:34.000
 states are taking action the complaint sense has been praise

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:41.980
 also but I make it clear that the medicine when it is in excess may not do

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:48.389
 well to the patient, right, with his supermarket floor wanting to close the portus

00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:56.019
 wanting to put a barrier on the border between states by closing gyms at

00:11:56.019 --> 00:12:01.930
 economy has to work ok because otherwise people will not

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:09.190
 stay at home and eat there out of nowhere you have to look for ways to survive and

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:16.269
 if the job is missing I lack the bread at home and the problems and your personal cake

00:12:16.269 --> 00:12:23.170
 sorry, the time is the moment if we have a friend on the 7th death here in

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:28.030
 Brazil I regret it is starting tomorrow I want to speak to the Ministry of Health

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:33.520
 so that all eyes, right, I can make available the logically the name

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:39.160
 we preserve it there because the age of the person who suffered from

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:46.390
 some problem and obviously in being infected you know to what extent the virus does not

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.650
 influenced this death or that person was already in the situation quite

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:56.890
 complicated by old age and also the health problem thank you guys

00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:03.450
 tomorrow at 22 and 30 sbt mouse a hug to all and until next Thursday
