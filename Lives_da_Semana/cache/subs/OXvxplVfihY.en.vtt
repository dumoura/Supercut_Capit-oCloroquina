00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.180
 I finished with the car wash the impressive hypocrisy of many people right and great

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.680
 part of the Press for my government has no passion fruit we don't have a news and

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.540
 corruption so for us the car wash has no purpose thank god now

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.439

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.719

 Petrobras stuck inside more of things that will occur until the 2015 response then

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.280

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.860
 are in bad faith or have elbow pain 1 year and 10 months without corruption in our

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.319

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:36.770
 now past he's my past the boards right it's all a joke to the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:42.640
 political party So it's obvious that you had a problem Do you have a director

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.280
 appointed by someone else's imposition when I reached the top 120

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.290
 160 executives were changed in the 22 directors unless they are still there too

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.760
 so the car wash is understood or I want to end the clothes I already finished with the

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.989
 car wash this is for people too As I said you can’t keep up with a

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.769

 contact President Vladimir Putin there to seek solution to the case what that

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.920
 is this Crato who is Robson will be motorized

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:39.130

 What is a woman wisely candidate a woman is from the military police is evangelical

 Damares is and is a set is a lot of deliveries to

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:30.770
 mother that involves a lot of ministry and the resources of make a billion reais I think

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:37.280
 that has never been invested so much here in the Ilha do Marajó Ok region within

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:43.460
 a good thing president regarding light energy this week i've been from

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:49.790
 Northeast of Goiás for the first time I heard that the government minister went there

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:55.120
 is not to move in what any government and we went to deliver the light to

00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:01.250
 400 president families who are rural settlers in the Northeast and Goiás

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:07.250
 flor de Goiás went there with Governor Ronaldo Caiado and sleep imagines what

00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:12.860
 what that means for these people is dignity and citizenship is are new

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:17.720
 opportunities that have arisen there for the once in a while our Minister

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.670
 head over there but it is for resources to better serve the population

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:26.350
 and don't have a fight for resources to attend to personal projects that you want

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:30.280
 you in France, that’s it, you’re going to have some minor years

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.540
 Maybe the smallest the next year will be even smaller but we are

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:40.810
 doing what we can do and we warn you know this is complete work has

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:44.170
 Governor's work the spotlights back five percent will be completed and if

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:48.400
 you do not finish here will end up deteriorating and feet all that

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:53.650
 complete mass ownership works from previous governments have no

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:57.160
 demerit in that is not seeing everyone and we make it very clear that the works are not

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.150
 but I do not want to invent a new Work now to be a brand of mine and

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:05.560
 bury the little we have of environmental resources and stop completing works

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.550
 so important that there is very little to be able to serve the population like the

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:13.540
 president we are doing this with all governments with all

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:18.160

 that helps sooner rather later, you know, increase the greed for the Amazon that

00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:27.440

 days would you say that your ministry that has been the target of several investigations

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:59.300
 you are free without percent corruption or you have to fight in that story

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:05.069

00:43:05.069 --> 00:43:09.989
 ministry is always being eradicated, corruption I can tell you

00:43:09.989 --> 00:43:16.589
 that so far I can guarantee that corruption in the ministry does not exist but

00:43:16.589 --> 00:43:21.599
 as you said surveillance is important the governance criteria

00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:27.329
 are important we have the controllership-general of the Union that makes a

00:43:27.329 --> 00:43:32.279
 follow-up service and the people as president here placed and were

00:43:32.279 --> 00:43:36.930
 placed there we were free to choose people wanted to work

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:41.069
 with us and what can I say to you that I am very satisfied

00:43:41.069 --> 00:43:47.039
 I trust them but everyone is imbued that we have to rescue the history of

00:43:47.039 --> 00:43:51.839

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:39.670
 Independents crying there in the month of April beating themselves all the time

00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:45.200
 now what happens i was talking about we have two problems in front of the virus in

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:49.630
 job we have to treat them both simultaneously with the same responsibility

00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:59.620
 I didn't invent that akina and the cfw american warning started to

00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:04.780
 research I talked to Ernesto the meniscus is also very criticized

00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:09.550
 far-right guy was happy with the engine, Marighella was already there

00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:14.080
 I was there visiting foreign relations, right? So I consulted

00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:18.520
 Ernesto because the people in Sub-Saharan Africa are not dying anybody who

00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:24.340
 that it is natural to die more people then poorer malaria malaria Thanks

00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:31.780
 I'm using chloroquine, it was used for two things, first take it there and without

00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:38.110
 wanting for a virus that I didn’t know but little by little I saw that at an early stage

00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:43.660
 was right Claudina and I want to see asking here with the problem I had with the

00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:48.780
 minister who was the poster boy the Globo marketer, you know, the minizoo maneta

00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:52.910
 I called one of these so I’m not a doctor but don’t expect from the Republic

00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:57.470
 I'm going to play well but Guetta in the protocol is saying that there is no protocol

00:50:57.470 --> 00:51:02.210
 you can only use it So platinum at home the bass at home the bass no

00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:08.070
 it works And there is no zero strip

00:51:08.070 --> 00:51:13.980
 pregnant there and you one-handed have to let a doctor decide who decides in the end

00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:19.350
 of the accounts is the doctor the admiral equals the war of the pacific the

00:51:19.350 --> 00:51:23.870
 American soldier arrive at the wounded without blood had no more donors

00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:29.930
 resolving that do what put coconut water in the life of the guy and it worked

00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:34.980
 Imagine if I had to wait for scientific proof how many hundreds

00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:40.830
 perhaps thousands of soldiers had not died at that time and here the

00:51:40.830 --> 00:51:44.460
 great doctors a part a part of doctor started using colorful started to

00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:51.050
 to make sure that I’m loving took the other one was good there Dori Alberto Dória

00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:57.840
 how should he whip had a little video was cured of asking for

00:51:57.840 --> 00:52:02.970
 he took what he was a converter he took here in the question my doctor will

00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:08.910
 ask sh * t onion who ate the deal any start to go right was

00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:14.070
 increased obligation to try to show speak You can take this one and then

00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:19.390
 the prescription appeared here man and the medical prescription appeared

00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:24.199
 here at the door and in some governing states

00:52:24.199 --> 00:52:30.319
 verbally Mayor is banned Platinum which was simply politicized the

00:52:30.319 --> 00:52:35.239
 hydroxychloroquine, which was the medicine from bolsonaro, right? I even gave it to us to go

00:52:35.239 --> 00:52:39.109
 there in Alvorada that medicine to do saying there is offered that is running

00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:46.189
 Okay, there's a problem, not now. We have to try the worst object, Sil o

00:52:46.189 --> 00:52:53.630
 ship left here If you think that throwing all the oil in the sea we will see player will

00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:57.709
 have risky operation, you will do it, you will open it here

00:52:57.709 --> 00:53:02.689
 doing here is the same thing and hydroxychloroquine does not cause arrhythmia

00:53:02.689 --> 00:53:09.469
 who just said that there was the European Society of Cardiology

00:53:09.469 --> 00:53:16.459
 I was the one who 2016 of the funerary TV, you warned me that there was no side effect

00:53:16.459 --> 00:53:25.380
 nor did it cause us socks in 2000 and in 2020 they changed them and now society

00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:31.739
 European Cardiology says it doesn't cause we see lost when back there

00:53:31.739 --> 00:53:38.699
 I told Paulo Guedes BTG do not call PG PG I post Ipiranga you can

00:53:38.699 --> 00:53:45.140
 take taxes there David also on the land And because it is present Look because it helps to

00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:52.760
 fight the race Love let's take it off now we got it right logically right I talked

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:59.180
 with tetra life and we took taxes was nominated without proof President

00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:02.930
 bolsonaro send tax green vitamin now it is proven that the

00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:08.180
 vitamin D helps fight baldness is soft and has Governor and Mayor who

00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:12.680
 banned the beach people that the vitamin in disgrace is on the beach taking

00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:19.780
 alone look just write everything wrong it's all in the name of good save your life

00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:24.960
 I will stay at home is not for you not to catch the warning is for over time

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:30.510
 people when they get contaminated for a longer period not having a child and hospitals

00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:35.540
 Oi and Henrique Henrique Nossa Henrique doesn't like the poster boy minister

00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:41.280
 Globo marketer, we send her to talk because she stays at home when she has

00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:45.660
 photo we keep running away ok go to the hospital

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:52.859
 and from there the purchase of respirators precipitated the price it had in the

00:54:52.859 --> 00:55:00.910
 coincidence market right coincidence right another question there

00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:07.330
 and even in matters by the company beat my will there saw Sobral

00:55:07.330 --> 00:55:14.160
 that's it since november last year sofa stopped in the Chamber the process of

00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:19.120
 privatization of Eletrobras including a few days the Minister of Economy Paulo

00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:23.680
 Guedes of a statement saying that Mayor Rodrigo Maia

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:27.610
 works against privatizations that would be holding back privatizations in

00:55:27.610 --> 00:55:31.740
 Camera then discs

00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:36.559
 And then I destroy Guedes and Rodrigo Maia

00:55:36.559 --> 00:55:40.219
 mayor wanted to know if the Lord is facing this

00:55:40.219 --> 00:55:44.079
 possible to expect that now with that

00:55:44.359 --> 00:55:48.950
 And then it is better to sleep National Congress

00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:56.190
 finally is unlocking the creation of Eletrobras and 4 Parts

00:55:56.190 --> 00:56:04.920
 the present thank you very much for the question i took this bill in hand at

00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:11.520
 November 5th of last year and I gave it to President Rodrigo Maia

00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:16.380
 president of the Chamber of Deputies Since that time we have been working together

00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:20.069
 with the National Congress President I usually say that the National Congress

00:56:20.069 --> 00:56:26.280
 its knows much better than all of us has its own dynamics we approve

00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:31.109
 several bills now in this very important period not only for the

00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:36.270
 electricity sector but also for the oil and gas sector and will continue to be

00:56:36.270 --> 00:56:42.329
 so the privatization or capitalization of Eletrobras which is better is fundamental to

00:56:42.329 --> 00:56:47.310
 Eletrobras like other state-owned companies have lost their ability to

00:56:47.310 --> 00:56:52.650
 investment So instead of continuing to provide service to society is increasingly

00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:56.170
 instead providing the same services to society and that is what

00:56:56.170 --> 00:57:04.240
 the Oscar is that Eletrobras will again be sure of the importance that it had

00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:08.859
 for the country in the last 60 years and that’s what we’re building with the

00:57:08.859 --> 00:57:13.599
 National Congress the dialogue never ended we continue to work and

00:57:13.599 --> 00:57:18.520
 when Congress judges that it is time to appreciate the bill We

00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:23.310
 we believe that it will already be ripe to be approved is

00:57:23.310 --> 00:57:29.250
 the power your independence love nor if you would like it to be more serious right

00:57:29.250 --> 00:57:34.830
 faster but within a congress the camera there has the most varied multiples

00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:40.940
 and interesting you were your word was three years 55 years old is almost a

00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:46.220
 deputy at risk here I know that interests are very certain parties are

00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:51.780
 for favorable hiring are contrary many times have gone away

00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:57.540
 politician who wants state-owned companies there to put others inside to do

00:57:57.540 --> 00:58:01.440
 [ __ ] right another one even to do a good thing Okay but it's a huge interest

00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:05.520
 inside the congress sell in the comments and a lot of people asking for back

00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:10.560
 to classes What depends on me back to school today better I hadn’t even interrupted

00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:17.670
 to the lessons ago, that's right, but whoever determined the coercive measures there

00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:23.320
 governors and mayors and after a decision by the federal supreme court and

00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:27.670
 suddenly a desire turning that more than depending on me I already talked to

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:32.110
 the patron has already talked to the minister of education a thousand also goes back to school in

00:58:32.110 --> 00:58:36.430
 Raposo I like to depend on me as already a decision that was the

00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:42.610
 Ministry of Health a few weeks ago The fans' return at the stadiums in

00:58:42.610 --> 00:58:48.730
 first thirty percent is 12 fans Okay, just this video

00:58:48.730 --> 00:58:55.000
 it never goes away for sure the guy is wrapped up today he is going to get out of here

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:59.170
 two years ago there will be a guy there I find a guy who has to be with

00:58:59.170 --> 00:59:04.470
 virus and it will catch it ok now who knows until then until the vaccine right the vaccine

00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:10.840
 proven to be reliable from there

00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:16.660
 closed with up because people aside 40 years of construction noise is 0.01

00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:20.660
 something right and that's how these people have a community

00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:30.849
 Hi son I already asked who the last Fiúza

00:59:31.069 --> 00:59:35.010
 And then hello below the video

00:59:35.010 --> 00:59:41.060
 So what about five million reais

00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:46.980
 return Petrobras takes the deviations happened to leave in the so-called scandal of the

00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:53.450
 oil and a recent Petrobras operation on the supply board

00:59:53.450 --> 01:00:00.030
 showed that this scheme for example had passed the end of the government of the

01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:05.430
 PT how are you seeing this process of decorating the company at all

01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:11.310
 Petrobras specifically and in the pressure area where the project was created

01:00:11.310 --> 01:00:16.260
 specifically for deviations how has the Lord seen the sanitation of this

01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:22.230
 okay area just satisfied with the aging conditions Thank you

01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:27.420
 I can tell you Fiúza that I am satisfied is that the current administration

01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:34.200
 Petrobras and this operation that had in the Federal Police of the jet lava in the

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:40.270
 Petrobras this week of the board the cement is not on Face about any

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:45.250
 Petrobras employee who is exercising any activity at the time

01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:50.860
 are from employees who worked at Petrobras and there I don’t know how much more

01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:56.560
 5 years So these operations continue Petrobras continues to provide the service

01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:00.100
 now when i say i am satisfied with the administration of

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:04.960
 Petrobras is as I already commented here President Petrobras broke the record

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:11.170
 of oil exports broke the pre-salt production record in the

01:01:11.170 --> 01:01:16.000
 pre-salt that we held auction last year and Petrobras is hitting

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:22.660
 records in the largest offshore field That is to say in the world sea which is the boot field a

01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:27.940
 Petrobras has recently hit but almost 900 thousand barrels of oil production

01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:31.360
 oil per day so President I think we can say that we

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:36.160
 we are satisfied with Petrobras and that is what is important the next day

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:39.979
 that I don't know is very good Federal right the possibility the

01:01:39.979 --> 01:01:46.339
 Cássio over there the next day the Supreme Court decided if I'm not mistaken for 6 to 4 months

01:01:46.339 --> 01:01:51.380
 to 44 that Petrobras refineries could be sold on a wheel of

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:57.769
 This conversation makes it easier and selling this sale lowers the price correctly

01:01:57.769 --> 01:02:02.209
 President, there is no way to have new companies on the market and that is what

01:02:02.209 --> 01:02:09.109
 and this is a decision by Cade, which is the one that that TV council

01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:14.539
 just how the market is operating and this and this council decided that the

01:02:14.539 --> 01:02:18.799
 Petrobras should make investments to sell part of its

01:02:18.799 --> 01:02:24.739
 refineries and this is going to happen now and we are going to have new companies new companies

01:02:24.739 --> 01:02:29.479
 will appear not only on top of our noses not being sold but like others I on

01:02:29.479 --> 01:02:34.969
 next monday i will receive entrepreneurs who are interested in

01:02:34.969 --> 01:02:38.700
 build new refineries in Brazil because of what is happening

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:44.880
 presentão the expectation is this is one thing we are here in Breves Ilha

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:50.220
