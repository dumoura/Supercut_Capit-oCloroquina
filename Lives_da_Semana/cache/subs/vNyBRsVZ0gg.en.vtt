00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.980
in brasilia 16 de abril thursday 19 hours good night everyone here my side

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.680
 keep in mind our £ imtep elisângela to my right a person

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.370
 the already known successful people but perhaps not familiar with the you who

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:35.160
 ours with little owl doctor nelson tais da healthcare time-consuming

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.730
 today we are going to introduce you are going to say something today I had a conversation

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:51.300
 almost half an hour the doctor doctor a guetta where we talked a lot about

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:59.390
 oh yeah, let the health ministry thank you enough for your work

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:08.460
 point that didn’t really subscribe to the president’s idea was exactly the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.110
 concern also a collection of jobs in brazil

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.860
 a moment so as always i said with two is a patient with two

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.490
 serious problems here is the virus and the unemployment issue his line with the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.760
 doctor I respect her focused almost exclusively on the question of life

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.880
 know what's very important logically most important any

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.200
 something else but we know that the side effect of a very strict quarantine

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.800
 and doing what the most humble people and people can see

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.600
 your job or your livelihood in the case of informality could cause a problem

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.189
 very serious and of course brazil can reach a point

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:05.420
 of economy to be able to recover yet another adjusted economy we know that the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.620
 consequences also lead to doctor will talk in a little while is there is the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.590
 concern about the virus we never deny from there to the other hand we do not know that

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:26.750
 we must see to it that jobs do not continue to be destroyed by part of

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.000
 of a policy that in my understanding may not be in yours with a

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.530
 a little bit too strict for example it was neither one nor two is almost

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.280
 an acquaintance the 10 prisons of people to in public square

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.810
 men women, right, like on the beach in a bikini, being arrested by the police for

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.490
 municipal guard even by the military police carrying out orders from the mayor of the

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.720
 governor is already going on my part and would determine him imprisonment of whoever

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:04.340
 unless that person was, you know, a carrier of the disease

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:11.270
 then yes you have protection in the law outside that, then there are not only arbitrary arrests that

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.200
 hurt not to understand and the basic right guaranteed in the song

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.890
 don't let him come as well as your freedom you have to go the person only

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.760
 you can lose your freedom due to a projection, you know, because of a crime committed in the act

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.150
 crime that was not of these people, because there was no evidence that the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.130
 carrier of the virus so pass the word quickly here we will exchange

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.190
 an idea about all his work what will be redirected is going to be

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.180
 it will not be a stick horse that we are going to give this one

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.750
 on this issue but we understand that it actively with a lot of

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.249
 responsibility Brazil has to go back to work

00:03:56.249 --> 00:04:01.020
 now decision and will depart much more from governor and

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.160
 mayor than that was the decision of the federal supreme court was calling

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.850
 unanimously is the light of another and the panel is only a challenge we have already

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:21.239
 we have known since the time of the transition and now only accepted disappearance as her health

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:27.420
 knowing that you are not in a normal situation as if you had assumed and January

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:33.000
 last year is now the ministry itself that has to do with the lives of people with

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.100
 health and and also aggravated by one by a pandemic drop quite safe

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.320
 the era of what you will face ahead what is your opinion of what is

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.760
 costing brazil you can collaborate so that brazil not only love

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.990
 there are jobs, this is secondary, that's it, but you can't leave it, I'll forget it

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.610
 there is no way to do what people are no longer afraid to put in the virus

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:05.060
 if you bring the certain tranquility knowing that the virus can in some cases

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.160
 right people according to age according to diseases and even take

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.629
 oil my place I want to thank the present to

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:21.169
 opportunity to be here in the group helping to treat this serious problem

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:27.680
 for me an honor to be able to help the country help to see is

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.180
 and I see it in a way I’ve already commented several times I see it from

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.389
 a different way, right? I think we moved towards a separation between

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:47.300
 health and economy because here how do I see this is this as a whole understand the

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:52.789
 role of the health ministry has to be to bring health to people can

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:57.889
 look like [ __ ] I'm talking about but treating people is not the same as taking

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:03.320
 health provision health is a combination of many things it is a combination o

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.009
 that he calls the camille social determinants of health you be careful and

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:12.169
 health you will have economic stability you can have education for

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:17.419
 when you worry about bringing health and well-being to society you work

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:21.410
 health care but you have to work on several other things among

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:27.689
 they stability the economic part and education for example one thing

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:33.299
 and when you have a country that grows economically it drags with it the

00:06:33.299 --> 00:06:39.659
 growth of health education and the possibility to invest in something like

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:47.489
 infrastructure like sanitation this separation she is she is a is a

00:06:47.489 --> 00:06:52.679
 separation and real in fact because everything will influence the life span in

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:57.569
 quality of life and the well-being of society when I when I imagine

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:02.279
 taking care of the health of the people that we sometimes commit is not taking care of the disease

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:07.379
 just be careful this has to give both health and disease but it is a combination

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:11.909
 of many things and we will be there and it is very important for you to work more

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:15.809
 than the ministry is not only the ministry of health that will bring health

00:07:15.809 --> 00:07:19.499
 with the society the other ministries will participate in this is also important

00:07:19.499 --> 00:07:24.809
 this integration this alignment when you have is the things that depend on more

00:07:24.809 --> 00:07:27.700
 a ministry that sweats everything in an ad way

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.170
 and combined because everything that is done isolated everything that is done repeated everything

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:36.970
 that is fragmented ends up leading to inefficiency so when you have the

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:41.170
 resource we are a rich country i'm with how many months of course you

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:45.940
 have more efficient you have to have for you to take care of your health you will discuss

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.050
 health care and other things too so when when I discuss

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:55.960
 job when i listen to economics i think about the person i'm not thinking about this

00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:01.030
 looking at health I'm thinking about people in society and then you will

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:06.370
 have if you take it tighten the most humble part there is a person who loses a

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:11.500
 a job he will have less money to run his life to run the

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:17.200
 their children and it's hard for you sometimes not to be able to give a damn about your family

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.930
 we know how difficult it is for a

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:26.780
 and the father a mother who supports a family both with my strength here is to bring

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:31.910
 this view that I would say broad from that of health generation to a society

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:36.740
 including health care and specifically assessing the impact of each thing

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:41.599
 that happens in society whether in health or in the economy in the final result

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:45.080
 that the ability to care for people and help people to be healthy and

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:51.649
 well-being a simple example you have a decrease in economic activity and

00:08:51.649 --> 00:08:56.240
 you have - diagnostic services for example you may have a smaller number

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.140
 cancer diagnoses you may have less resources to treat the

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:05.600
 people and you will be able to have difficulty if you have financial difficulty if

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:09.500
 there will be something cardiovascular part if the person stays there in

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.040
 my emergency because she doesn’t have access because she’s scared it can

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.970
 increase cardiovascular mortality probably those numbers all of them

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:20.600
 have to pick up on the detail you have to be a line of work where you go

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:25.200
 understand a detail this information that if

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.850
 relate to what causes the problem related to care for the economy

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:34.680
 job but the second one has to be worked in a way without being combined

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:40.470
 and the problem is when you start to separate one thing from the other you start to

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:44.870
 bringing competition is something that should be collaboration

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:48.950
 is because even when you make some decisions you have to follow that

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.860
 decision that is that stays here it looks like it will happen exactly as you

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:56.180
 normally imagined you can never get it right you get it right

00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.740
 in a part you always have to make adjustments to life this is what you take are

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:05.690
 evaluate and revert relation to vale review this ability you can see quickly

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:10.430
 have information and take new policies and actions that will optimize the

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:15.589
 health and well-being of society that will make it possible for us to really achieve

00:10:15.589 --> 00:10:20.520
 improve the level of the individual of the people so that's the

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:26.850
 like this as well as I see how to take not only the ministry of health but

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.960
 a team that works for health that goes beyond the ministry of health and I

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:35.030
 I really hope to be able to deliver this [Music]

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:42.180
 for the president's society and for the product is let's say a little something, right

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:46.470
 because I was criticized a lot as if I had been exclusively concerned with

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:53.190
 an airport economy is functioning you have no way to take an organ to

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:57.480
 be transported and you brought the person who cannot help quickly

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.680
 A person who needs urgent medical care is not

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.830
 everything interconnected ok we know the responsibility

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:13.880
 and then with the gym in front of me, it’s on my back and that of the Minister of

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:20.510
 health we know that and we are not going to take the measures that have to be taken with a lot of

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:25.010
 responsibility with a lot of tranquility that take advantage of increase here greet

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:30.920
 here the young pan radio that was lying live a hug there augusto

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:37.730
 pains to zé maria two people that a much older right some flowers always

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:42.290
 firm in their positions this is very good that I got the excellent itself

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:47.540
 exceptional and the zé maria with a little younger that is in the same smooth as the

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:55.490
 some punctures of some are something else right I remember here his story is a doctor

00:11:55.490 --> 00:12:01.250
 in the pacific war is the soldier was injured episode of the transfusion that did not

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:06.470
 had continued until they started to apply coconut water for sale in

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:14.360
 and then in life, this discussion, of course, here can work, right, because I speak

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:18.200
 that can work we don't have the proof is it can be in a two

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.650
 years reach the scientific conclusion when it has not yet had validity

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:27.380
 none was was psychological but we can also come to the conclusion that it was

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:33.080
 Picasso and what I see in Brazil for many months applying the glue here on top of

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:38.450
 beads is a medicine that has been widely used to fight malaria

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:44.480
 sad and the light sold widely and special pharmacy in the northern region

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:50.390
 when people with malaria and gelaf are having it, right?

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:56.240
 has to help the verification of the front now that old story a person

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:00.950
 snake practice and you don't know if that serum will save you not what

00:13:00.950 --> 00:13:05.450
 is does it let the person die or apply the soil that can work this is what

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:11.280
 happens is an imposition my same decision to

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:17.880
 whoever it is is something that can be effective and we didn't understand i'm not a doctor

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:23.400
 but my understanding is to ask now that I’m doing business here, you can

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:30.420
 apply water with obviously the doctor's prescription answered how does

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:34.640
 I see the drugs they sent as proof of this book

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.780
 you create some criteria for use but you make it available for

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:45.090
 those people and that you believe the benefit can be greater than the

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:49.890
 harm which is a function so this is not only true of course here at praia da

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:53.130
 joaquina for other drugs being created

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:59.480
 this is what is important for us to bring today is the fastest way

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:05.490
 possible to understand this because when you don't have an accurate information this

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:10.020
 doubt opens the space for you to use the medicine even if you don’t have

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:13.320
 a certainty because what ends up happening that you have some

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:18.350
 indications that it works and others asks you some questions about

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:24.090
 on the effectiveness and toxicity this balance is up to you

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:30.180
 make it available when you think it might be working here in situations today

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:34.290
 as it is a more critical situation the person is more likely to die here

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:38.250
 can be use and you see people using it actually when you have a lot of

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.880
 uncertainty and fear will drive that too then

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:46.470
 be it and you put it in the doctor's hand you today I already put the

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:51.210
 doctor has aa he will make that choice he will take responsibility

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:58.080
 but I think that our role today is to make sure that this solution is

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:04.470
 faster based on the most accurate and reliable data from studies

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:10.980
 with several studies here and I believe that this will see a space

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.980
 see her for fun because you will need to wait this long you talked

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:19.530
 it will come faster another ring just found it gave your opinion take a

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:26.070
 message for the Brazilian of tranquility will be cautious is also

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:30.240
 something that and everyone says almost unanimously right

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:37.080
 that sixty percent of Brazilians have already been or will be infected and from

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:42.570
 of that moment and here we can see from saying that

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:47.400
 we are free of the virus in view of this large percentage of people and having

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:52.620
 antibodies is a message is to take care of the elderly who have as their

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:58.230
 right skill and other people also take due care but not

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:06.510
 need to panic if it becomes contaminated, you know how I think

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:11.130
 that we know that young people usually have less behavior

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:14.700
 Aggressive people may be more asymptomatic although you now have an

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:22.970
 25 right people eating by the doctor not elderly but it is

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:27.500
 is what we have to pay attention to is as follows I am looking at the number of

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:35.259
 people who today in Brazil had the diagnosis are blessed that you

00:16:35.259 --> 00:16:40.620
 multiply by giving this and this population today does not give way for

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.870
 percent of the conversation and if you think that this can

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:47.620
 represent in any way and related to have fifty sixty per

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:52.180
 percent of having already had contact with the virus is already somehow the viewer and very

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:57.670
 used on the continent may have died this distance is very large what

00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:01.210
 worries today is the following for you to discuss the fact that you can have the

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:06.280
 second in the third wave this really far away people today is very low and you

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:10.089
 imagine according to the scientific guidelines question of growing a lot

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:15.250
 higher and today you already have a hard time not being economic but social

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:19.209
 when we would do it economically, think of money but it’s the skill it’s the

00:17:19.209 --> 00:17:23.680
 possibility lets us interact and we have a normal life so you can get out

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:26.829
 from your home talking to meeting the people you care about with your friends and

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:32.650
 other places this goes beyond employment this goes in relation to everyday life

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:38.080
 of people so this is us and yours was now we have to have a focus

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:42.020
 very high in quality what is the prevalence of

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:46.720
 the woman incidence prevalence of this disease be it of the infected or of the

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.960
 healed the going so data that they died when you combine that data on

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.310
 it will be much easier for us to see what happens when designing policies

00:17:55.310 --> 00:18:00.650
 at this point we will probably not be able to be

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:04.670
 completely wrong but we are going to have a situation in which we hardly

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:08.870
 will arrive at that number of theoretically would give an immunity that a

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:13.160
 society and we will have to discuss how the life of the people will be

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.090
 people learn to discuss I talked about life's discussion tell you about you

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:20.870
 need employment economics got a little something can give a little connotation

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:24.890
 marked but here i'm talking about how you are people's lives and then you

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:31.370
 everything is related to isolation and job detachment everything helps me from

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:37.400
 government the hour and what is left said the following collected the data see the

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.970
 behavior see what's happening to people calmly

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:44.789
 automations day and this we will have to walk

00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:49.409
 in this direction and we will have to have the comfort of understanding that each

00:18:49.409 --> 00:18:53.279
 day we will have walked again that will help us to understand better and to take

00:18:53.279 --> 00:18:57.330
 decisions for tomorrow I thought well I also thank the channel but Brazil

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:03.379
 28 thousand of us live with 95 thousand of the gazeta radio Jovem Pan also

00:19:03.379 --> 00:19:09.349
 something else is good okay guys one day quite tiring for all of us

00:19:09.349 --> 00:19:14.429
 it is not easy to make decisions but the evaluation time

00:19:14.429 --> 00:19:21.600
 good and it's military jargon right worse than a bad decision is an indecision so

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:26.759
 we know we can make mistakes when I said here can make mistakes but we will

00:19:26.759 --> 00:19:31.190
 seek to do the best for Brazil the law that we won win this one soon

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:36.269
 this stage is not yet known if the number of deaths in Brazil will increase

00:19:36.269 --> 00:19:41.279
 but it is a reality, we have to face this one, we ask for a special

00:19:41.279 --> 00:19:47.820
 attention to the families in brazil who take your grandpa my mom is being taken care of by

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:52.679
 my brothers there in the riverside vase a very special treatment that people

00:19:52.679 --> 00:19:58.619
 yes if you came to buy the viruses do not have difficulties they may need

00:19:58.619 --> 00:20:03.980
 medical care, which is very complex, so it treats sometimes the

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:08.419
 people, if possible, isolated people who took them home in a corner and the

00:20:08.419 --> 00:20:14.660
 it was okay, very good, okay, and this pandemic will overcome this some

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:21.590
 countries already practically see third a lot of pain a lot of sacrifice hobby ok

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:29.299
 we will win this too and reduce whatever it is we don't want to lose a decision

00:20:29.299 --> 00:20:35.970
 ours decrease as much as possible this number of eggs but peace tranquility

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:42.150
 and this will pass God is with us here in Brazil I believe in men and women

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:46.590
 who are by our side in the most varied special ministries now that

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:53.670
 has mobile weaknesses our ministry of health thank you very much to all and even the

00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:57.770
 next Thursday would be straightforward
