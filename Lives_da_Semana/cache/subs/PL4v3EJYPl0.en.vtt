 army formed by the military academy of the black needles in my general mood

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.990
 yesterday we had a tragedy in the world

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.270
 cyclone seems to have led hundreds of people to

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.380
 death in addition to destroying much of it is the one let's say to the president he

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.890
 use we carry out a situation of them we make available immediately

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.110
 recognized heads said they also took all when away to do any

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.450
 question that passing before passing also on the African continent was

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.790
 sensitized with our phone somebody say something to do nothing

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.970
 wanna remember shock we had a peace mission in that country in the 90's

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.190
 last century and it was where we started the transformation a lot

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.840
 substantial taking with it extreme professionalism from our

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.209
 forces and pays net in poison which is an icon in the peacekeepers as first

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.530
 commander is the commanding general of minustah

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:21.360
 there in haiti well just arrived in the united states it was a very

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.410
 profitable we were received very well the government

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:34.140
 North American private meeting with him is going to come in and it was your ideas of

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.790
 marina, the municipality decided to invite its son eduardo because the son

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.920
 I will invite you and a reference to that country so that the meeting of some

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.090
 reservation issues were from the cup the peace in life flag said I went in there

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:59.489
 was serving to discredit our health chancellor school floor

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.439
 brand guard already knew that he was not only there, he worked in the region

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:08.819
 lepa could take immediate solution just select has nothing to do

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.739
 I always take care of the evil in question, so it is something that

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:19.500
 was doing something abnormal going over the agenda but still

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.130
 I have part of the media here as well as on Sunday

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.080
 morning a schedule that would have worked out the day before

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.669
 the company arrived and wondered how long it will be on Sunday on Monday

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.729
 famous fair visit american there in the headline a company in brazil is that we

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.560
 it was already discredited to visit Syria before visiting the

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.590
 ingenuity has nothing to do with this technology this has no foundation to

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.720
 me is direct advisor to the president president is the main client of ami

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:01.650
 so he has been there every day close to him and he will visit me is an activity and

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:08.250
 will be very well received but it doesn’t have the importance they wanted to give because the

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.889
 he belongs to me he is the big customer of

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.940
 information exchange

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:40.150
 eduardo shopping and a barbecue hat is a gay european robot not me

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:45.790
 invited ok you are right now they have the right to pass the rain since the elaboration of

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.440
 may not interest anyone, the girl will know how the dog that already

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.690
 happened to me I had a hot dog or button on a trip around Brazil

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.970
 when I was away it would be more opportune for azulay time correction

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.600
 with watering the trip was spectacular we signed the

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.030
 marks some agreements for example of the launch center of alcântara

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:14.590
 look this agreement has been around for almost 20 years you know what to do in the world that

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.540
 it will actually happen the government of the left it if it prefers to make a deal

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.870
 with ukraine i believe i was fine as to

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:28.690
 russia later has a problem and this agreement didn’t go ahead with

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:34.840
 cane invest in the case another 1 billion reais to sadia that was lost and now

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.650
 the opportunity arose so what do we do something like it too

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:46.420
 we can launch material right from other countries not just from the state I don't agree

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:54.580
 it was perfect all possible problems were taken away and now we depend

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.800
 here basically the chamber's foreign affairs commissions and also

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.090
 of the federal senate is for us to re-enter if we don’t put

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.890
 to run alcantara base and we have a great time and I really always

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:14.770
 enjoy one more thing with regard to today we have a problem we are still in

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:20.220
 ways of resolving the cohesion of the community that praised this issue also injury

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:27.390
 the surgeon more things and we want to offer quilombolas a job there

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:32.340
 that I used to sing time with her work now that area is oversized

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.090
 and problems appear and some already speak up to us not

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:40.830
 we agree with that right and send it to another place the base is the pipe until difficult

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:45.120
 the quilombola issue we all have to gain from the base

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.240
 functioning of the Alcântara launch center were the

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:53.520
 quilombolas also Brazil and the world also if the thing doesn’t like the laughter

00:07:53.520 --> 00:08:00.240
 everything is to give some fear about vivian have been questioned a lot in the

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:05.220
 event the question of our country's sovereignty over the space center of

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:08.730
 alcântara just as the team started to win

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:14.130
 that region and use a metaphor is as follows you have an apartment you

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:18.510
 rent an apartment to someone you own the apartment and when you

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:22.740
 you can ask the person who rented the apartment to do a

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:27.060
 inspection of the apartment so absolutely no demand

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:32.610
 about the sovereignty of brazil in this matter another idea is also that we

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:38.669
 we need to take advantage of the moment that exists in the global launching scope

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:44.159
 of satellites that soon this space is occupied and that point that is

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:50.339
 exceptional only point of view is lower cost location

00:08:50.339 --> 00:08:55.589
 will not allow us to use earning financial dividends or dividends

00:08:55.589 --> 00:08:59.030
 technological safeguard agreements

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:05.520
 technological developments that have been in view from the point of view our inflated treats

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:10.560
 exactly that is so big is a big step that we take in

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:16.830
 direction to position itself in the spatial scope with

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:21.780
 the alcântara space center another issue on the agenda she was the possibility

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:28.770
 Brazil being part of a select group is a great ally for this NATO, which comes to

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:34.230
 be that there is the demand for a top are treated north look at the countries in one of

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:39.420
 stores are part of this self-defense group, that is, with the country for

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:45.330
 fortunately the countries are attacked unfairly is that act an aggression to

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:51.090
 himself and soon after he said that more than that I don't even want to put it on the altar

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:57.090
 even he intends to modify the statute not so much to lead to the appreciation of the

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:03.870
 other partners for brazil to have effectively in this nato circle is

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:09.900
 this is really important for us and we need to stop this

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:15.600
 history of everything you try to do in terms of agreement whether commercial or

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:21.900
 scientific agreement is economic agreement in the united states it always seems that we

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:27.360
 we are giving up our sovereignty it is silly it is only a mongrel complex

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.770
 our students visit already 23 visits with the present season like the book in

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:37.260
 different functions than the one I have today is the nani who has been following

00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.430
 this visit regularly the treatment that was given to the Brazilian delegation

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:48.630
 this time it was completely different, even the friendliness was surprising

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:54.450
 reception of the present throne and also there what was advanced in the kilo was

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:58.710
 talked to the state in which there was this series of relevant issues that

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:02.880
 had equal treatment does not stop with this story of finding

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:07.500
 anything that happens in the united states includes about it and I don't know that

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:16.329
 has nothing of total leisure jewelry with absolute exemption

00:11:16.329 --> 00:11:23.499
 our visit and praise all that we can do in agreement

00:11:23.499 --> 00:11:28.869
 in addition to agreement is not even partnerships and other issues were

00:11:28.869 --> 00:11:35.350
 placed at the table in a verbal manner so that in the future we can better treat

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:40.629
 matters that interest ours I can take the company gives inside the edno

00:11:40.629 --> 00:11:44.230
 he is also a member of the foreign affairs and national defense commission of

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:49.329
 chamber that is not the focus of our conscious vote for brazil

00:11:49.329 --> 00:11:53.379
 on these issues another song that some talked about here in Brazil there are others

00:11:53.379 --> 00:11:58.989
 agreeing is a visa waiver agreement there is no reciprocity

00:11:58.989 --> 00:12:04.869
 so at first you learn yes so the american can go they react

00:12:04.869 --> 00:12:11.139
 business where tourism is exempt from visas due to a criticism of the press that would leave

00:12:11.139 --> 00:12:15.069
 to raise in this difficult position all 60 million reais per year

00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:19.660
 but certainly with the flow of people it was very big here with all

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.169
 certainty in the visa exemption for tourism and business

00:12:23.169 --> 00:12:27.910
 they’ll leave billions in here who conquered lose a lot and holy -

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:32.470
 I promise I lost the difficult election and I arrested him quietly after he signaled

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:37.509
 the possibility for a group of Brazilians to start it also the exemption

00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:42.910
 visa at first I understand that this is very welcome and if the thing

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:49.089
 on visa exemption students came to see if this is the visa issue

00:12:49.089 --> 00:12:55.470
 is another thing that is quite clear is it is the countries that interest us

00:12:55.470 --> 00:13:00.960
 the visa exemption because they will bring tourism fruits is a 'gift' of the campaign o

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:06.750
 tourism is necessarily and necessarily a source of income

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:10.980
 inexhaustible some countries in the world practically live from cross tourism

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.750
 spain was when he sang drug isn't it

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:20.370
 inconceivable that a country with the beauties of brazil has naturals with potential

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:24.690
 has in the political area that we do not have the attitude to improve the

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:29.160
 situation of the president tourism environment always showing up and we need to put

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:40.620
 not even improve our public safety, even to include it in Brazil

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:46.010
 that traditional is one of those kroes in guinea that will criticize that demanded

00:13:46.010 --> 00:14:00.180
 counterpart I don't think that way and people have a different view we

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:08.490
 we are together in this culture I have never seen any American he

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:12.060
 worked another touch of labor guarantee in the organism

00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:23.640
 the people there without any guarantee without any clt work happier here

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:34.430
 with more security and everything else that brings us closer to countries that the subject

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:47.700
 so we have a decree recently signed here about new ones to hire and the

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.580
 commissioned we ended up being able to sing this year 20 thousand

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:55.540
 cars there is a commitment we saw 21 thousand

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:59.560
 and here on my side vagner used by the minister in whatever is going to talk about

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:04.150
 this decree is going to hire those famous Brazilian commissioners

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:12.430
 10 the week trust post the president signed decree 9 727 a

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:15.280
 decree that brings book criteria for the occupation of administration positions

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.420
 public the decree that he has an old man is very

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:23.710
 important for both preventing corruption and improving management

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:28.290
 public logically decree he brings is criteria

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:34.540
 linked to more moral aspects of the past that person then the

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:38.710
 person may be involved in either case

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:43.420
 provided for in the clean sheet law already has a reputation for bars are the criteria

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:48.420
 general and then we have specific criteria that they increase from

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:53.170
 degradation according to the moment in the car that does not rule out the criteria of the dance

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:58.240
 2 or 3 after a wave of those four and then with 10 5 and 6 we have

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:03.030
 sure that this measure is very important and will improve the delivery of

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:08.260
 delivery as they want to do the citizen and this is going to be a big step for the

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:12.550
 increasing professionalization of good bidding to avoid

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:18.910
 we caught hundreds and penalized people who even he didn’t believe

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:26.020
 and there are so many people that you stay if you don't have the lawsuit against the business

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:32.080
 absurd the disregard for these positions will be filled in brasília whether it is called

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:35.200
 for the federal government some state companies is

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:41.650
 the only tragedy of him leaving the present in the modified decree afterwards and generated is

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:46.090
 only this obligation to comply with the decision, including those nominated to

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:49.570
 from his input since the first one so let's go all the courses

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:53.230
 are preparing documentation for all appointments will be used and

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:57.760
 those who do not meet the requirements are out of the wind and we are going to put the governments

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.500
 previous ones up there the squid back there squid dilma and so many others

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:06.670
 take advantage that since the routine also collects is that you will use this

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:11.160
 doing here he called the chief minister of da ceja the

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:16.449
 took advantage of arriving had already scheduled even the president returns on saturday

00:17:16.449 --> 00:17:21.040
 i stay with millions the second time it was the second he must sign a

00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.820
 agreement with the general secretary of the presidency of the republic of chile which is

00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:29.590
 responsible in an area responsible for the country and corruption transparency arc

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:33.640
 we are all going to sign an information exchange agreement from the Chilean government

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:37.840
 pass a complete system that they developed which is a base of the contour

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.770
 the agenda for the regulation of the lobby is not going so let's take this material

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:47.620
 all over Brazil and there will be an exchange of information with all the scenarios of

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:51.910
 corruption and transparency and control and I am sure that the partnership with the

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:55.090
 best practices from both brazil and chico s

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:58.300
 with this exchange of information exchange that we are going to do the two countries have

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:03.550
 a lot of land our presence here is also justified here we go only

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:08.200
 organism could breathe treated various subjects and prepare the environment in the

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:13.600
 ground for an entourage our economy visit chile chile the folks here

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:17.340
 of the work so that we can deepen our

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:22.350
 our budget is commercial here is also another head of state should

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:25.830
 present everything is all right so that in argentina colombia ecuador paraguay

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:31.380
 peru be here head of state on the issue of unasur which is the fancy name

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:35.730
 in the sheet of são paulo it was not just the ball to want a group created

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:43.049
 in the 90s with several different actors here in south america squid to treat

00:18:43.049 --> 00:18:48.450
 of what is that big deal that countries before left entity as

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:52.620
 for example the FARC terrorist group was also part of that group, the band

00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:57.990
 space at that moment is also a beach so it’s the two countries and helping each other

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:02.760
 so that all of them could one day reach the presidency and transform the

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:08.070
 south america ac in the great bolivarian homeland of brazil and venezuela grande

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:12.270
 an institutional relationship seeking to worsen

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:16.890
 you can't understand it is an institution that is looking to improve the countries of the

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:20.010
 south america until it reaches the level of cuba and venezuela

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:22.980
 so I'm going to put an end to the subject that has always been the fantasy name

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:29.370
 from são paulo maybe create what would be next unfortunate there an entity

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:32.250
 that is not that the financial contribution to anyone

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:39.200
 differently here at unasur and the important thing is that we have a cause of

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:46.640
 pravaler democracy differently from that of unasur

00:19:47.929 --> 00:20:04.020
 whoever can buy pepe mujica's book the former president of power in 1981 was the

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:11.600
 plot that brazil and uruguay of summer to remove the paraguayan from the mercosur

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:17.030
 maybe she can sit and he says of the water there and dilma rousseff was taking

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:20.870
 state decisions within the palace of the plateau

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:26.919
 listening to the Cuban intelligences and venice nothing I am here already in the second book

00:20:26.919 --> 00:20:32.900
 advised by abin to what point brazil was coming

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:41.299
 for a similar regime in venezuela then a miracle is known or it is also the

00:20:41.299 --> 00:20:47.570
 ankle to milena ramos and there are a lot of people who say they know everything a lot

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:51.590
 important in politics with financial resources television time is certain

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:57.289
 we achieved the victory above even where electronics that in the streets

00:20:57.289 --> 00:21:04.640
 project beforehand that the regions can actually be edited in the gold that this

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:09.380
 now also there would be no way to help if I think one just remember that we had

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:13.880
 a lot of people back a lot following it would be very difficult to cheat on top

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:18.919
 we didn’t get there is so great that my condition as a god putting people

00:21:18.919 --> 00:21:25.250
 good competent relative to be able to exist a job when he passed away in

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:35.000
 2000 the same year and in the other preventive form being arrested because that

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.110
 person is basically by the way of seeking governance is very common

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:43.220
 in some states in some city halls if you do the same thing the head of the

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:47.090
 executive speaking about the president of airvo no

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:52.909
 offers petrobras he goes down extra bank of brazil tais and

00:21:52.909 --> 00:21:56.720
 ministries in exchange for support what happens in the future develop now

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:02.690
 authorities arrests in addition to state inefficiency and corruption

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:11.410
 part of the genetic company of the blow he is not listening to parliament

00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:15.400
 in fact I would like the plan to say whatever what I have to

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.550
 do for governance you will talk to parliamentarians from

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:25.060
 to start I believe that most of them are in agreement with the

00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:32.430
 our proposal is to say if someone has a floor it is better than the knee in the

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:42.580
 design and athletic it was better that you are going to use it to be also better than the

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:47.440
 our tarcísio that the presence captain well done he is tendered from the chamber

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:55.210
 federal deputy was born exactly she improves square is is teresa analyst

00:22:55.210 --> 00:23:00.820
 cristina is not a compliment from germany on traffic day that day

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:05.170
 in sign that I was on the right path complemented by cristina who on the day of

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:10.990
 yesterday through milligan was revoked two normative instructions that allowed

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:18.490
 brazil importing bands from ecuador since 2014 visited mother joana 10 thousand t

00:23:18.490 --> 00:23:25.840
 love whose phytosanitary inspection was done with ecuador and walked 10,000 km

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:29.770
 channel for walking is a position and climbing the mountain

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:36.460
 it is difficult to understand for example there is a concern in a competitive way

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:40.780
 only the people in the valley of the ribeira and culture of brazil

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:49.309
 this Tuesday the problems and the banana fruit in the black sigatoka den

00:23:49.309 --> 00:23:53.720
 it seems like all the problems it was difficult for us to get out was made from

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:59.779
 thing in the dilma rousseff government lacked respect when we go to get

00:23:59.779 --> 00:24:04.190
 making partnerships in other areas but there were people it was really difficult

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:12.500
 understand this is just more mattered nanas that way the equator well come

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:22.070
 here it was massacred today on tv globe the fans of approval i said in the first

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:29.179
 mandate of former Indian hawks president i want to tell all of you that decides to

00:24:29.179 --> 00:24:33.110
 training has the same credibility as the electoral polls

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:38.149
 remember that last year merit talked about the map i would lose all

00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:57.770
 world jumped 20 years accompanies learning a lot and is 100% there is to discuss

00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:03.830
 is an important topic in parliament I'm talking about because he knows that now

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:06.940
 has a lot of output

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:24.700
 the luck is that i can believe in songs the head recalls without

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:31.690
 discrimination without you have two cows well trained and georgia the proposal

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:35.950
 of the military's welfare I said that time there and then the

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:38.890
 black rodrigo maia said the same thing right

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:41.799
 have to take into account not only was it presented now

00:25:41.799 --> 00:25:46.900
 but what was also showing his government

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:55.600
 the hatter of fernando henrique cardoso and saw a provisional measure that the number

00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:01.870
 10 currently there are 22 15 today is not an agent was December 2000 when

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:07.990
 world has nothing to do but lnt 2215 that withdrew all military rights but he

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:13.270
 all the military and even more at that time a discussion was being

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:18.640
 pension plan similar to those that happened was to approve just one measure

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:22.120
 provisional some military the rest will be out

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:26.590
 it will not take into account and make a serious analysis of what has been proposed now

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:31.210
 have to take into account also to present in 2000 that was not voted until today

00:26:31.210 --> 00:26:35.500
 can speak but he was not found today he is a counselor to mindu million

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:41.830
 changed the way in which measures were taken in the victory even Jorge and from that

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:51.159
 At the moment the measure the previous companies are frozen and they would be in

00:26:51.159 --> 00:26:55.059
 effective until congress the vote as the federal government

00:26:55.059 --> 00:26:59.950
 if I cover remove the animal was invented delivered almost half the year

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:04.020
 past if we need that power for us

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:09.600
 in this provisional measure so far the 300% to vote for all of them

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:14.760
 we can be irresponsible to that point but take into account that it was that we lost

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:22.080
 but still fighting for rights here, article 71 of the population talks about rights

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:35.010
 the time here we do not want to deal with this matter the

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:39.420
 your loved ones is something very special that has a value

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:49.400
 huge for democracy - I think it is wrong that guarantees the dictatorship

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:56.760
 are from the armed forces of 2000 generals who managed to promote in which they are

00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:02.570
 fully committed to the country and urged Saturday

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:06.680
 unfortunately can't get out of this situation

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:25.880
 about the feeling that is happening

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:35.040
 particularly i think it would be welcome but there is the impact is not a

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:41.030
 information but created is not in the circle of

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:47.020
 the virus with great force is the participation of all of us is a gift

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:52.960
 everybody here - found the will use the conclusion that had to be withdrawn and

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:58.690
 he is still under study who knows the future is if there is really interest

00:28:58.690 --> 00:29:04.510
 of the force and after the war it took after the information to be well worked in the

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:08.980
 ahead of us to present the proposal to create the figure of nos

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:14.620
 helped the participation of the ego a lot, it was also important, thus giving its

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:21.160
 opinion in a very modest way on the issue of reforming the proposed

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:27.160
 pension reform has already been called upon to say something personal put exactly

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.880
 the essential points i would like to reinforce that society

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:35.800
 armed forces have hierarchy and discipline as their parameter, and then the one that always

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:42.160
 need to be all the time so thought of any other issues and it was

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:47.110
 this is the one that disciplines from the orientation of the leadership of the

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:52.470
 our president made it very clear that any decision of mine and I use any

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:56.320
 military didn't take it alone until I can get it wrong

00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:01.060
 you have to be responsible, it is obvious that you wait longer you may find that the table

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:07.780
 with a great importance ok but the importance of the newest venice

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:13.750
 that deals with the family thing, human rights and I talk a lot with her

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:19.060
 doing exceptional work there in your ministry will use the same

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:24.400
 anything any of that when it will have started by tarcísio structure

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:29.560
 the conclusion of br 163 in pará passed the carnival there i went there to see what is

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:34.419
 happening in the first 40 when the cbboxe was never mugged is a

00:30:34.419 --> 00:30:43.090
 conversion combo that uses the fernando defense is ending the chut the month of

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:47.289
 May cause of rain the army will come with everything there to miss it and if

00:30:47.289 --> 00:30:54.010
 this little want help has a lot of this to what is produced there in the west center

00:30:54.010 --> 00:31:00.340
 our job is this is to talk and I would come to the conclusion that we can be

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:03.940
 done everything developed to be able to do everything will be done

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:08.019
 logically you know we're broken right is ours is a debt

00:31:08.019 --> 00:31:13.029
 44 trillion reais of rain range I for years living in a small

00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:16.539
 male the one who rebuilt europe after the second world war

00:31:16.539 --> 00:31:21.909
 we have the problem of the swelling of seducing a place i can speak for the government

00:31:21.909 --> 00:31:25.779
 federal government in many states that have municipal programs that also have

00:31:25.779 --> 00:31:28.960
 problems and from there it comes to pension reform and the

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.769
 fund I would not like to do a pension but if I did I would be

00:31:32.769 --> 00:31:38.889
 being and acting irresponsibly and on Sunday 21 and 22 Brazil will stop if the

00:31:38.889 --> 00:31:42.669
 end of this reform unfortunately this is approved once

00:31:42.669 --> 00:31:47.440
 approved in a way that will help all of Brazil it will charge - who earns less

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:54.669
 the more he earns the more he will perform until the fame of the social security will give a suitcase

00:31:54.669 --> 00:32:00.100
 very good in this matter and continuous act is as agreed with paulo guedes the

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:06.730
 rondon's idea is an excellent team of economists being taken will

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:11.559
 accelerating possession was the first that is god by organization is to have the weight of

00:32:11.559 --> 00:32:18.809
 been on top of those who produce is doing everything possible to leave street ecology here

00:32:18.809 --> 00:32:23.559
 freely these are two squares which is difficult is

00:32:23.559 --> 00:32:28.570
 patron brazil is this project is the boss is more difficult

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:33.580
 if you take this then this car has no right none of us have we are already

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:38.980
 in the fourth social revolution increasingly demands more in intellectual training and will

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:45.039
 get the job and our education is going badly I don't want it dead or the problem is resolved

00:32:45.039 --> 00:32:54.940
 education issue but we are doing what we can with the parable hello friends

00:32:54.940 --> 00:33:01.570
 you can be sure that we will run the vote of confidence with brazil for real

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:06.960
 with this right psd let's put brazil on the right track

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:16.779
 thank you all so much for dinner now the lawyer starts again elisângela will speak

00:33:16.779 --> 00:33:21.549
 also on pension reform is not pension reform is a new

00:33:21.549 --> 00:33:26.320
 social security, as Paulo guedes has insisted, those who have already

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:32.200
 any witness's speech the seriousness because it was planned

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:36.730
 I would like to make a patriotic appeal to parliamentarians

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:41.350
 and that part of the press that you’ve always criticized takes over the exchange of

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:50.049
 favors that from now on make an examination of European conscience to publish

00:33:50.049 --> 00:33:55.389
 news without comments comment the need not to help

00:33:55.389 --> 00:34:00.580
 this concept in Brazil this is something that we have almost common is cultural

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:04.840
 we have an obligation to change that the press can help a lot

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:11.319
 need to act patriotic mind showing what is happening for this exchange

00:34:11.319 --> 00:34:16.000
 of favors taken in case we don't go back to ours we got there

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.800
 relevant information at the congress we will take advantage and we will make a new

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:25.750
 presidency that is the big step for a new brazil

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:32.100
 thank you very much everyone a good night and until thursday of next week
