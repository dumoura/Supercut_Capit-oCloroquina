silva questioned there says to deflect conditioning

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:28.099
 it's good night thursday december 2nd 2020 january and caused pain january

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.750
 2020 was worth the committee is smart the devourer

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.910
 of tilapia is that the first batch of the year last year you were the one that most

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.570
 everyone called it zero, that is, look not only if I am well accompanied in the

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.460
 on the left here our fabiano flamenguista how does the hive

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:58.010
 flemish that flemish gorge the jorge whenever the secretary of fisheries

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:07.539
 also worth of purple belford borgo course also accompanied all the

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.460
 first goal of the year I want to thank all of you

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:21.500
 followed and during Sunday 19 a lot of anger 50 but tomorrow is that

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.090
 we got it is just the day telling you I was on a trip I was on the air not

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.729
 it was possible to do is most sought after in the best way to stay informed

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:39.229
 under discussion it is important the fundão mil divided right vetoes or sanctions because the

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:47.509
 that you would do in the place we’re going to arrive but it’s ok, it’s all resolved

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.880
 economy is doing great thanks to god

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.030
 the press and when the party is a news that in the last days there and

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:03.079
 of the system the level of employment in four years invest two locations double and scholarship

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:11.870
 rises 32 percent and nineteen stock exchange rises 31 and a half percent in the year and analysts

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.820
 see new high in 2020

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:22.400
 I speak minimum 39 increased 39 reais I will have on my page criticism

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.960
 asking me what I would do will live with the minimum wage is to recognize

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.670
 the difficulty recognizes the difficulty of those who live on a minimum wage but

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.470
 we have to recover the economy otherwise it complicates the situation the year

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.820
 past we have paid interest and debt repayments over 400

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.770
 billion reais plus 1 billion a day of interest really the country

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:52.010
 it is not easy for you to manage a country with this monstrous debt, it is not that we

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.800
 we have now because it reached such a high value what do we what justifies us

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.570
 we pay more than a billion interest a day what has been done in the past where

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:09.110
 invested in a response to our economic team but to a large extent

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.130
 jorge the selic rate was up

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.830
 if the Selic rate was fought last year if inflation is fought by increasing the team

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:26.150
 uses beat 60% which 60% of the fhc government so the domestic debt grew

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.670
 frighteningly okay the problem is there we have

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.480
 that honoring commitments before loses credibility because brazil has recovered

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.050
 since the last year, it has been recovering exactly its credibility and

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:52.280
 Selic rate is 46 percent started at 4% this year the forecast we pay from

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.540
 July next year - symptoms of 110 billion reais

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.650
 is a tremendous relief in the public accounts work of the economic team of the

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:08.269
 polo guedes is from roberto campos there in central is from pedro guimarães not in

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.489
 savings account is due to the theft at the bank of brazil and so we go on touching the

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:19.640
 boat here who have the economy are they and delegated this responsibility to the

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.880
 mister paulo Guerra and his team that the numbers are showing you are doing

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.260
 A good job

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:34.720
 well and curiosity grew here the registration of firearms in brazil in the

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:41.020
 past I could not go beyond my decrees and ordinance

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.460
 in this case in addition to the army commander who cannot

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:52.110
 beyond the law so what we call providence with decrees and ordinances

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.919
 allow the growth of firearms

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:05.500
 is around 22% compared to 2 percent and crime criminality has decreased the

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.220
 your state already santa catarina i think a safer state in brazil being that

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:17.020
 is also one of the most has is people with legal weapons as well is is gyms

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.580
 magnetism is the seven detained foreigner is right club admitting it will come out

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:29.050
 so more than concrete proof that the quantity was legal in the hands of the people

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:36.100
 has an inverse relationship to the number of deaths well the jorge to whom he will speak

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.680
 some topics quickly and he didn't even have time to talk to him before he started

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.099
 very fast when it comes to fishing so it seems to be driving a little bit here

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:48.729
 sir for what it looks like the brazilian sometimes

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:53.620
 want to consume fish but do not know how to prepare the thousand exactly quickly

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.860
 say something personal we are at the secretary good night the

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.460
 captain first thank you for participating in the first hour of the year and the

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.150
 tribute to our fishing and aquaculture nothing better a way of thanking

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:12.789
 give you a kiss it's true ready it was creepy guys we are

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:17.500
 a quick survey of an entity from são paulo showed that the housewife

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.450
 that preparing food in most Brazilian homes have doubts about the

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.510
 freshness does not know how to buy does not know how to prepare

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:30.789
 so we are going to do a kind of masterchef brazil and the name of the program

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:35.889
 you are going to give is collaborating there our social networks and we will

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:39.949
 prepare recipes themselves when housewives helping

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:44.569
 housewives preparing this wonderful food for all Brazilians

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:48.800
 captain advertising your son here 06 our social people here

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.839
 people participate there we will make a poll for you to give the name o

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:58.129
 master plate program obviously already from a tv station and participate that in

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:04.039
 soon we will have news I prepared everything when last there was a lunch

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:08.599
 tambaquis exactly what came from rondônia is exactly the positive reflection

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:14.149
 that lunch that is three times increased the sale of tambaqui according to

00:07:14.149 --> 00:07:19.729
 entity to be credited that they prepare so passionate involves the tambaqui that

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:24.199
 I took a boy here, so let the 15 kilos be the same beautiful thing

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:29.029
 some investigated or torture and the fish hit asphyxiated joke right

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:33.249
 all right next to the boat is to think I don't know what to eat right

00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:39.979
 by cob pejão eats meat with vegetables and that is in force in the summer so everything arrives

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:45.529
 well let's go playing the boat there is saving money at petrobras banco do

00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:53.119
 brasil eletrobras had record profit this year 28 for 6 billion well above

00:07:53.119 --> 00:07:58.550
 2001 just above 2008 now what happens is to put it is to look for

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:04.309
 get the right person back to the right place there are things that still have to be changed

00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:09.559
 and the current ones are slow, we are looking for these solutions in but not

00:08:09.559 --> 00:08:17.209
 there is more on the part of the executive what was recently in Brazil here the

00:08:17.209 --> 00:08:22.659
 people go back to state-owned companies so that people who are not

00:08:22.659 --> 00:08:30.669
 partly on Wednesdays the author would do the thing that had to be done and not

00:08:30.669 --> 00:08:35.769
 operate for groups that I had indicated there

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:42.100
 the biggest loss of this rate recorded 2015 2015 because that was the president squid

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:48.370
 coincidence is where the scandals at the state-owned company began to potentiate

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:58.930
 special to petrobras this ended the bnds also the data of

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:03.850
 first quarter of this year had a history profit of r 11 billion

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:07.060
 is a sign that obeys a slap on the hands

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:12.280
 of people like in the pt government back there that the best known case was the

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:19.660
 jbs friboi i usually say right 2014 a little bit to jbs

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:24.520
 borrowed 9 billion reais from Benin and five percent of that

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:31.480
 approximately 400 and a few million here at that time, you know, which 5 per

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:38.530
 percent said repeating 400 few 1 billion not millions on 9 bi 5 by

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:43.240
 percent with shares and a few million was given to political parties and

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.920
 political parties distribute this budget among their candidates 1,400 few yet

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:55.030
 was not voted on the account the party had 200 thousand euros I became the lion

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:59.740
 gave a check back leaving and asked the party to vote against that fund

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:04.240
 at that time it brings in the normal campaign fund so yes but it is developed

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.680
 for a terrible scandal there and if I used the day at that time

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:12.700
 him being cool is not cool for sure i was going to tried it head on but everything

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.790
 well

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:22.690
 the little nfs this year 4.4 billion reais with the comb is our new

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:28.750
 anti-fluorine program with four more 4 billion points that fail to spend

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:31.530
 with inss

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:42.100
 the defense in 2009 already paid 60 million reais only I think it is a big

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:46.750
 problem for sure people looking to get into the

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:52.149
 safe defense program that at the end of the line that puts special inwards is

00:10:52.149 --> 00:10:58.060
 are colony associations entities but now with this record that we

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:03.370
 we are finalizing the system even with a lot of anti-fraud system

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:08.020
 we really want to confirm the authenticity of whoever is taking it

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:13.180
 many people who have passed away are cpf are used in correctly so the

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:17.320
 system was delayed because we are doing the anti-fraud systems

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:22.209
 precisely to have respect for the citizen's money today, 3 billion people

00:11:22.209 --> 00:11:28.779
 the federal government spends on closed insurance, remembering that according to

00:11:28.779 --> 00:11:34.180
 cgil almost 70% are fraudulent there are people who are closed and a place that

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:38.920
 don't even have water to drink few people no no you know the state I wrote

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.970
 here you guayaquil who receives more insurance defensively to support

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:48.430
 all just coincidence brazil has 26 states plus df 27 units of the

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:53.320
 federation i lost the elections in the nine states of the

00:11:53.320 --> 00:12:04.720
 northeast in the 9 will then be under 27 federation units - 9 27 the version

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:17.860
 least 98 of the 18 states plus the df is so 18 and a massive campaign was carried out in

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:22.660
 stop saying that I was going to end the insurance closed to the maximum then the cause

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.060
 main reason for me to lose a single state, right?

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:30.399
 outside the northeast of pará in the case of closed insurance then the staff in addition to

00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:34.660
 defrauding a lot of people has fraud anywhere central already had in

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:39.490
 second and did you will do what you have and we want to fight it give this

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.579
 money someone works who pays the hard earned tax for this is to give to

00:12:42.579 --> 00:12:48.240
 who doesn't need it or who's giving it to fishermen in the desert close to zero on the side

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:55.000
 only from israel in time and culture 0 this is it

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.870
 is the cause of my defeat was exactly that of not being able to

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:03.220
 fighting with humble people is the vast majority need I defend no one will

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:07.180
 end it there but that part that I didn’t need I give power to

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:10.990
 cavaco silva campaign defended what we want is to strengthen the real

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:15.100
 fisherman who even visits us to the capital asking for a look has a lot of fraud

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:19.390
 make a record with fraud lipsticks because we can even captain

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:25.290
 just like it did with the family grant on the 13th we can expand it to others is

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:29.140
 modalities today that do not receive closed insurance but first there is how to do

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:34.540
 right, as in the case of captain fraud, we made a balance of

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.630
 2019 this magazine will be made available

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:42.820
 electronically with all actions, that is, a satisfaction for society

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:47.980
 that in 2019 the secretariat of aquaculture and fisheries did for Brazil delivered

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.660
 for brazil for brazilians so folks the magazine was super top

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:55.960
 we are not going to spend money on this one this is just a model you

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.870
 will be able to choose will have made available electronically gives a

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:07.570
 look revealed free of charge and the person wants to leave I don’t know just a tip of it

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:13.660
 appeared well most of the time we did everything we did for the benefit of

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:18.280
 Brazilian continuing here to greet the boy

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:22.930
 marcello antony do turismo and gilson machado do da embratur our friend o

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:27.280
 tourism debated everyone recognizing everyone is how is it there the beaches of santa

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.330
 catarina chumbada and it’s not just the holy house in brazil all the

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:36.970
 staff has informed us telling us please contact send video a lady or

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:41.170
 Miss you from Santa Catarina made a video talking here

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:47.230
 sell what offered that renting properties in the area with mourinho there is no other for

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:53.230
 she ran away name here okay so really now largely the

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:59.140
 marcelo do gilson's work was the invention of a reversal of the

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:04.060
 visa reciprocity that was the guy from australia united states japan

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.130
 I have a final trip of the month now to

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:11.500
 India I don’t know if there will be time yet maybe we didn’t demand it ourselves

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:16.090
 visa exclusivity for him is for him and India is the country that is

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:22.690
 growing a lot around 1 billion and 300 million inhabitants but that and has

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:26.350
 a very large mass that practices tourism around the world and Brazil is one of the

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:30.340
 countries that receive less tourism button we will continue to open this way

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:34.690
 as for china it is quite advanced this condition will not bill if not

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:38.650
 do a lot with tourism I think I'm average sure on the album

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:46.930
 the pib the world pib is for tourism is approximately 10% but it is well below

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:48.850
 I think that Brazil has to be above

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:54.250
 of the world average so tourism will continue to be a priority in our

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:58.180
 capital government including tourism in the northeast that staff were very

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:02.680
 concerned about the accident there with oil is tourism in the northeast was not

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:08.410
 impacted and almost complete reservations in the hotels the information of the hotels there

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:12.610
 we receive information from third parties suddenly jesus can confirm us more

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:16.930
 absolute success of tourism in our Brazilian Northeast also despite

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:21.070
 everything that happened look I took the little video here send

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:25.450
 for me but the simulator got away and I got in touch with the owner of one of the

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:30.820
 floating hotels that you have in the amazonas region is to contact the

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.310
 public sought out the owner of the enterprise

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:37.450
 I also spoke with the secretary who answered the phone and I did very well

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:43.300
 treated I was being 6 in salvador asked for authorization to disclose the

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:48.250
 I divulged it with live phone companies, so this Amazonian tourism from what I saw there

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.850
 of the image those river inlets form

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:58.540
 true alagoas there is the hotel set up there has all the possible comfort

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:04.300
 this strategy is around 20 minutes by speedboat from manaus and because I

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:09.130
 interested in spreading the culture of the amazon is welcome in addition to bringing resources to

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:14.410
 us and shows those who come from outside that the amazon didn’t catch fire or is not on fire

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:18.390
 fire is a big lie i wanted to know now it's on fire

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:21.990
 beach know I know it's a color said a sacred thing

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:26.520
 spoke and put in doubt the sovereignty in australia not that girl too

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:33.930
 in that little one she said something right at the time and in Brazil that doesn’t compare

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:40.170
 what happened that happens all over brazil which is a little bit cultural is hard to change

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:44.720
 people's heads the question of setting fire to the swidden

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:49.950
 it will hardly end with that but what's with the sum that happened

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:56.730
 in Brazil in the past, in addition to being below average in the last few years,

00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:00.330
 compare to what happened in australia i even called today by the minister

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:03.450
 fernando defense then i called minister ernesto

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:08.400
 we have little to offer australia but the ministry in these foreign affairs has already

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.940
 must have contacted the room or little we have to offer

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:16.410
 we are making available to fight the fire in ours that we have

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:22.700
 help our fire here in israel okay if i'm not mistaken here also from

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:29.280
 rushydro of argentina we have felt support is the cm know that by the size and

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.610
 by extension

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.280
 any help is not enough but it comforts us and is welcome so

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:43.470
 Brazil just did the same now via defense media and via my relations

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:47.880
 outdoors offered a helping hand to australia over there to fight the fire

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:54.270
 ok well but in the second class it's quick just know you only know who the sport is

00:18:54.270 --> 00:19:00.660
 most popular in Brazil you know I think it's possible is fishing

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:04.920
 piece fishing is more practiced more popular in brazil and for you to do the

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.580
 your cool fishing captain I want to know the following already have your fisherman's license

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:14.370
 biggest insurer aims here that the person looks up to the president here setting an example

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:19.560
 you have his amateur fishing license, you can fish both on beaches and in

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:24.000
 risk both shipped and unloaded it is necessary to make your wallet for you

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.100
 is in his activity with his amateur fishing is regular and within the law

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.920
 then he entered the ministry of agriculture in the

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:37.620
 the ministry makes its card whoever fishes on the continent pays 20 reais for

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:43.110
 year a very modest price and whoever goes with his boat and fishing is definitely

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:47.400
 amateur pay 60 reais a year captain already has the love card

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:51.480
 I also have my lack you also include yourself in this activity

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:55.710
 wonderful good to talk from the fundão to the last subject although you think that

00:19:55.710 --> 00:20:02.490
 veto or sanction founded in 2001 is sincerity the treasury used the scissors in

00:20:02.490 --> 00:20:06.480
 consequence was cut is often or sanctioning by inventing anything

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:10.350
 on the bench there is no equal to the judge said that the agent

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:17.040
 guarantee nobody spoke anything already guarantee congress approved 0 stayed a while in

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.690
 my table when I decided to call ready will appear the

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:26.910
 constitutionalists are those people who are not specialized in the subject to put

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:33.570
 fire and okay nobody said anything can criticize what will only be against the

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:38.780
 criticism that the first plan in the base back there to criticize who is who won

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:44.610
 I sanctioned it calmly of what I did without any problem remembered the abuse of

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:48.330
 authority all amend all everything that was asked for

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:54.270
 for me and my ministers by the wall by jorge by wagner and andré

00:20:54.270 --> 00:21:00.690
 I attended everyone to see you my congress brought down 80% some reaction from

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:05.430
 who is investing here 00 and 10 now the world that was my head of

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:12.660
 new about the guarantee judge to protect god and the sun

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:17.580
 I find it difficult to implement the guarantee, the problem is there with the

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.870
 judicial the legislative

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:28.429
 is and will be decided it will take years to decide this issue in years

00:21:28.429 --> 00:21:37.100
 now the guarantee judge in my analysis is not what the criticism puts

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:42.260
 out you have to put yourself in the situation of

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:45.500
 people who sometimes take into account there at the base, right

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:51.799
 in all professions we have our good and bad accesses and it falls into the hand of a mouse

00:21:51.799 --> 00:21:55.820
 it's complicated in something else practically exists in Brazil itself

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:58.580
 car wash was not only the Moorish sergeant who made only him

00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:04.580
 he was advised by some judges I didn't have it like that with others

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:09.610
 types of processes brazil also do alone and it is consensus of other people

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:14.990
 and there is a lot in many states that have a seat we want the guy to do the

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:20.000
 investigation there after the judge up front and in need of that action time

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:26.630
 experts don't have it right you dad and take care of people who spend the

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:30.919
 examining the order is only with examining the order has no power to end it in the

00:22:30.919 --> 00:22:34.100
 past eduardo cunha has enormous power failed to end the exam

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:38.900
 of the order the merit of not arguing I will present a project that I think

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:45.110
 that can pass in bed, it is useless to start playing a project in the

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:50.000
 camera that knows it will not be successful so I will talk continued

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.210
 talking to everybody, people even criticize that they don’t talk to

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:58.429
 the senate or institutions that I had until I’m talking patience

00:22:58.429 --> 00:23:02.059
 right is that they always told me in the past right

00:23:02.059 --> 00:23:06.080
 if in politics there are people you don't like when the president doesn't vote

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:11.440
 better 22 now we can't do something that

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:16.160
 as if I were the owner of the truth it has to be what I want what I tried

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.880
 watching me over there watching want us to do our part

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:25.130
 I’m confident that what I’m doing is in the best possible way

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:30.770
 going back to the fundão here the fundão was creating a law of 2017

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:34.780
 the achievement was not last year now that decided the issue of the minimum

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:39.710
 until then the criteria for defining the fund and what happens the budget is

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:43.880
 done all over the year for example next year's budget

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:49.070
 start drafting from now on to take shape and come back at the end of the year and

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:54.049
 what is sanctioned is parked and after it has been vetoed

00:23:54.049 --> 00:24:01.600
 if the veto is overturned, it will be valid b in 2007 the superior electoral court

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:08.690
 officiated to the Federal Revenue saying look at the time of making the budget

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:14.840
 I liked it I hope you have to allocate 2 billion reais 2 billion according to

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:23.770
 the 2017 law well what the recipe made the carioca

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:30.169
 this proposal the making of the budget during the discussion in parliament that

00:24:30.169 --> 00:24:37.309
 would put 3.8 billion is the number that I think for us is

00:24:37.309 --> 00:24:43.610
 exaggerated certainly not defending the 2 billion plus 3.8 is an exaggeration

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:49.100
 so I talked about the possibility of vetoing the agenda well that the parliament decided

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:58.730
 decided to accept the proposal of the tse that complied with the 2017 law and approved two

00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:05.320
 billions of reais now comes the folks will enjoy the event open to the open beta

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:10.970
 make it very clear I didn't use my campaign last year

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:18.410
 nor the fundão in a fund ró made a request for the internet yes of 14 million and a few

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:21.890
 years half of that the other half wanted to donate to the saint

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:25.580
 outside judge's house but the legislation did not allow so it was put

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:34.230
 the pl is there for the pss and then something else is right, the deputy in são paulo a

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:41.130
 woman came down the law and on the fundão here I have not decided yet I will not speak the

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:44.850
 what I should do I don't know yet is now deputy week used a million a year

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:50.490
 past that ffc special god of heaven background

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:54.360
 weird on the special campaign financing sheet so samuel

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:59.250
 moreira used a million last year and now made a little video to wear me out

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:02.760
 it's in fashion, right, it's my deputy theme in São Paulo

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:07.890
 also very cute deputy also cute is also criticizing me

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:14.550
 but she used this ffc in her campaign in the past 100 thousand reais

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:22.100
 criticizing people's morals and people's morals and just going to the website

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:27.840
 You can see that this cute congresswoman used that money 100 thousand we call a

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.300
 million reais i'm not here campaigning

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:35.270
 against it reestablishing the truth nothing more than a few days and that

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:41.100
 i want functional and if 2 bi because i will benefit that i am creating the

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:46.710
 party make it very clear you use it because i can and the alliance for brazil today

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:52.560
 I don't know how much I will be entitled to during the municipal elections in 2011

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:58.320
 while I will be entitled on the occasion of the 22 01 elections an hour in the

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:04.200
 internet he each do what he wants right guys talking about who uses the

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:08.010
 special fund will not vote for him so the people who are going to run for elections

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:11.940
 municipals know you are going to be patrolled why do you

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:17.040
 you are periodically obliged, you know, to give an account of what you received

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:22.440
 spent and when will you vote for the game in santa catarina joão candidate

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:29.850
 the guy goes to that installment is periodic accounts it was worth it for him got the x of

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:33.450
 deep in a battle stayed is always like that

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:37.590
 so look, people have to learn that things change

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:42.210
 nobody expected to arrive without a party fund and practically only with 8

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:46.480
 seconds the vision came and it was not a speech

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:51.520
 to deceive anyone because it’s difficult to deceive people out there

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:56.890
 and I even used the biblical passage of the game and 32 you will know the truth and the

00:27:56.890 --> 00:28:00.840
 truth will set you free, and so it was done in that campaign seeks

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:06.040
 do everything you promised in the campaign because it is possible to get there now not

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:12.910
 the laws do not depend only on me, it depends largely on the legislature

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:17.140
 Jorge that their last word even offering has the power to overturn the veto

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:22.380
 and sometimes even the overturn of the veto is settled in the tournament that I’m always

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:29.440
 right so democracy so i will position myself as president of

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:34.420
 republic now the detail of the fund has a

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:40.360
 functional device I made one with 1 post now and what happens right I

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:43.750
 take into account that I think you read a text of about here size

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:48.310
 here and interpret if it's very good a minute is

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:52.690
 awesome what happens i went back the text not a minute is over 100

00:28:52.690 --> 00:28:58.750
 comments of what she didn’t read didn’t read if implement go there to veto veto affects

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:04.260
 the sale well in the profile of people also to take a look that what attended

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:11.050
 because it is a subject that requires a certain knowledge what I put it that says

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:16.750
 article 85 of the constitution speaks of crimes of responsibility

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:21.970
 ok and there it is judged then they are a crime of

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:26.110
 responsibility for the acts of the public authorities is mine to undermine the

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:31.900
 federal concession especially against i will put that only three in gray that

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:37.840
 there are seven incisive three here so pay attention to the exercise of rights

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.990
 I can answer for the crime of

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:43.780
 impeachment responsibility impeachment process

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:52.570
 if I for example violate the budgetary law being a canvas is also

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:55.300
 liability crime which is more serious

00:29:55.300 --> 00:30:00.540
 item 7 compliance with the laws I have to comply with the law my god in heaven

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:05.560
 you have a law voted on even if you vetoed it after it was stolen it's easy

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:09.880
 accelerated with the president in enforcing the law yourself you also have to

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:15.940
 comply with this there is a 2007 law that says that you have to have a fund of 2 billion

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:21.820
 according to the tse according to the Federal Revenue I will veto

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:26.710
 this is for sure someone will file a request for gay impeachment from the

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:32.260
 parliament you of the people and will speak to the table rodrigo maia ismai can speak look

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:38.980
 I will not go ahead with the process it can is a displacement of it will be saved

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:43.120
 in a little while 115 thousand any complaint against me is like

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:47.230
 happened already answers for rafinha of the past and until the husband answers for

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:49.600
 environmental crime in the past until it was filed

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:54.300
 I am now responding for an apology to the rape.

00:30:54.300 --> 00:31:00.490
 justice teacher tried to help a relative already knows what I'm talking about right

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:06.010
 I don’t get involved in these issues here in court decisions or anything else

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:11.380
 report any ready ok there i don't even know what natura is

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:17.170
 a new representation taking into account article 85 of the fund is pressure is the

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:21.160
 plenary and then folks you want me to keep the flank open

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:25.390
 rodrigo maia spoke will fulfill the word of god and that's what tocantins is all about but

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:31.990
 up there he can put pressure on me and I have my job done

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:39.910
 so if someone sees you an argument that can counter Article 85

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:45.910
 of the song alright otherwise i ask please as it reads hit my

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:50.530
 facebook keeping social networks don't have everything there that should happen with the

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:55.350
 fundão then some say ah you said that the

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:59.740
 soldier who goes to war and is afraid to fight a coward but this fight that I

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:07.840
 I'm playing with open chest on the battlefield or return has already been voted for

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:14.820
 scene even if the tse is 2007 law the law says it has to be a special fund

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:20.559
 special highlights sergio and the values ​​that the tse sets does not take into account the value

00:32:20.559 --> 00:32:27.970
 two years ago he did it at the conventions right there and he presents the budget and so much that

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:34.000
 at least 2 billion reais that was not 32.8 almost doubling 90% more

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:41.320
 and congratulations to the parliament and that decided not to leave 3.8 I could veto

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:47.050
 I think that from there, in view of the excess, I could veto the excess, but the

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:51.179
 parliament could overturn the veto could and the expense they want to see from

00:32:51.179 --> 00:32:55.990
 23.8 billion more bear the merit in mexico so we have conditional

00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:58.000
 because it would be contrary to the condition itself

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.860
 so if someone has a different argument we change the positioning

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:07.600
 of dilma at the moment the position the young man is to follow the law and I have to give

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:12.040
 example tocantins even when you know that the law does not please us

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:17.350
 you can see i would like the model to have a 16 year old background but have to

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:20.590
 following the convention some speak also wish i had

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:26.530
 life imprisonment in brazil but it is there in article 5 of the constitution i am mistaken

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:34.260
 item that speaks in brazil there will be no death penalty perpetual character

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:43.190
 what else comes perpetual banishing and cruel character death and there's one more there

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:48.179
 so you have to respect it is our law and the device is the song that

00:33:48.179 --> 00:33:51.809
 i'm upset with him but have to respect for 100 for example if a

00:33:51.809 --> 00:33:57.869
 citizen could be able to live in harmony in society a lot is changing predicts

00:33:57.869 --> 00:34:01.080
 the Christmas pardon grant ours had some say that I’m not seeing

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.570
 my word the two-part pardon the first

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:08.849
 part of it is for those who are elderly, qatar crawling in jail and has a disease

00:34:08.849 --> 00:34:13.710
 terminal is an expense is a name for us all if the

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:17.609
 family wants to take home as they sit on the sheet - pedro for us and not

00:34:17.609 --> 00:34:22.829
 will commit morning the weather is in a terminal phase is very old will stay

00:34:22.829 --> 00:34:26.220
 almost the layer something a problem building by people and

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:31.139
 yet that person cannot have committed any honor crime for

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:38.279
 torture among others and another part is for the police the other military and

00:34:38.279 --> 00:34:45.599
 civilian gf civilian firefighter who committed non-willful crimes was not with intent

00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:50.789
 of non-willful killing in fulfillment of the duty that happens more than the police

00:34:50.789 --> 00:34:55.919
 there he is in an operation and suddenly someone goes to the police station to talk look

00:34:55.919 --> 00:35:00.329
 that this that that policeman there who was playing the game in his chest just lacked

00:35:00.329 --> 00:35:06.000
 he coils himself often he is condemned touching something weird there

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.940
 take the cops out on the street just to see how it looks in your life we ​​already had in

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:13.200
 past experience in some states where police officers went on strike

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:20.819
 saints only bahia also in pernambuco was a disgrace is a disgrace

00:35:20.819 --> 00:35:26.099
 police officers in general perform a phenomenal job

00:35:26.099 --> 00:35:32.279
 taking into account their private life, the state provides for them and

00:35:32.279 --> 00:35:36.299
 it’s hard to think about legislation so I came up with a bill

00:35:36.299 --> 00:35:40.099
 that in giló there is valid for everybody in general

00:35:40.099 --> 00:35:45.930
 emgerpi the military responds but has no punishment flame hides and lawfulness

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:48.539
 some say I'm giving it right they give it

00:35:48.539 --> 00:35:52.049
 police right to kill don't want police money not to die and if

00:35:52.049 --> 00:35:54.930
 defend I think a son your brother has a

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:59.990
 relative of a friend that the policeman he will be going up the hill many times

00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:05.789
 doing a search and seizure somewhere do a repossession and

00:36:05.789 --> 00:36:11.069
 him and is surprised by an armed element and will act do as expected

00:36:11.069 --> 00:36:16.799
 he took a shot to answer more went up in entering node by agent that was it

00:36:16.799 --> 00:36:20.940
 that the correction of the second Brazil is a very sensitive issue decreased by 22%

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:24.930
 before the second measure was taken by the governor acknowledge by the government

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:28.859
 federal government recognizes this anti-crime process in the world that he told me that

00:36:28.859 --> 00:36:31.740
 I didn't want to care to see that it came out more

00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:36.270
 there has been progress and it cannot be a long time for you there is no way to solve it for a year

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:40.020
 for another to serve the population from one minute to the next come on let's go

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:45.390
 solve the same issue of getting this new law now I already wanted me to

00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:51.480
 now a lot of things would come back right after the sanction of the law is that you have as

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:54.869
 take action says the technician from Aveiro I cannot break the law

00:36:54.869 --> 00:36:57.260
 is underway in a crime of liability

00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:03.779
 many things I sanction the wind right there the pain in the heart but obliged to do

00:37:03.779 --> 00:37:06.750
 this i'm not doing the thing well done

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:13.380
 I'm sorry no one is going to be eternal policy hit and wait for if it's been chosen

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:16.890
 someone different our choice much better than us who has a lot of people who

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:24.450
 can't take any more mistakes guys let's eat more fish and a shirt like more

00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:31.710
 fish 2020 and know that you are my super smart fish my light fish how

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:41.910

 with him here okay he understood still look at my son there look at the old man

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:57.360
 here he said i am thank you very much for

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:01.350
 opportunity is a considerable part of the comments

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:05.340
 volleyball and other advice go there and get the most important thing for us to see the

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:08.370
 that went wrong is what can improve for the next live

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:13.530
 and the intention of this ilk to show you what happens in Brazil

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:18.780
 if you really know what a government is inside and out

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:24.690
 you can choose someone better in politics for me the cd and cd deputy

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:29.490
 senator because all of us here have an expiration date, you know, choose people

00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:33.030
 better to be able to have a smaller dimension brazil i include myself these people that you

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:36.720
 can change in the future to choose the best people

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:41.790
 ok now i think the numbers just showing ok we are in

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:45.930
 right way is a team of law ministers who think can't forget those

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:49.800
 boys from previous governments make the comparison can only be criticizing

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:55.440
 equal comparison or education mission have problems have but housed it proves

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:59.820
 is doing an exceptional job there is the ministry that can even a short time

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:04.950
 you look at textbooks some books even decided that we don't like it and

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:12.240
 distributing food because books that are going to be part of the three-year plan

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:18.810
 meet the interest of the parents of the family you put in school from 2021

00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:25.260
 and jorge had a lot of books that arrived at the library what people from the past

00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:32.030
 do in buying 200 million l to distribute to the school talk about the program

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:41.240
 since asked for one on the outside is asking there by way of the blind books others

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:46.770
 knew barbarity there he will send to school did not have the stamp all

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:50.070
 well she will arrive at the school hence the kids library

00:39:50.070 --> 00:39:55.200
 for the love of god every barbarity this this will no longer happen

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:58.440
 the current year even though I am obliged to make books is

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:04.410
 which, in my opinion, doesn’t suit the interests of Dad and Mom’s parents

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:10.770
 from a big teacher to more teachers, we can't change that.

00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:15.840
 so god willing from sunday 21 look at the enemy's proof something

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:22.830
 weird the specific language the group exists so each one 100 belongs to the

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:30.540
 ab abc xyz group wonder now you at school learning and going out so that

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:36.210
 two Portuguese biology mathematics who learned the profession of graves and

00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:40.770
 culture fishing engineering theory is Brazil I confess to you here if I

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:48.240
 knew the potential of the knee I would not have ended the ministry of

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:53.450
 fishing had started to only start with having more and more means of better working

00:40:53.450 --> 00:41:00.630
 this question of fishing in Brazil is to hear you could study a little bit here

00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:04.980
 in Brazil where I said that one passes out this difficulty how much he will pay

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:10.710
 even in what lehmann but a hectare more or less a football field of water

00:41:10.710 --> 00:41:16.830
 you can create according to embrapa from 10 to 15 tons of tilapia per year you receive

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:22.770
 the difficulty of making time on your property huge environmental license

00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:28.980
 we improved a lot but it’s not just putting people there who want the progress of the

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:33.650
 Brazil has to comply with the law and have certain

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:40.079
 environmental has to be a law does not exist anywhere in the world and only here in

00:41:40.079 --> 00:41:44.250
 Brazil is called the rigging of legislation

00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:49.859
 to favor cheetah forms if dealing with the environmental issue Brazil is the country

00:41:49.859 --> 00:41:54.480
 that takes care of the environment the most, nobody has such a large percentage

00:41:54.480 --> 00:42:00.559
 like ours for 60% environmental preservation is our time

00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:06.570
 I think that Europe doesn’t have a riparian forest pole here

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:10.980
 are tens of meters according to a local region of brazil and the staff is the

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:14.490

 avant-garde chat people now look for the day as the countryside rebels and

00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:38.090

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:46.840
