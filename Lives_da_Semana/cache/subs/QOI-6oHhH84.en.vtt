 special surgical tools in the fight against corruption

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.899

 had a vacancy was approved and he stayed there on the transport committee and

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.640
 then he was appointed to be minister of culture doing a great job

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.850
 and today he is participating in the auction of the north-south railroad that connects and there he is

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.560
 the big west city of são paulo to porto nacional tocantins is worth it

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.250
 remember that this railway was being built 30 years ago and now with this

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.360
 better we think that for two years

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.000
 there it is is completed

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.619
 also remembering that the last railroad auction in Brazil was ten years ago

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.470
 resumption of rail transport in brazil

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:17.750
 let's now go to the truckers question before saying the following the

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.140
 pre-candidate in some typical moments of Brazil I had on the lawn in rio grande

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.110
 from the south I was also in rio de janeiro and here

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.600
 at that time the cohesion of the axis was raised in the q not that they charged

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.180
 toll in the previous government this matter was also resolved a complaint in the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.019
 electronic assembly that for sure the minister sisu

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:50.480
 we don’t want any more new sparrows in Brazil

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.709
 electronic billing is not electronic assembly

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.200
 I don’t want it on his desk in a few weeks, don’t ask for eight

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.480
 thousand new sparrows cancel this story is over this joke what

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.190
 it happens look I already died a previous boo it is worth talking again here

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.130
 because our concern is to end the use that the fine industry has to use

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.269
 your hand in your pocket nothing more than that we will not find that half a dozen

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.170
 people brazil is worried about you but suffered an accident on the road there

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.970
 concern and even a hand in your pocket and look only at toll roads which

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:36.739
 what happened is is that companies a percentage of what they collected from the toll had

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:44.470
 which of course is to make works performed is the painting collection

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:56.180
 plug-hole own then what happened

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.390
 these people what could discount these

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.269
 works the applied in monitoring and how love budget is still done via fine

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.409
 the directory so you act sometimes they hurt the day I wasn’t going to keep

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:15.480
 this road to the right painting budget was going to pay companies to charge

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.910
 fine from you and beyond what is settled change if you withdraw the contracts

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.550
 perhaps expired they will not be renewed look what is the

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.500
 rio-santos highway i know very well it has a 40 new electronic source of 40

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.539
 for now it is appropriate to accept resolved regarding this

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.590
 interests not only hair as well as all those who drive in the car

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.050
 brazil truckers right the novelty until

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:52.830
 reported that the readjustment of the price of diesel oil will be carried out or

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.410
 periods of not less than 15 days or if today, for example, had an adjustment

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:04.860
 tchizo price review the next review in 15 days or more and more

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.940
 we still had the procaminhoneiro program complained that he

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:16.139
 the freight port porto alegre was playing a role and we between round trip 12

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.750
 days he complained that a lot of people get the

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.180
 freight and the return involving the recovery of the loss

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.039
 departed almost all of his freight is swallowed by the new black nudist

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.840
 what the federal government through the boy within the mines and energies

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:41.160
 also agreed with petrobrás that we will have it there for a maximum of 90 days

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:47.240
 trucker card what is that the trucker passes fuel and

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.560
 filled the card over there, you know, with diesel oil, who's going to pay the

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.580
 price to the deviation of the day and it was proven that physiologism

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.960
 done right at 500 liters the shot doesn’t matter if the price of oil went up

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:08.400
 or not and so this is an advantage guarantees him that his freight will not be

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.330
 consuming the possible readjustment in the price of gift gold

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.710
 once again congratulations to our instrument boy admiral members for

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.990
 israel tarciso captain tarcísio is not even so good that he says here is also the

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:30.069
 o our us that matters far from my side here so beauty congratulations to you

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:34.930
 are doing everything possible with all certainty new measures will be adopted in the

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.460
 next week changing the subject here airfare

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.930
 you may think that it really is not when it comes to 85 million reais

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.460
 in the budget is little but with the version taken by the federal government

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:55.479
 here is the the ministries is to buy the past is and the albums that agencies

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:59.560
 so now the tickets will no longer be purchased and we, the ministry itself

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.180
 buys savings of R $ 35 million from the government

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.090
 I think a lot of people will not like it yet, for sure, the staff

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.960
 of the agency but I'm sorry but I think people will like it more than

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.219
 you made 35 million the union spending network

00:07:15.219 --> 00:07:21.969
 I will come back here to propose this one that the ead had a month but before they had signed

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:27.490
 a decree our visit the decree exempting the

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.419
 reciprocity between the visa issue the following countries united states japan

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:34.139
 canada australia

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.919
 this visa exemption for the careers campaigns that sends bikers from the

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:47.070
 Brazil is going to be a big gain in Brazil that has already delivered a sector that a lot of people

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:53.130
 and Brazil was depriving itself of these tourists by requiring visas is with this

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:57.450
 country that has tourism will be much more now with greater ease of

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:03.480
 arriving in Brazil that the visa is no longer needed for us is there is

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.710
 this should generate at least 1 billion dollars a year

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:11.550
 additional income in terms of Brazilians

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:15.900
 we estimate that it is usually more than that only on the first day after leaving

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:22.680
 news on a travel website has already registered 31% more interest in traveling

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:27.030
 to australian americans to brazil also that only that already

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:35.430
 will generate a name is the moment of tourism in brazil for sure for example the rate of

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:39.000
 hotel occupation regret more advantage job

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.450
 some in the field had to have reciprocity

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:47.190
 I think that at first we did the right thing

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:53.580
 in a second moment, who knows, we will be able to achieve the future, right in the

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:58.950
 moment it is very welcome there resources from abroad by means of tourists but it is still worth

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:03.420
 for those who do a business in brazil it will also welcome, said an agency of the agency

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:08.820
 kayaking at the time on the way is the moment of madness, right in Australia

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.810
 of this order australia united states canada and japan

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:19.500
 on average 30% more walkway structure for our brazil said by

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.350
 that the old man here but I have participation leads to speak here to

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:29.450
 move ahead when battisti was found in brazil where i went against

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:36.410
 the asylum for the middle here in the deputy side candid chamber

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:42.100
 the divine struggle much of life xavier was careful but he was

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.360
 I extradited him before assuming the presidency I did not leave Brazil I know why

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:55.060
 that the hit is and was caught in bolivia and the government claims morales has decided to send

00:09:55.060 --> 00:10:00.160
 you back to bahia the next day and regret now that it happened I want to

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:08.970
 say he confessed the four murders the four executions of humble people

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.880
 teacher and now I want to see the face of the left of Brazil that I defended as

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:19.000

 its actions to 90 terrorists in the world

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:41.079
 the father was from Bolivia they spoke about Brazil and is entitled to 30 years would have

00:10:41.079 --> 00:10:44.529
 right to 30 years you spend here in Brazil when you spent

00:10:44.529 --> 00:10:48.310
 we talked to the Italian government at the time he did the same thing

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:52.120
 possible comment so decided instead of going through the club it goes on in brazil

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:59.529
 30 years old as he was 64 unit would leave with 94 at most 1 hour and now sorry

00:10:59.529 --> 00:11:04.779
 life became complicated because his life Brazil is no longer paradise and

00:11:04.779 --> 00:11:13.180
 terrorists wearing the cloak of political prisoner or refugee to battisti be

00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:16.060

 the symbology stop president of the federal supreme court

00:11:47.729 --> 00:11:52.829
 Brazil is above us so we don’t have to discuss these minor problems

00:11:52.829 --> 00:11:57.119

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:13.470
 there is a lot of news for us here in Brazil is ending

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:24.140
 the idea is the only one apart from social security is the president of

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:29.780
 commission with that justice appointed on this date deputy marcelo freitas is

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:36.500
 delegate of the federal police of minas gerais of psl for his report then if

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:40.010
 plays with that pending on the justice constitution committee he will give you the

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:46.430
 its opinion as to the admissibility or not of this proposal to reform the

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:50.320
 who is against still on Thursday against pt pc do bep sol

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:54.530
 appears these people have no commitment to the future of Brazil

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:58.910
 I really like you to retire if the man with 25 years old woman in the green would be

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:05.090
 ideal but as the presence is at the moment it sunday 22 or even earlier until

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:08.480
 the break is so that Brazil does not break the

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:16.880
 our annual deficit in the tens of billions of reais and is

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.430
 unsustainable payment of the first stage

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:24.740
 if the pension reform was approved, the senate would be right

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:29.120
 we will make your possible corrections we are not perfect

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:36.530
 we count again with 513 deputies and 81 senators to improve the

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:41.150

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:45.260
 regarding the economy and jobs here bringing this month

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:52.280

00:18:52.280 --> 00:19:02.870
 retirement that will receive her our already 64 years old street will also

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:08.740
 receiving retirement this is essential and necessary and we

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:12.700
 expects her to be approved the best you try and approved by the

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:18.190
 the senate is one thing to do nothing but our enthusiasm this next

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:22.360
 president is going to think it's going to be building a new relationship that I

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:27.010
