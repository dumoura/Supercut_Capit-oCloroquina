 for Augusto Nunes Zé Maria and use avoid commenting on something to do

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.690
 question and André obviously that our

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:42.720
 Minister lazy and few are missing I think the extension of sick pay or

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.070
 by the end of the year it's solved, but at heart it was created to be paid

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:52.860
 in three times of 6 years it falls when ours by decree by bank plus two and so

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:59.970
 you economy would be Brazilian economy, right, it's like, it's another contribution, he

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.050
 for you, here are the savings, if I am a big presence and the measure

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:09.020
 need to pay right with all the leaders no one at that time pro

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:14.490
 Rodrigo Maia called to see the people also from the Cerrado bed was like a

 agreement we set the value 300reais he ordering a Provisional Measure to

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:24.479
 the congress you are not mistaken or you provisional measure the remedy he is a

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:32.490
 start right video without problem some I think we can send people who lost

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:39.100
 job I went we have can go after I already said

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:43.900
 the last two problems ahead of me there is gender and unemployment that me

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:49.750
 to treat with the same responsibility and at the same time many people thought that

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:56.890
 love and the positive of staying at home close the world Down happened with a lot of lost

00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:03.670
 their job the informal ones are so were the first hard hit and we are

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:10.150

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:16.150
 the cream portion of an emergency aid 65 million people were

 and then with interest and I wanted it to be all percent

00:08:38.579 --> 00:08:42.390
 nobody was ever happening in Brazil was marked with a pen

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:51.149
 complement with responsibility and each point presented in the Partnership that and

00:08:51.149 --> 00:08:57.360
 pre 60 70 million interest that you pay per year for has a fat still of

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.040
 approximately 140 million I together keep falling

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:11.449
 and it's silly I can't do that I don't interfere it logically ours a

00:09:11.449 --> 00:09:15.589
 people will fight for what he is happy there I hope man next time

00:09:15.589 --> 00:09:19.670

00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:32.329
 hence the free small Small Business is also possible special heck that

00:09:32.329 --> 00:09:39.290
 to avoid dismissal for pains one stop paying for the trip could see the

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:43.009
 reduction of wages at work in the federal government that pay November and

00:09:43.009 --> 00:09:48.769
 slip also has to have a point that I don't know the finger we roll debts

00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:57.170
 status We also think of the loss of states that the ICMS forecast also of

00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:01.020
 municipalities present a loss of ISS that together do not

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:09.860
 the coach today I by the Supreme Court then our father's

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:17.150

 once using in return around here could be cured why that only has

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:59.060
 that tar linking this happiness is then what happens there I a campaign

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:06.800
 some hands intent on tracking the team to the pellucid forehead you have

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:11.330
 things here i am not a doctor so what i did i like to chase after

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:15.380
 things so much puts Fidel here warns the North American that he started to study

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:21.470
 As we can call, we have to talk at the ready station there is a

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:26.550
 possibility hi how are you

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:33.570
 is too much presidency stomping the biggest a possibility we know we hadn't

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:43.459
 scientific proof but that in a way the calf Qual a Previdência the averages and

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:49.940
 so i started talking about it here and i start treatment new example

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:56.490

00:11:56.490 --> 00:12:01.560
 was just and I always said that it is active the losses checks at home for

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:06.839
 boring the curve don't want to see that you won't get the goal was that you

00:12:06.839 --> 00:12:15.120
 get it later along Detran hit spread the milk that's it and with and

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:21.120
 with respirators do you remember Prime Minister us who became the

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:26.529
 Globo's marketer is fixing up I haven't checked yet

00:12:26.529 --> 00:12:32.220
 it is because angry what the marketer says to tell you stay at home

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:38.259
 when you are missing there you go capital So that they would be troubled to be intubated

00:12:38.259 --> 00:12:42.999
 Vacuum cleaner president So let's buy the respirator quickly paying the bill 30

00:12:42.999 --> 00:12:50.559
 even buy 200 thousand, you didn't know what's going on there, he doesn't see you

00:12:50.559 --> 00:12:56.670
 leg that is making changes silver guys put unfortunate President because

00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:06.180
 stolen the health of the people and the Education of the People should be expelled from life you then

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:11.199
 unfortunately we have had cases that the federal police have verified that

00:13:11.199 --> 00:13:16.720
 represent the logical acquisitions have to have responsibility everyone has

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:24.660
 within it for DP the defense within the process now there is evidence of

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:29.930
 public authorities the crisis where people and thousands of

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:36.620
 people can die are dying and you make it an opportunity to

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:43.240
 make dirty money and we can't have more in Brazil so

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.830
 the Federal Police has Total Independence it works together with the

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:54.370
 Prosecutors, these operations are authorized by the judiciary, many of the

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:59.890
 times by the Superior Court of Justice according to the level of authority that is

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:05.320
 involved and what we can say for our society for our people is the

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:11.920
 following President we have no commitment we have no commitment to

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:18.430
 them and corruption based on the three determinations of the Lord and

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:26.080
 our commitments to the people also the federal police will not agree with

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:31.510
 misconduct so if you want to do the wrong thing

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:37.630
 and on our part the Federal Police will be attentive will act and in the most

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:44.200
 quick and logical series doing it with all responsibility André combats the

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.490
 Corruption Ah ok, I won't go into detail here

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:55.079
 Everyone knows how We choose 23 months now it helps to

00:14:55.079 --> 00:15:00.709
 avoiding the condition of President the best way to fight corruption is to prevent

00:15:00.709 --> 00:15:06.140
 and how do I prevent doing principles of good governance

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:12.630
 and how good public governance in the world is done by choosing people for

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:22.520
 merit for the ability to life in a hurry with commitment to the people with

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:29.960
 ability to respond to criticisms to correct errors and to act in a

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:37.980
 honest proof and this plan say what you want we are a year and eight

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:43.820
 months of government we don't have a step of systemic corruption within the government

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:50.280
 President Jair Bolsonaro's government has been an example of combating corruption at

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:56.400
 federal police acted like we never have since we took on President we have

00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:02.550
 active Federal victim We have seen a Federal Highway Police active

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:08.870

 here was the focus of corruption and completely changed look at the ports of

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:41.570
 When Brazil put the distance it was a party fight today Tarciso set up a

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:46.460
 secretariat within the ministry to prevent corruption has to delegate

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:57.260
 some that I thought were lifeless and Too Late in government when there were people

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.590
 here there was no commitment there you didn't even care today he was even in the military

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:07.730

 and what will be accommodated Okay it will mess with the port if it were the general if

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:46.710
 it could be it could even work but the most appropriate is humiliating is seeing

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:52.159
 right in the colleague it's working there is no political sponsorship

00:20:52.159 --> 00:20:57.659

 have to change your cell phone is the director is this PG is everyone is

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:40.930
 we imploded in this exchange everyone who just knows it has been another take 3

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:46.060
 kilos did not say something curiosity machine to complete that it will

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:50.470
 give vaccine here quick game saw the staff is demanding right presence part

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:54.880
 of the company is not part of the Pingo Doce operation so much that the Zé Maria lunch says

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:59.080
 what you have left you always had an exempt position regarding this and objective

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:06.340
 also have no alternative take this And you where you can die I only have

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:11.200
 that type of medicine, right? that possibility takes it, it needs a

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:15.850
 scientific background forgot that TV has a newspaper of Death all and 86 of

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:20.370
 night right newspaper of Death TV that mouth there now

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:27.600
 I’m in the legal process, your answer is that TV you seek to remove then

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:33.570
 here demanding scientific proof of antenna education there at the foot didn’t want

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:39.330
 but nowadays many people support that the vaccine is even applied

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:43.800
 with this Dilma in the law is not written before the law that exists is in effect

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:50.220
 okay the law says that teams can be adopted they may not be saying that

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:57.000
 populated this is the taking such a such a measure But come on and now Manda

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.549
 there was only one project coming from the bed I vetoed a part of that project there

00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:15.159
 I used to talk there about the measures you can use.

00:23:15.159 --> 00:23:20.440
 license price so let's talk about what measures medicines produced

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:28.690
 there the United States Japan and the European Union and China So what do you get in the project

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:34.299
 approved what to get here had a maximum of 72 hours here

00:23:34.299 --> 00:23:40.059
 released I went in life because I had some in life talk to me saw

00:23:40.059 --> 00:23:45.249
 she's operating at the bar again at Intermédica, right, it's at Anvisa to see her see

00:23:45.249 --> 00:23:50.139
 here some talk to me i talked and then and then she causes them again on

00:23:50.139 --> 00:23:56.519
 ready look to make a party enter there And then how does it get there

00:23:56.519 --> 00:24:02.909
 I couldn’t take the country test you guys in 72 hours will deliberate that I see it’s

00:24:02.909 --> 00:24:08.669
 that progress has a moment nowadays it has to welcome to distribute and

00:24:08.669 --> 00:24:16.169
 order to pick up in 72 hours I will not go down there that we have here

00:24:16.169 --> 00:24:20.789
 despite being produced in those countries of the block of countries right United States Japan

00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:25.919
 and European Union and China emphasis we have to ask certain questions you know

00:24:25.919 --> 00:24:30.029
 questioning after all right but we cannot be responsible for a vaccine

00:24:30.029 --> 00:24:34.409
 here there is no scientific proof right There is conformation in your relatives

00:24:34.409 --> 00:24:39.419
 of these of these in this one and of the countries but I don’t have here in Brazil

00:24:39.419 --> 00:24:43.889
 that to see deep down they are responsible go to put into the body of a

00:24:43.889 --> 00:24:47.339
 the vaccine because when I said, right, no one can force anyone to take the vaccine

00:24:47.339 --> 00:24:51.980
 vaccine the role no one can force him in the afternoon

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:55.590
 so yeah but the project this was taken down the

00:24:55.590 --> 00:25:01.830
 I also veto yes 72 hours I did I have not released deliberate is I think

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:06.630

 video there having sun that weighs the 29 bad words I had a reserved session

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:10.179
 I didn't use it here to stay free so fast I didn't say anything

00:27:10.179 --> 00:27:14.770
 people arresting running in the sand in a bikini the undergrowth there and other

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:19.360
 women learning here in the city on the cake and I didn’t say anything and the

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:22.690
 Supreme itself a decision that recently had nothing to do with a pandemic

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:29.140
 speaking of the conditions for you to use Gemma it was almost impossible to use and

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:33.980
 the policeman here maybe not Gilmar if someone who's sorry for

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:39.490
 him one thing but I had no people is a teenager swimming who was arrested

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:45.799
 ladies in a square alone thrown on the floor for and handcuffed there really was the

00:27:45.799 --> 00:27:52.970
 abuses and we have to know how to identify and differentiate the good

00:27:52.970 --> 00:28:00.799
 citizen the Crepe Band and yes we have to have the Rigor of the law the good citizen But we have

00:28:00.799 --> 00:28:06.139
 that preventing educating and guiding has something to do I am not the owner of

00:28:06.139 --> 00:28:11.000
 truth I don't even want to see what goes through me for my cart is ideal O

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.090
 parliament has an obligation and responsibility to perfect projects

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:21.559
 better now we have an interference in my understand center interference

00:28:21.559 --> 00:28:25.320
 judiciary or quite strong is from this collection

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:30.519
 and why and I was elected to do certain things

00:28:30.519 --> 00:28:33.549
 that I lose you wrap me up only the Supreme is now analyzing an action

00:28:33.549 --> 00:28:38.649
 a political party on the 200 notes already by the constitution that

00:28:38.649 --> 00:28:43.870

 Central and now I can say it’s not for I couldn’t, because the wheel does the

00:28:57.250 --> 00:29:02.649

 underwear wash people she who puts down penalty she makes money that on paper day

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:12.130

 router stays here it keeps talking about the time there so we have a new standard

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:24.700
 for the application of fixed radars that really will not have radar

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:30.850
 tree now wanted to end you happened that is you have justice see

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:37.750

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:42.910
 Tarciso he has already raised with geographic coordinates I did better

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:50.020
 acquaintances you will make the air that if we publish it’s left of the geography of

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:56.440
 all to give their place where they will keep out of that relationship if it is

00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:01.450
 television is wrong we are going to take a family State Highway then I can't

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:05.389
 nothing is planned, maybe it has already happened The Senate voted

00:34:05.389 --> 00:34:12.589
 the project moves the national traffic cosmo the Initial proposal my era

00:34:12.589 --> 00:34:19.159
 so that the driver's license appears for ten years then 65dw in bed

00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:24.829
 of a stir remains ten years but until 50 years of the nobody can accuse

00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:30.049
 that would be in question because she 65 already have 66 times does not give André here

00:34:30.049 --> 00:34:39.470

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:19.880
 future another if you ended up with an obligation was that thief simulators

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:27.130
