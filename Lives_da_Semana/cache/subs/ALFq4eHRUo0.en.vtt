 I have been accompanying your work for a long time to the exceptional person in the struggle

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:48.170
 family members of the genius behind the school

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.379
 congratulations congratulations and thank you very much for what you have done in the past and in

 present by the family crying the language of pounds right here the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.880
 method to die in that final also in low sea oil audi you deflect

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:25.830
 of them the smart goal the fish cells photo past and the use of it

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.150
 an oil slick in the sea some imagine trip would be killing fish

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:40.229
 for 24 hours a day this is not true some die works especially the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:48.780
 who live more on the surface the dolphin has to breathe happen they are fishing

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.350
 when the ox cannot be suspicious and do not look for a few hours in the capital if the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.040
 fish has sixth sense if it has crystal ball extinct to the fate of smell

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.030
 ascertained or intelligent the deal is as follows it deviates from

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:13.800
 spot ok and that even has theses is in the knot which is the american department

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.930
 11 years old registered but in a relaxed way we talk to the people

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.790
 sir always speaks to prove a relaxed and irreverent way the staff

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.830
 caught my foot but I can't face it, the wave so I'm surfing it

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.220
 gaining over a thousand followers has a lot of people supporting our

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.960
 work and the important thing is that fishing and aquaculture is in the mouth of the people today with

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.570
 intelligence or not the fish runs away from the spot that catch everything that is different

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.120
 I've practiced a lot at home, the husband, the even actor went to the special stab and

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.070
 today you see that you are different then it said that you run away you the shark in the next

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.180
 the rest of you run away you are natural but even

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.000
 now just want to criticize goal patience wants you to do what the staff

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:11.610
 there is to have a quick pass here to show that the government is going right

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.239
 thank god doing very well recovering the confidence of the whole world

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:23.390
 have money from abroad arriving in Brazil a lot of people here are recovering jobs

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:31.140
 it was all 700 thousand in ten months to almost 90 thousand per month on average taking out the

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.940
 jobs from brazil and still caught in brazil down there smashing economic

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.030
 and morally and ethically size and the penna slowly

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.380
 thank you very much to those in trusting us and taking advantage of that since the week

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.220
 I don’t know that I wouldn’t sign the São Paulo sheet any more

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.489
 the contract expires at the end of December as of next year no longer has eight

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.390
 São Paulo, the presence and vote announced today will also no longer have the

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.920
 capital letter magazine the contract signed last year for

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.690
 who subscribes to a magazine in this one only has lies, it is manifest that nilza a certain

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.380
 intelligence there is often outright lies is a magazine that

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.870
 unfortunately it is useless and she felt left dizzy so

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.650
 the government is not interested in this economic measure, also counting the floors is not

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.049
 chasing the sheet I didn't even notice the capital letter found the news clip

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.490
 unnecessary let's save money to

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:33.030
 contribute to have the motion this month now of October the lowest inflation referring to

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.160
 this October since 98 so that situation is really going to a

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:45.390
 level below that of the target average this is very welcome demonstrates that a

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.550
 country that is increasingly using the economy so

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.140
 congratulations to the economic team talking about it I saw a video of May number 1 was

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.780
 being dawn today nothing the companion made a law making a vagina

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.890
 I know that someday someone will do something stupid that old company will

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.750
 disclosing never advocated and if this my action that I always do

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.540
 not complying people are there at the exit and in the

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:18.140
 arrival and dawn so there was a pastor said a prayer

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:26.580
 after talking quickly to the press and when I spoke paulo guedes

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.150
 the economy is 10 when I was going to complete a lightning strike right

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.610
 right next to us is not really scared but it is worth watching this

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.210
 this video is because i think raul posto ipiranga

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.470
 I talked about economics 10 and talking about politics after the note for politics, but no

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.120
 time was not even hilarious but really that exit that we from

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:55.500
 dawn here that metal grid and a hose rainy season is a danger

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:03.900
 really all right the news i talked to the ambassador and lesto was yesterday by

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.770
 Brazil first accompanied the United States on the issue of the embargo

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:14.310
 for vats then we are in favor of that one

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.810
 democracy is not a dictatorship so it has to be treated as such

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:28.320
 Brazil is changing its position but the center-right is more focused as I said

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.420
 last week that my government is more democratic than your knowledge

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.190
 over the past few years you've come to talk and social control of the media

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:44.670
 there is no capital letter left this is all defending the squid in the past

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.900
 defending today the squid who wanted social control of the media

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.860
 now it was bad with this magazine, you know, there is no official budget for them anymore

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.190
 the mamata is over then this beauty has to criticize even has to say a

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:00.870
 lot of zucchinis my mirror and even so did not deliver any action as

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:06.450
 this magazine the extremely democratic government like our ronaldo right

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:12.150
 walking military college of são paulo walking quite publicized some

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.850
 videos but the work in a marketing field right

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:19.680
 for now on paper still basically but doing well if god wants we will have a

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:25.320
 good military school from brazil there in the field of mars in são paulo are 13

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.280
 colleges I think the 13th college the essence here and

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.180
 a year that has been doing everything for some other state does not have a military college and

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.420
 of the army we don’t implement it on the other hand

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:43.560
 congratulations to a minister opened an advantage in education for his project

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.630
 of school five military men the example comes from the governments of goiás and

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:54.030
 Amazons that have one that has a 10-year week term because more

00:07:54.030 --> 00:08:00.480
 this school five military and even the sef has a school giving 100% to kids

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:07.980
 no matter where there is discipline there will be kia about kids goes away

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:13.680
 we now clearly want you to have good grades because it helps our brazil the

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.940
 future continuing there says something fishing a subject a small subject before

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:25.320
 the fear is that 3 ac ap ce time wants to lower the tax on the ration itself to

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:30.090
 fish farming because I said capital our psyche culture has all the

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:36.000
 potential to grow and the cost brazil knows that it is very high

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.820
 so one of the proposals we are talking about the fourth dialogue with sectors to

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:46.800
 psiculture asks us, right, the culture, the people who grow fish

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:52.350
 they ask for an equalization law as well as there are benefits for the

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:58.080
 chicken pra e also proposed eu - a reduction of the pis and confines

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:04.680
 so we delivered a draft bill from deputy luiz nishimori that is

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:10.320
 rewriting and will present it in the chamber to benefit all

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:16.110
 rural producers reminding the captain today the apsi culture is also carried out

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:21.450
 many family farmers who grow other than fish in their

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:25.380
 property was competitive end of the law but it seems to me i took notice

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:31.170
 now maybe even paulo war the economy after the ordinance will decrease if

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:36.750
 imposed and maybe i'm sure you're welcome to stimulate the mind

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:42.329
 who wants to produce fish in Brazil in parallel, right? We are facilitating the

00:09:42.329 --> 00:09:47.130
 construction of pch brasil small hydroelectric plants where according to

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:52.680
 embrapa is the water mirror of more or less 1 hectare produces 10 to 15

00:09:52.680 --> 00:10:00.360
 tons of tilapia we have money we have cases of is overpopulation of

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:05.760
 up to 100 tons per hectare ie the superintensive is really a

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:14.149
 technology that requires oxygen are very careful with is diseases but there are is

00:10:14.149 --> 00:10:19.560
 cultivation and superintensive already active in Brazil

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:25.290
 you come back to ppgq bock the question of culture no one more than we want

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:30.630
 a culture knew in brazil that healthy make it clear here until she interprets

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:35.250
 majority of the population that has to have a government has served the interests of

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.920
 majority of the population is already in the official union diary

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:43.410
 today roberto alvim is secretary of culture for

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:51.019
 example and how osmar terra is says that his ministry is a little overwhelmed

00:10:51.019 --> 00:10:55.740
 he made the request for us we did not pass the culture on to the ministry of

00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:00.160
 tourism so it will be roberto alone in

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:05.920
 in front of culture and above it so I think about it, it's tourism, so good luck

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:10.210
 roberto alvim just like he does with all the ministers and

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:15.100
 the boys do it with their secretary away following a diet 13 roberto

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:22.750
 alone will have carte blanche to make the right people is part of the

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:29.850
 culture secretary from now on and good luck god accompany you

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:34.120
 curiosity, right, we didn't talk about artificial intelligence

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.710
 in Brazil a long time ago, when everyone started

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:43.420
 develop this subject our dear minister but sources from the ministry of

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:49.240
 tech army just opened 8 artificial intelligence lab

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.920
 so we are concerned with this and we will carry this proposal forward

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.180
 that only those who have technology can really dream of a better future

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.990
 for your country another subject here itamaraty a

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:06.700
 proposal for a reaction from a regional captain today

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:14.320
 exist in almost ten regional fisheries organizations worldwide and the

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:18.730
 brazil especially the southern cone for you have an argentine uruguay idea and

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:24.070
 Brazil share more than 40 fishing resources, ie fish that stay

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:28.810
 migrating and seafood that was migrating between countries however not

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:32.500
 we have an agreement to know the statistics to have better studies and

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.990
 even safeguarding human life

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:42.850
 safeguarding human life or even fisheries management then yesterday in

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:48.880
 itamaraty is we had a mercosur meeting here with all the members and

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:55.540
 we made the presentation of this proposal they will analyze it but it will be approved

00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:01.810
 by all the members not even the members who have no ocean is have to

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:06.850
 vote but Paraguay immediately supported the Uruguayan and Argentine proposal

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:13.930
 were to analyze is a country with brazil the huge coast

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:21.590
 when when you saw 8,500 of 509 it's boundary knot to link double

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:28.070
 17 are close to 17 thousand kilometers 7,500 km of coastline hydrographic basins to

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:32.600
 will river speaks Amazon region we will not even

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:40.070
 talk about the planet it's almost a we almost don't have a country of water of water here

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:44.870
 fish farming has been forgotten in Brazil in the past without a doubt fisheries management

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:53.930
 that we pass today Brazil is a country of coast and coast and of disagreements for

00:13:53.930 --> 00:14:00.110
 its its potential to starve in this country in some people may

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:05.350
 train others with the animal okay know about isolation okay but a country

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:11.480
 could fix it by investing more by stimulating fish consumption in the

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:17.600
 Brazil is astonished if it goes hungry in Brazil if it sees a small power station

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:23.060
 hydroelectric plant we will have to have embrapa technology points is 10 to

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:27.590
 15 tons imagine how many people can eat

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:32.960
 of a water soccer field just because school meals couldn’t

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.830
 someone to study the possibility - class to consume fish the old man without a doubt

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:40.730
 none is even one of the proposals that we send through a letter

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:45.170
 for all governors, except for rondônia, which is already

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:49.570
 practiced in school meals they use fish is the difficulty

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:56.090
 first production captain is then the governments have a little bit of difficulty in

00:14:56.090 --> 00:15:00.710
 however there is the artisanal fisherman there is a small psicultor producer

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:06.200
 close to schools and that can process the fillet is eller and without any problem

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:11.150
 of thorn for the kids and what they need is to feed on fish

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:16.130
 first one that is a wonderful protein a lean protein and brazil has a

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:21.140
 big project a big problem also with obesity so the protein instead

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:26.079
 of the kids like frying potatoes how sweet it is you have to eat not

00:15:26.079 --> 00:15:32.410
 be chubby in the past is a little bit just the chubby chubby yarn

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:40.769
 yummy the exogenous area about it

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:46.329
 we finished ended I don't have nor now the second page Sunday in the week

00:15:46.329 --> 00:15:48.819
 last Sunday last that the proof of the enemy without

00:15:48.819 --> 00:15:54.939
 problems for the mec time the minister mentally embraced and had the wording not

00:15:54.939 --> 00:16:00.309
 there is a database, you are looking for a theme, right, so we had our participation and 10

00:16:00.309 --> 00:16:04.529
 of any knowledge but the topic was no longer that controversial topic recalls

00:16:04.529 --> 00:16:09.879
 language I don’t know whose I don’t know what writing [ __ ] stimulating not even

00:16:09.879 --> 00:16:13.720
 kids are interested in that subject that leads nowhere I

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:19.779
 I hope to come back to the next newsroom, of course, more scientific technical issues, right?

00:16:19.779 --> 00:16:24.850
 even cultural ones that matter to all of us, not one particularity of

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:30.369
 a culture and also certain issues that the press felt were missing

00:16:30.369 --> 00:16:34.869
 that she says that to dispute an example is the following about issues

00:16:34.869 --> 00:16:39.220
 that the first time there was no correction on this subject, which belongs to the company that

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:44.350
 there is no misinformation and hiring this matter was just a lie so no

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:51.660
 there was misinformation in the collections in addition to the last choice about the enemy

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:58.649
 another thing is 100% cnpq scholarships and were released

00:17:00.449 --> 00:17:08.230
 a little bit with the economy coming back to china just enabled 79 new

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:13.899
 plants from santa catarina turned largely to the question of the export of

00:17:13.899 --> 00:17:20.230
 our wonderful swine share importing that the wonderful people was

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:26.569
 a serious problem passed the swine flu swine flu for china

00:17:26.569 --> 00:17:33.139
 marcelo china is when we are now the african pecha right they are

00:17:33.139 --> 00:17:39.710
 are decimating practically 30% of their pigs and need to buy pigs and

00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:45.710
 the state of santa catarina is the state of the fish also the state of the pig is has this

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:49.970
 potential our state andré has this great potential that is suffering a

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:53.840
 part of china’s need so congratulations to santa catarina

00:17:53.840 --> 00:18:01.429
 we had japan we worked approaching the use according to us as well as opening

00:18:01.429 --> 00:18:07.190
 space our meat as there is space for home in australia the

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:12.440
 south korea is on the same path and we had three countries there is from the arab world

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:17.539
 is first it was the united arab emirates qatar and saudi arabia

00:18:17.539 --> 00:18:22.610
 we have all signed an agreement with inter in a protocol of intention is also

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:29.090
 they really want to import what we produce in the field largely until

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:34.730
 for your food security this is very good for Brazil is a

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:38.990
 country man is smiling happily i'm sure they are more happy with the

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:43.129
 government policy if me and our mass

00:18:43.129 --> 00:18:49.220
 tereza cristina b as ricardo salles on the environmental issue we must inspect

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:55.700
 alright but I felt without being in a Shiite way the correction of the Indians they want

00:18:55.700 --> 00:19:00.919
 more and more to be incorporated into society we are working sense I depend

00:19:00.919 --> 00:19:05.690
 of me is a book will make the land that a farmer was 10 other land over there

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:09.169
 on the side that the Indian is a human being like we already talked a lot about it

00:19:09.169 --> 00:19:14.240
 if not working hard in that sense the sovereign fund of arabia

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:19.370
 Saudi will invest 10 million elderly people in Brazil in the next months I started to

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:25.759
 week with my fish is that the attacker neymar the fish is you are not to you da

00:19:25.759 --> 00:19:31.159
 ask that I have been my fish is what is possible we will invest if more

00:19:31.159 --> 00:19:37.940
 of 100,000 infrastructure the railway modal has to return to work at

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:43.630
 work and before me when all the transport of the do

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:48.730
 that takes place in the field also addressing the issue here capital yesterday to do the

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:54.850
 united nations food organization turned 40 in brazil had

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:59.860
 a solemn audience there in the chamber we had there honoring them so I want

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:04.480
 congratulate you to take advantage of the live of the Lord to congratulate fao we have

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:09.040
 great partnerships there at the fishing secretariat with consultancy and studies on the

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:13.960
 hug and Brazilian culture a hug there for the zavala who is the representative of fao

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.410
 here in brazil something else was presented before not in

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:23.830
 sen proposed pec amendment to the constitution that deals with the pact

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:29.440
 federative and these pieces are sponsored by senators is not the

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:34.000
 federal government I just joined the team with the other said that paulo

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:42.730
 war to better make this pact is not my proposal from the senator but I

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:47.560
 I sign below endorsing the proposal is one that caused a great controversy has the

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:53.250
 do with the municipalities then in the proposal appeared as

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:57.490
 municipalities with less than five thousand inhabitants with income with collection

00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:02.230
 own less than 10 percent of total revenue will be incorporated by the

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:04.990
 another municipality is not it is not quite like that and by seniors here

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:09.160
 logically, the congress will improve the proposal of the team senators

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:14.140
 economic but let's assume that the municipality has a flavor is the number of

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:18.280
 low is not consistent with reality no one has less than that but a

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:23.050
 million reais per year the municipality's revenue if the municipality was not

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:27.990
 responsible for 10% of that 100 thousand the municipality has to cease to exist

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:33.940
 this the intention some are saying that I want me

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:40.550
 I want where it is possible to taste I am not that guy who does it like this

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:44.510
 is is the thing will continue to exist on the spot

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:49.760
 if the parliament agrees with this, it is not in these jaguars those senators who signed the

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:54.950
 that will enforce our final proposal of the line, right

00:21:54.950 --> 00:22:01.870
 but there will be an agreement there after five years in the municipality does not have an income

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:08.780
 greater than 10% in the municipality that 90 percent of its revenue comes from the

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:13.010
 participation of the municipality for the love of god it is not even possible to pay the councilors

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:18.650
 that the municipality does then the idea is not to pursue anyone but if the municipality that

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:24.680
 go back to being a capital district where there was a video on this topic and a boy did

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:31.700
 a video and showed the savings that would be made is right with extinction of

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:38.750
 prefectures secretaries officials if really if this is went on then

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:42.800
 The economy for Brazil really is very large and for the citizens themselves and

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:48.200
 for Brazil really if the project goes ahead the mayor has and has

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.070
 perfect favorable to the company gives space to mayor just contrary to

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:55.310
 trying to hit me is all the time hit me first

00:22:55.310 --> 00:23:02.570
 mayor the proposal I sign below but it is the senators now continue

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:07.520
 living in this way the municipality produces nothing if

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:13.010
 state of the union discourse transfer is complicated on average we want the good

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:16.520
 the city has many councilors some already speak to me are also

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:22.340
 favorable sometimes the staff that the municipality manages to make its own revenue

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:27.830
 it is not possible to pay the legislative power, much less the executive of the

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:36.610
 municipality participation of nery keys already existed have a problem and help

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:40.790
 curiosity is like the municipality of brazil

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:47.300
 I will not speak because it is 160 thousand square kilometers

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:53.230
 he is from rio de janeiro there are 14 43 to 44 rio de janeiro that is worth the

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:57.280
 also american county passed here if i went wrong here please someone is

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:02.830
 being used here in santa catarina 95 thousand square kilometers

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:11.230
 I know that the double 95 of the 190 thousand is almost equivalent to the almost two Santa Catarina

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:16.660
 gives a gift high same curiosity just is very difficult some 100 thousand inhabitants

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:22.030
 okay that touch the boat and speak in tokai the boat captain present from your

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:26.559
 back already got it clear the pope knew there is a motorcycle that they will ride

00:24:26.559 --> 00:24:31.960
 boat on the lake then the is so good right I didn't see the reporter there I came here to

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.140
 damn it was really cool to say that this is

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:40.480
 so the sheet of são paulo talking on the phone captain present of the association

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:45.429
 of fishermen and shellfish gatherers from valença in bahia look what a present

00:24:45.429 --> 00:24:52.320
 beautiful that you won in honor of our artisanal fisherman and was the

00:24:52.320 --> 00:25:00.100
 george of the hour that was there in our office and the canoe the channel the homeland

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:04.960
 loved in your honor my many thanks to cane canoe

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.049
 we are receiving a very happy gift with this one will stay here in

00:25:08.049 --> 00:25:11.950
 exhibition here and when I leave I will not take home a personal touch and

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:20.380
 of the painting they say, you know, he said he had a girlfriend when

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:25.570
 a million reais you go around here at dawn all right let's play the

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:30.280
 the boat touches the boat however it died here it’s running out because in a little while there’s a

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:37.059
 game of botafogo the stove is not only the flamengo of piauí in adapting our

00:25:37.059 --> 00:25:40.929
 flamengo is big in piauí the palm trees have to run after

00:25:40.929 --> 00:25:44.410
 the stove is going to play for real today let's do the following script of piauí

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:48.040
 culture respecting the piauí they used to give me a teaspoon but

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.760
 when the flamengo from the river the flamengo of course the stove will start breaking today

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:57.130
 for that it seems to me that it has been ten years that the Flemish does not win the botafogo at home

00:25:57.130 --> 00:26:01.179
 today we're going to break that paradigm into something else I want to place a bet

00:26:01.179 --> 00:26:03.280
 with you if the Flemish does not win the Brazilian

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.679
 this year ok i dye my hair green in

00:26:06.679 --> 00:26:11.179
 tribute to the palm trees ok i'm rooting for the flamenco in liberadores

00:26:11.179 --> 00:26:16.789
 I'm even thinking about going to the turkey who would say the thigh and the sock comes takes the

00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:22.100
 game will be more in chile who knows it will not be the future will speak

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:29.659
 that I have an air force plane is what if there was an album already marked anima

00:26:29.659 --> 00:26:35.770
 everything is not marked but cheering for the tv even if i left the top of the

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:40.580
 guaratinguetá is like a straight line its são paulo brazil a retraction of appears a

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:50.240
 door of a botafogo game in that the problem of botafogo 1 to 0 and we will see the

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.929
 that happens in rio de janeiro and the problem capital is the following just for

00:26:53.929 --> 00:26:58.669
 finalize the subject of football our flamenco friends the nation

00:26:58.669 --> 00:27:05.090
 asks if the palmeirense started traveling to the whole world delivers the shirt of the

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:10.610
 Flemish for world leaders the moment there who was paying a visit

00:27:10.610 --> 00:27:14.899
 to that country is the Flemish is the best team of the moment of the moment in a good moment

00:27:14.899 --> 00:27:20.870
 moment and I'm sure everyone is rooting for the Flemish at the end

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:26.659
 here with the argentine team at the end of the month now so the intention was this

00:27:26.659 --> 00:27:31.730
 promoting Flemish yes Flemish is that it really looks like it will not be just the

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:36.230
 cheirinho will be the champion of liberadores and the Brazilian will also

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:39.740
 well that felipe melo said that it will not belong to the prisoner it cannot be only from the prisoner

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:44.270
 liberators only depend on us the eighth game will end in a little while

 Brasilia capital today also, besides your birthday, Father Cano is from

 general villas-boas is a man who has already left the reserved space in the history of

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:17.950
 national hero is had his participation in the back here guaranteed the law order by

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:20.920
 the occasion of the impeachment vote in 2016

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:27.370
 congratulations lagoons padre paulo at home already good villas is a

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:29.710
 health problem we know that for God everything is

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:36.100
 possible to bury the mother asks God whenever she performs a miracle in the newspaper

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:41.230
 reported a man that today his birthday was voiceless

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:46.240
 But he doesn't complain about anything. It's always been days. I spoke to him next.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:55.000
 its 69 years works if god wants the Flemish is finished taxing the sun

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:01.570
 this wave seems to be catching is this decision to leave defined by aneel

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:05.950
 national electric energy agency since 2015

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:10.660
 the agencies are independent but even so it is

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:17.230
 they talk to the government through the ministry of mines and energy which is a

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:22.030
 great blessing working for this taxation right

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:29.470
 at first it ceased to exist is what they claim that whoever beat up solar

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:35.559
 photovoltaic plates to generate energy for society it can sell

00:30:35.559 --> 00:30:41.320
 energy when it sells energy this surplus energy enters the current ribbon

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:47.110
 in the physical transmission medium and has to pay for the maintenance of two months which

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:50.950
 it's happening depend on me just because it's saving energy not

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:55.919
 worked in 2001 but that's okay

00:30:56.470 --> 00:31:00.820
 the proposal is a solar energy your property

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:05.919
 boot will cost zero okay if you want to sell

00:31:05.919 --> 00:31:10.240
 then when it comes to selling, you do something to sell you will have to deliver a place

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:15.190
 then it may be that we stay, it may be that we identify daniel's proposal

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:21.970
 we really hope that it will be carried out successfully that we have to have this

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:25.000
 energy that alternative solar energy source that everyone can have

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.590
 anywhere i've been i've been to japan i've been to korea

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:34.450
 from the south especially two years ago with lorenzoni onyx my three children who were

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:39.429
 in the pre campaign we will not even see that those people have a school I saw that the school

00:31:39.429 --> 00:31:45.280
 had the energy had already given photovoltaic plates and the intention basically to

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:50.470
 show kids this possibility to put on his head you have to look for this

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:56.080
 source of energy because that country in particular and has few other sources of

00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:00.669
 energy like solar is one to be present now nobody has more in the

00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:06.760
 Brazil than that the country here is a part of it at the starting equator

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:13.490
 the next one helps a lot in this monthly energy source we have hydraulic

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:18.320
 we have the wind power states like ceará for example is quite advanced in

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:22.429
 power generation we have biomass and we have the most terrible

00:32:22.429 --> 00:32:29.960
 of all is that this is that of oil are until tomorrow is that you can see a

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:35.840
 indigenous problems we are looking for a way to start building in the current

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:44.960
 year the lion and tucuruí to the lion that goes from manaus to life because we
