 one of them is the issue of landing taxes that were not previously

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.060
 empowered by the ministry of agriculture ie now the fishermen

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.910
 have the place to unload their fish without having problems with the quality of that

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.060

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.569
 fish reach the Brazilian consumer it will be much closer

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.590
 including already widely used in all countries of the world and Brazil

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:28.160

 use of pieces of fish what about the name of jesus the fish already

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.520
 hooked on the high seas well the shark seeing bigger fish and dies of it caught and the

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.240
 fisherman bring this fish as it was partially remodeled to

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.220
 previous legislation required that this fish be discarded so now with

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.570
 due is sanitary treatment you can use part of pedaling fish

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:16.820
 unbelievable we are forgiving needing since modernization in life who wants

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.690
 produce and here Brazil leaves the situation room

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.360
 you find it is comfortable in April it is difficult to reproduce something

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.750
 brazil hello water so i said we added it now in july and this

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.820
 present aquaculture is celebrating because after this sanction from the lord

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:46.330
 of that law 14,000 zero eleven is the water assignment procedures than

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.880
 what waters in the union captain those water bodies sea federal rivers and we

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.490
 we can give the possibility for fish farmers to cultivate in a net-tank a

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.490
 fish to be able to produce fish and anti it is before this law that its

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.979
 worked it took up to 24 months for us from the close secretariat to be able to give this

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:13.479
 document for him to have legality in production if his eyes see 24 months

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:19.660
 up to 36 months and now with this is we won because the bidding is over now

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.580
 it is a direct session so if the bolsonaro files a lawsuit I give in to the

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.680
 bolsonaro before bolsonaro if you already had to open a bid

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.330
 to see if I was interested in the area, it’s complicated a lot and now we

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:39.410
 we gained 12 months and have time to be from that area to the farmer and through

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:44.890
 normative instruction 19 that we publish now the thirteenth is duly

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.490
 cleared by our fish farmers at the height of producers all over the world

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.110
 water the federal university of pará speaks to

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.759
 people stay so we have a fishing engineer named kleber santos and his

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:36.820
 advisor doctor mileide morais who developed a canning is natural

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:41.300
 through the tucupi fruit that is well known in several states

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.970
 Brazilians dispense with the use of chemical products dispense with the use of

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:53.240
 of preservative because the tucupi through its acidity it already gives a longevity

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.880
 for fish that is used in preserves so we want to congratulate and

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.789

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:08.900
 university of pará and we want to leave a big hug and congratulate you on

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.160
 a big hug deserves someone who

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:20.810
 Brazilian has a very fertile head, right and does things that we doubt

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:27.550
 logically what is developed there that facilitates

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:34.510
 so the old gate the text case is going is that the shrimp now see how

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:40.510

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:52.560
 hug thank you can leave here now a little bit earlier question

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:58.910
 what comes to the step of the young pan radio more people good news here look

00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:04.980
 inss ask for proof of life by facial recognition on cell phone no

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:09.930
 we know of the difficulty of making the expression life test one of the most

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:15.660
 elderly the displacement it has to be an ambulance quite complicated

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:22.889
 after taking is aware that the elderly he is is the suspended attention his

00:08:22.889 --> 00:08:27.780
 salad bowl life its weight.what now in this one

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.800
 I'm doing facial recognition to start doing it to do the proof of

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.310
 life anything you to schedule security and with the wife not yet

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:40.200
 I passed security is not released and the wagner gives more agility in the process

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.700
 then talk about corruption here only he intercalating right recreational he here is

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:49.710
 because in Brazil since the news there in the press always right to enjoy it here

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:55.530
 talk to you use the we know the defense last week i told you guys right i

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:59.389
 I replied and you will take a line I saw

00:08:59.389 --> 00:09:05.130
 some the other put the drilling position here

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:09.480
 even because I wanted to go until I changed a mess the company ended up allowing

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:15.720
 Even Paulo Guedes, the market was nervous of ours, he saw the stock market fell

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:21.090
 total confusion until now much of the company doesn’t have I have zeal or

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:26.160
 concern with the news with the truth assist the news like that a lie

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:31.640
 fake news causes market stability so did not avoid responding

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.260
 the questions because I know that at the end of the job not

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:41.560
 and the games of traditional companies there want the mind and confusion in the game

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:49.520
 quick and feel free huh i think the choice of minister of

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:55.550
 present the state disbelieving banks here a different criterion from that of

00:09:55.550 --> 00:10:00.260
 third party nomination helped a lot to fight corruption in brazil avoid

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:07.520
 helped a lot to prevent fluorescence from happening here in Brazil ok so the

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.950
 current government has done something else here maybe this knowledge everybody who

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:17.300
 the prevention that sends in here well days some cooking space

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:23.630
 let's find a resident doctor the government has been taking many measures of them is that the

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:29.930
 yours took over in January 19 right then it's your your first big change I think

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:34.400
 that this break and the choice by specific technical criteria of the ministers this

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.980
 changed the reality a lot but you did it right away in the first

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:44.760
 first 60 65d he publisher governments already a standard that brought criteria

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:50.030
 what is more expensive we have 84 1470 positions in the federal public administration

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:54.060
 all of them freely appointed that you for the first time in history

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:58.680
 innovated and created rules for the occupation of these positions rules with criteria of

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.550
 more moral area of ​​their general criteria of duality of these people and also

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:06.390
 minimum technical criteria rules for these people will be able to buy everything

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:10.980
 that obviously directly influenced corruption on the day we take 20 months

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:15.690
 be the case of the body, I only fight because we have a previous filter that

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:18.990
 come from anybody up the stairs and let's go has made a huge difference

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:23.820
 in that time your signed a decree with preservation of whistleblowers identity

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:28.200
 allowing people to report corruption cases and not have their

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:34.320
 leaked names right and putting the visa these people and risks you synonymous

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:40.560
 important is normative along with aggeo ending the secrecy of public banks

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.440
 banks formerly lent the money nobody knew hitting lent

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:47.739
 partner money is a similar deluxe took binding

00:11:47.739 --> 00:11:52.689
 adoption intending to open this data April aid payment data

00:11:52.689 --> 00:11:57.339
 emergency so raining increasing the transparent by all measures comes

00:11:57.339 --> 00:12:01.420
 contributing for the federal government today to reach an interesting mark that

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:06.129
 is the not to be of corruption of the present government is the presence interests for

00:12:06.129 --> 00:12:11.529
 nice people the corrupt at the end of the line we’re interested in preventing him from practicing

00:12:11.529 --> 00:12:16.629
 production they divert public resources so so to a feeling many

00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:21.850
 athletic so public times there is only combat so you see squeeze be

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.089
 more knocking on the door with someone yes this promotions keep happening and

00:12:25.089 --> 00:12:28.590
 g1 control

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:34.170
 okay for sure that we only during this period of knowing from 19 to

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.950
 each and there were 111 joint operations with the federal police as a form with the

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:41.820
 general controllership of the union but only talking is preventive I will call

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:46.680
 attention to listen to a folded fabric stitches comes to work is the government has

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.070
 implementing the integrity program in all agencies are programs that

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:55.650
 seek to detect prevent and identify corruption risks and edit that this

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:59.820
 way that these risks are realized all this work for us we are already

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.060
 with management units finish ninety-eight percent of the organs of the

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:09.210
 federal public administration 85 always has an action plan and even the

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:12.600
 beginning of December in the week of fighting corruption within the will catch on without

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.920
 percent of the government with the plans working this is a legacy you leave it will

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:21.390
 help combat mission both in the problem you against the future

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:27.690
 corruption also our government has been cleaning up, you know, a good job in

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:34.290
 Regarding the seizure of drugs and armaments from May to now, I am not the PRF

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:45.030
 a piece tripled drug seizure and it's a cocaine tank leaf picked up the

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:50.140
 good armament so obviously it is we have

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:54.790
 disseminate on social networks and we are proud of the work of these two institutions that

00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:59.380
 at the end of the line, it gives a feeling that we are

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.150
 similarly avoiding which drugs within Brazil that breastfeed these

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:10.230
 it is very porous ours yes our coast the 10 countries put in the mass of life in

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:14.910
 ten countries a puddle of 8,500 km of 200 really quite will complete its most

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:19.650
 We are working a lot on this type, right? I see the federal highway police

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:23.720

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:02.090
 I'm sure that soon we are young people more aware of what is the

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:07.130
 public resource of the value that is the payment of taxes and application of

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:12.110
 every resource from the government and the i'm sure we'll be able to do

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:15.110
 with that the federal government has a polishing age that corruption exists

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:19.760
 but that society as a whole changes and that the country's structure is

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:23.930
 on the plane always looking like a return to education dies it gets more or less

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:27.140
 that's another partnership with instituto maurício de sousa and in a playful way

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:32.420
 using the group of monica then one ear two cards see the film the

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:36.770
 yours also lets you pass it to me that i will show here and next week

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:40.850
 and shows around who shows the first

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:45.589
 thursday of the 1st that is right the table ready you spoke mind working right

00:16:45.589 --> 00:16:50.330
 it's not destroyed because writing the class exactly we already met next week

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:53.270
 with minister milton to see if we can put all the

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:57.050
 pnld portfolios and our flakes will arrive let's see how it looks it has

00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:01.670
 to talk to wilson and what is his suggestion to return to

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:06.380
 classes come here i will do brazilian academic if you did it right that

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:12.800
 of the thing is the naval school has not stopped its advantages is to continue has a problem

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:19.939
 it's not right you guys so here I had this week last week in the region

00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:26.690
 jehovah's law hi people will inaugurate something

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:34.400
 another feels the population and we go there to inaugurate on the radar

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:38.750
 this radar is of interest to us going to the bar is placed for one yesterday more

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:43.700
 two to be installed after reason another agreed point so that will

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:49.450
 the entire border with paraguay and bolivia will be, right now, it's on the radar

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:56.840
 he is aided by another in the radar network, he takes up to 150 km, so these planes

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:02.930
 that bring a list from outside, it’s good to be plotted and to wish the visionary radar

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:10.010
 and who was the radio that has how many you don't have here according to the

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:14.030
 information there they participate here that one there it comes to be intercepted

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:19.910
 so the strength she Brazil is to be congratulated I'm dating do not fight there half of

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:24.740
 side in brazil create a table also when i liked the word i started to

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:30.590
 suffering Christ Pantanal is on fire it's true it will be nice there even in

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:35.390
 much higher proportions were in the past is only critical and wants an action

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:39.290
 well it’s to put out the boot’s fire so come on guys it was covered here

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:44.039
 wetland size 150 thousand kilometers gives

00:18:44.039 --> 00:18:50.759
 lunch is equivalent to losing quickly right, he 150,000 than ours

00:18:50.759 --> 00:18:55.470
 square is 94 state together I placed rio de janeiro sergipe rio grande do

00:18:55.470 --> 00:19:02.340
 north alagoas so you can imagine the difficulty you fought the fire in this

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:08.789
 area in that area logically the strength it was there you the other means ibama

00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:14.429
 there were the state brigades and some municipalities as well but it is an area of

00:19:14.429 --> 00:19:19.739
 man of man I talked to ricardo states now little right market

00:19:19.739 --> 00:19:26.519
 another because the difficulty the legend of for huge ok is forbidden you

00:19:26.519 --> 00:19:31.679
 it started to be forbidden to raise the free cattle right then the cattle just because they lived passing

00:19:31.679 --> 00:19:37.049
 create a large quantity that is worth the way always goes brigadeiro is all the

00:19:37.049 --> 00:19:40.739
 party here on the committee here in certain areas year after loves like

00:19:40.739 --> 00:19:47.440
 clean cover there dry and lifeless and when there is the fire that now

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:52.060
 it's above average temperature above 40 degrees so there is spontaneous combustion

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:58.320
 when it catches fire it goes away even more, right according to geological issues

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:06.700
 the use of preventive use of fire is prohibited, you have already had your

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:11.920
 image of ibama's car burning fire on the track i'll do it justice when i saw it

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.760
 that scared me will have to see if I called was to cause that that is this is a

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.950
 controlled way to combat I brought that if you wait for the fire to be asked,

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:26.140
 he comes she doesn’t have to represent you as a preventative

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:30.430
 much bigger so because of that an ideological issue calling for fire

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:35.800
 preventive the other side happens brings us a proportion is very good then that

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:39.730
 he hangs from ibama who has been thinking about his whole life playing fornazza pizzeria

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:44.770
 it is exactly to avoid a greater evil in the future here to end today it did not come and

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:50.680
 poisonous snake the guy who throws the jacket you want I already did here is the people

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:58.090
 native of the region who usually makes their gardens as a result of this is also the guy who

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:02.200
 makes a silo on the fence he usually dries out the maximum of the drought and touches fire

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:06.730
 little has one has a day will catch on fire when you catch it and do not reach to be

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:12.400
 until everyone dies early and there is also a lot of pressure for them to

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:17.920
 do not use fire retardant so aircraft when pouring pure water

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:22.840
 it was quickly it now when it comes with retardant it takes longer than second

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:30.580
 ricardo soares huh i'm not a stone mediated delaying access is tantamount to

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:37.290
 50,000 liters play rectangle and do what you can but you who are the well

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:42.960
 will continue to put the blame on me the fire in the amazon the fire in the wetland

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:47.630
 but let's touch the boat it's like I never caught fire in this region and then

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:51.240
 a Spanish thing this period of the same this period of the year I have a

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.580
 complicated to work again at a temperature above 40 degrees nothing

00:21:55.580 --> 00:22:02.490
 makes it much easier while even understanding a bottle thrown there and the culture of

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:07.430
 champagne ask for a lens for anything can happen letter

00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:13.820
 it's true brazil i didn't have a shaman in rio de janeiro from two places we visited

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:20.460
 a lita belt school is but I didn’t accept the classics of the to

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:26.880
 long until the end of 2002 that a symbol is of quality where it comes in here

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:32.419
 discipline and you who did that like I give gives

00:22:32.419 --> 00:22:36.289
 to put in the classroom as it is impossible and to curl up their own

00:22:36.289 --> 00:22:40.700
 colleagues at the beginning I cut this expelled is expelled right

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:46.280
 I happen, it happens, it is common to happen for four years or two

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:51.440
 colleagues be pasting time and so it will expel the days off turned on and

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:56.210
 turned off the gym because that one of us accompanies you all your life

00:22:56.210 --> 00:23:00.790
 functional identity that hole she and even the colleague himself ended up showing

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:06.290
 by chance that boy there she seeing a girl does not stick here then

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:11.409
 antenna here to have discipline and then you go forward the wagner who

00:23:11.409 --> 00:23:15.490
 they gym she example i also did close to him and after that i'm a

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:19.509
 function is already be one will be from another kitten for how many candidates were

00:23:19.509 --> 00:23:22.650
 sixty and you

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:28.769
 the kissed lobster saw what is the higher education and I answer you

00:23:28.769 --> 00:23:35.940
 145 thousand tec thank you contest for academy also sin and when i did

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:41.669
 and with 38 vacancies, 40 thousand candidates, that's fine, everybody is that if I'm not

00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:45.840
 smart we are not intelligence everybody strives to achieve the goal

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:54.690
 sky team also aracaju inaugurating a gas thermoelectric plant

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:59.360
 deserves the gas bet there from this one for him is

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:05.090
 what matters and oil there is in the past this well injected guys

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:11.250
 and not in the exchange and down there in the burned part okay

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:16.550
 now not from that support of dawn native governor of Sergipe

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:22.850
 hi paulo everything well treated said everything that happened in the state the person of your

00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:31.010
 mind he is naughty right and it was a good street going there and there you do this

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:37.150
 thermoelectric plant it manages to supply fifteen percent of that of the northeast region

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:41.030
 fifth and northeast others saw for certainty

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:47.600
 the appendix is ​​this one this one until the snot now has 16 million people to stop

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:53.850
 16 million work through the bag neighborhood

00:24:53.850 --> 00:25:01.340
 and then my case is talking about is

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:06.920
 google is tomorrow you don't work here again pedro already made some now

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:13.420
 wow this now not tomorrow i'm going to start my business or less this today was a

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:21.389
 series of things so let's watch it i don't want you to p

00:25:21.389 --> 00:25:27.880
 and that takes the people and our brother out of the northeast of the sea in a

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:34.540
 total dependence on water tankers of people who sometimes use this one

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:40.590
 in this situation hi people will be invested is in this region

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:45.600
 changes the works of that region we are dating is not it was not in the started there

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:51.450
 back to back to anyone that face use of anybody's work but was always

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:56.640
 finished decades are often finishing works which is cheaper for

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.640
 not like that and serves the population here too

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:04.640
 and so I and them

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:10.430
 and it wasn’t possible over time it’s a water here where we are it’s over there in the water

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:16.310
 will find it ended here which is just to make a comment about this one

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:20.420
 I think this is the other important point regarding the level of integrity of the

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:24.500
 cinema that matters little if the work started in that government interests there in

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:29.240
 citizen's door and it will be delivered within that plan that we

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:34.760
 regarding the previous whatsapp plans was said by the 85 thousand people

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:38.270
 live is not ending here in the protein like that but one thing that stays

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:18.190
 intelligence part we have a strategic information board

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:22.000
 within the anti-corruption secretariat as the secretariat created by the

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.070
 president of the first day of government there strategic data are collected from the

00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:31.690
 government would be the controls the public resources brave seeks to seek all the

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:38.740
 budget area what is being spent we also try to monitor

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:42.640
 requests that happen from the government we have today a robot called alice

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:47.740
 this one stole it every day he goes there in shoppingnet download the whole program

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:51.070
 it has a technology an artificial intelligence part another of

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:55.480
 text mining it fetches the keywords analysis and checks these

00:28:55.480 --> 00:29:02.020
 cases of possible cases of fraud and corruption already for the 4.1 million

00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:05.620
 hiring in this way, so in the area of ​​intelligence, we have several

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:10.340
 jobs is that bo and [ __ ] work on your data and and

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:15.190
 try to avoid wasting public resources during the pandemic

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:21.140
 specifically from Ze Maria, we’re doing a lot of intense work

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:27.800
 right we did a very manual search job in about two hundred and seventy

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:32.540
 eight states and municipalities of all public purchases managed to arrive in a

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:38.510
 average of the main products that were sold

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:42.940
 individual and general protection so we can follow this well

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:46.970
 we publish this data to allow managers to buy to make the

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:50.720
 in-price purchases have already done more than 20 operations for police

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:55.610
 federal government on this issue and to make sure that the work is being delivered to the

00:29:55.610 --> 00:30:00.530
 society testament escipio always the objective work of course objective will

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:03.650
 make the money arrive at the bridge so that society has the best

00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:07.370
 possible use of public resources all

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:13.960
 and then doing your job you know that right

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:24.179
 and I also that person who intended and where's the [ __ ] right service is good morning

00:30:24.179 --> 00:30:31.080
 of the work audience, we also call it being able to go because then

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:35.760
 prevention prevention is better to be safe than sorry I had to learn

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:39.410
 nobody writes nobody do anything wrong

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:47.680
 and there and there

00:30:48.429 --> 00:30:56.910
 and there and there

00:30:58.370 --> 00:31:01.090
 g1

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:08.330
 and there and there

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:11.450
 g1 and there

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:15.260
 and there and there

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:27.470
 and thanks for the question you better read managerial we cross-checked

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:34.220
 quite extensive data so much joint work from the controllership also that the

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:39.740
 ministry of citizenship dataprev federal savings bank right and we detect it is

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:47.330
 really many regularity cases we already have there is practically 117

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:50.990
 millions if I am not mistaken and resource that the public coffers have already returned to

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:57.620
 people returning this resource that we took about 680 thousand servers

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:03.620
 that initially received this resource, the 680 thousand times cable does not

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:07.010
 general federal public administration that we did in addition to crossover

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:11.150
 federal attention that is the basis that we have we also sought the bases of

00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:15.270
 states of the municipalities here is a small point

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:21.650
 is 680 thousand really received are servers that are part of the bases of

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:27.330
 payment of the states and municipalities that we use and the federal government here

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:31.680
 we became interns, which is a case that is no longer a server

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:36.690
 federal public but is on the basis of payment we identify is scholarship holders

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:41.430
 so we are excluding it by cleaning it there to see if it is worthwhile to see this

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:46.740
 number of people, right? We have ours at the federal level, which is ours to

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:51.390
 performance we are opening the processes we are notifying the servers

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:54.960
 servers that have already returned money will make a check with a payment term

00:32:54.960 --> 00:33:02.220
 conduct adjustment who did not answer will answer for having a

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:06.659
 resources are misused now an important point we have servers that

00:33:06.659 --> 00:33:10.950
 are appearing that their names have been used by fraudsters so we

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:14.429
 we have to be very careful to accuse your god for having the number we have

00:33:14.429 --> 00:33:19.260
 taking everybody that we crossed state, county and union are 680 thousand but

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:22.620
 I make a reservation here that this number will drop a lot when we

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:28.970
 we made a better filter of this data good thank you kiss per minute scary

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:33.000
 despite having some who had their names always used for sure

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:42.039
 that most did not control themselves and did not erase brought some and

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:50.350
 the fighters here came the last one the last layer and the calcium has no problem

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:53.070
 what's up

00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:03.140
 sometimes you have to have it earlier you have to be a violin here there to send

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:19.619
 not one of humanity and then I put lunch I stayed three ok

00:34:19.619 --> 00:34:30.230
 so I'm saying that we are not and then

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:42.169
 and there and there

00:34:42.169 --> 00:34:45.849
 what's up

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:50.129
 what's up

00:34:53.350 --> 00:35:02.820
 and beautiful is we do not have this survey yet i imagine something around

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:08.770
 34 million reais with more or less interest is going to come out is an estimate not

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:13.060
 has this closed value, I asked until it was born together in that specific area

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:18.880
 check all the benefits cut suggestion referrals that we

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:24.460
 we did and multiply expose 600 or by 1200 in the case of the mother, right?

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:29.410
 monoparental situation those frontier so what she lives alone taking care of

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:33.820
 of his children, he got double the amount, so we have to have more

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:38.110
 that yet but it is the value that I imagine will come close to those values

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:42.490
 I hope that many people that the club had this resource in a non-regular way

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:47.890
 vulvas focus to public coffers as has happened to almost 100 thousand more people

00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:52.930
 100 thousand people plus this estimate that we have now in three and four

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:55.369
 million this is how we did it number

00:35:55.369 --> 00:36:06.110
 exact I give the number to you in August two that gave a replica of the

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:15.450
 white hair there and there

00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:17.860
 and there and there

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:32.480
 this is it, I will not make one and then

00:36:32.480 --> 00:37:00.730
 and then and thank you is the money and returns the

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:04.990
 public glasses right and it is available in the single treasury account for the

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:09.340
 use there for payments made, right from the events

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:12.460
 that will happen in the different areas when it comes to the payment phase of

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:16.420
 and then paid when it is due to be paid it is used in relation to the

00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:20.500
 people we're going to divide the people out there who are going to try all

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:23.349
 we are forwarding to ministry everything I do not know if it will be possible

00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:29.080
 complicated process opening a notion small values ​​but it's really

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:33.010
 going to have some kind of action now in relation to public servants we

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:37.930
 we are investigating and everyone and then the sphere of attribution to our competence as

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:42.190
 beings or is it just to be federal double has no competence to sanction

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:46.880
 state and municipal civil servants the two will respond to processes that have already

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:51.640
 returned will sign a conduct adjustment term because

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:56.000
 sometimes checked for fraud what they had asked for wrongly and already

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.200
 immediately returned each case will be analyzed in the principles that have already

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:04.550
 returned the only to have one by the will of products and the rest will be

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:10.460
 sanctioned okay one last news has now arrived here for me is very good

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:14.500

 tradition, so someone from the stone over there, I'm general in the case, right?

00:39:38.319 --> 00:39:45.099

00:39:45.099 --> 00:39:49.780
