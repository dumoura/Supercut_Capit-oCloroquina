 to be able to enter the agenda more important than education then one more

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:25.390
 Today's media story, right now and then, there are many times

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.659
 I know that I receive a lot of criticism from the beach a lot because of that so the matter

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:37.750
 that a research done by the University UERJ UFMG USP and the FS 14 universities

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.799
 saying that regular physical activity reduces hospital risk by 34 percent

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.690
 elapsed case I spoke back in my case I spoke in for my past and Athletic

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.299
 I didn't generalize if I took the invitation I didn't understand almost anything I said I

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.549
 people from the media to the mainstream media saying that I called gripezinha the collection of

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:04.430
 there is no video or audio of me speaking in this way and I spoke for

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.220
 my athletic state my past life ok i always took care of my body

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.359
 you guys always practice sports after an accident I had in the brigade

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:19.790
 parachutist or I broke both arms, two legs and the bottom right

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.700
 I said it was astral and it tightens the heel region there

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:30.240
 I really lost the condition of a top athlete in the Armed Forces and started to

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.550
 just be a football peladeiro a little touch walk every now and then

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.440
 swimming but I never stopped practicing sport just is never sedentary background

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.140
 and said that if the invitation arrives today I would feel almost nothing for my

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.880
 past and athlete it was only for fun to the side that I was belittling

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.260
 the good ones I was mocking and now I have to then bro in the publication

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.040
 finding lol like the same sheet I'm denying research talks from these four universities

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.520
 who who repeats here exercises regular physical activity reduces 34 percent the

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.040
 river without hospitalization I don't usually say I didn't hear anything

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:22.109
 I studied, I talked, stuck there, and if you have a bad x and you were affected

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:30.300
 of a Y also this is take medicine Z for evil x right and evil and it is also

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.740
 cured you don't come to the conclusion that that medicine is for the 25 right the collection

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.710
 of sub-Saharan Africa coexistence down there in the Sahara desert, very common malaria

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.479
 when the person was attended as an invitation to take a look at the face,

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:52.460
 well conclusion if baby friend friend to be soon friend to be that's not it

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.560
 Simple mathematics so the conclusion was this mocking of me called Captain and

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:04.680
 play ukulele in the now had no true alternative so if you and

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.240
 else hydroxychloroquine was used always used more used more than

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.490
 50 years here in Brazil I even spoke when I had the

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.930
 the promised that torment because because for two days it is twice

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:26.229
 a day they made electrocardiogram lie to me who spoke here at that time

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:34.120
 calm it provoked us then we saw Hamilton yes the European society of

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.330
 Cardiology said that the routine history did not cause us to lose one more

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:45.610
 losing them all I don't want you to tell me to look there he didn't kick us

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.300
 we researched I talked to a lot of people was aware of my

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.430
 responsibility for the mask collection I will not say much because it will still

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:01.569
 we have a serious study talking about the effectiveness of the dough it protects 100% 80

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:09.740
 90 1041 percent will arrive at the study, I think only the last one is okay, drop it

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.360
 and we always said we should preserve taking care older than me and mine

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:22.250
 it was here too, right, did you take that Milton looks at what I prescribed? I suggested you

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.990
 looking for a doctor I looked for a doctor because I was involved in the doctor was it worth it

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.629
 no problem i'm here the next day was fine you can come that

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:36.470
 he is seeing now he is seeing numbers now death per million inhabitants

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.930
 another country are passing by to see how Argentina passed Brazil now how does

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.530
 this collection is being treated in Argentina first we know that the

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:51.050
 lock Down It's being the most aggressive that has knowledge and we

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.490
 we see all God that a New York family saying that the vast majority of

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.960
 who got infected with the food was at home it wasn't on the street at all And another thing

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:06.110
 starting the economy now there is more to study here another one here in the

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:08.490
 Brazil you make the Institute for Economic Research

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:20.790
 american the name of the study course of the look down quickly here anxiety the

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.860
 anxiety symptoms increased the United States three times

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:30.860
 and increased by four times the symptoms of depression to depression our average

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:33.710
 nobody knows what can lead to depression than knowing a person with

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:37.189
 depression can know what it can do including kill you to death

00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:40.479
 next needs work

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.890
 and another thing here also says the study that thirteen percent of respondents

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:51.050
 said they increased their consumption of substances which is substances this is it

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:56.900
 that the drug was increased drug use Okay, another data here

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:01.520
 interesting that not understanding also happened in Brazil but I don’t know that

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.890
 percentage the food banks distributed twenty percent more he

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:11.720
 immense than in the normal month the question here someone here has increased weight this

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:18.170
 year please answered Saturday tomorrow beauty a year 22 but nobody 35 sixty

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:23.930
 percent to you or Jorge Felipe ate more tilapia to José Milton who

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:27.680
 increased what when you increase the weight and have a hangover from the health of the person finding

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:32.479
 that the most obese person who has the most fat in their blood saw I don’t know if

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:37.040
 food has more problems can be affected diseases among other things

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:42.180
 so these people were all raised here a Research Institute

00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:47.550
 American Space the same thing something similar happened in Brazil so there's

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:54.899
 people there are mayors, right, who are already talking and new confinement Lock

00:08:54.899 --> 00:09:01.110
 Down so now it’s too late so the mayor has already been repaid he was there to give

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.320
 we wake up you should have seen it for you go talking can

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.370

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:13.500
 people started the pandemic ok And he was the one who's in his head I did it

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:20.310

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:42.190

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.820
 better way your vote now in São Paulo so I'm out of this in Rio de

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:08.320
 January took notice here a stop after the second round and even just

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.610
 you put it and let's go

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:17.649
 and also here of this here 570 million and millions of people who were in poverty

00:10:17.649 --> 00:10:24.220
 extreme in the world because of the thief quickly let me see the quick turn

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.970
 come on come on national special education policy that has fast 30

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:33.220
 seconds 30 seconds come on is a view now for the people who have

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:39.459
 disability is an inclusion the inclusion but more than inclusion is a way

00:10:39.459 --> 00:10:44.560
 to take care of these people especially the children its the millions of people

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:49.350
 who have some types of being all but there are millions there at school in their

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:54.970
 Blind blind is autism problem Down syndrome 3 little nos no no

00:10:54.970 --> 00:11:00.670
 there was just to include a child playing but inside the present room we

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:06.160
 we will not let him do that we give this option we give the family the option to decide and

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:11.380
 we also created special classes here the digital diploma prescribed in our

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:15.050
 voice governments are ok and you got there did not have any study

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:19.340
 nothing more nothing nothing yet there you can it is at the beginning here but you can

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:24.140
 help get pregnant one more adventure is what it is then how did it help digital

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:29.690
 just know how many fake degrees there are out there I don't know either so the person

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:35.390
 is to hire a ceded ué brings a diploma just like signed but we do not

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:39.530
 know if real we're going to be on the Mac a bank the person is going to hire someone

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:45.920
 enters this doesn’t have in the second quarter 2021 person enters in in fact this guy is

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:51.890
 formed I already had problem with diplomacy you can see the Cubans was in the

00:11:51.890 --> 00:11:57.900
 government Dilma yes his diploma came here nobody had access

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.620
 And then I was going to tell you a lot that most of it was a pity for us

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:05.490
 Cubans now folks say I expelled the ones I’m going to from here isn’t

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:10.110
 When I was elected president, we finished one year before taking office

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:14.490
 they retreated went a lot I would like to do a

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:21.270
 test with them to know your degree of knowledge of medicine that the reports

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:25.470
 that we have reports, you know, information was that we had a lot

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:29.820
 even in the Cuban secret service were the ones who stayed here I made the commitment

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:34.260
 with him present have a revalue that we are going to do now in December the second

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:39.120
 largest group that will provide it is good to bring the diplomas are Cuban that the

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:45.300
 Cuban is the revalidate so something cool and I’m a long time stopped in Brazil now the

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:49.560
 proof is not really to say that a test is difficult is a test of its own

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.310
 check if you have knowledge of the year you teach, we cannot here even if

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.700
 that I spoke in bed the deputy as a deputy I talked a lot in bed

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.250
 all Cubans and why aren't doctors when that

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:07.150
 serves Dilma here and her ministers because the medical team doesn’t have

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:11.530
 Cuban since they’re so good so we’re giving it a go I said

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:16.750
 during the same campaign as the Cubans that the campaign was not after

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.170
 when we came to the presidency right that Cubans wanted to stay in Brazil

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:25.960
 we will give acid to this thing that the PT government didn’t do it usually

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:30.940
 when he was in the norm it’s an unbelievable Brazilian thing right that the doctor

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:35.560
 ordered if asylum example is imported by the Brazilian government is a

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:41.680
 unimaginable thing but the PT in the name of Democracy do all digital diploma in

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:52.510
 my something more PG such so I will is a January 24 final stretch we

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:57.889
 we will also have an unprecedented digital Enem this is the

00:13:57.889 --> 00:14:04.429
 a place will do it digitally if it will speed up for correction and we will have

00:14:04.429 --> 00:14:10.029
 also in particular video evidence in pounds for those who declare themselves

00:14:10.029 --> 00:14:16.249
 deaf or with some type of disability with a report preset the right to Him

00:14:16.249 --> 00:14:21.429
 first lady class is working is she doesn't just rule here I don't live there too

00:14:27.559 --> 00:14:31.639
 two tiny children and we have a special team to analyze

00:14:31.639 --> 00:14:35.720
 contents examples the books arrived a short time ago i'm taking and talks about some

00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:43.040
 relief nothing that taught nonsense to a child ended up if it happened to arrive by

 then you can report it to us let's talk here is this material out there

00:14:48.739 --> 00:14:53.389
 that we want and we are going to distribute something the last one to the children tall parents don't

 talk to companies have developed getting a type of bus with traction in the four

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:30.930
 wheels for some cases that are more difficult are number of prank calls here some

 quickly as is Piauí without without Minas Gerais 121 Minas Gerais is the state

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:41.070
 which has a greater number of municipalities without going to see where the most is here

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:48.900
 organism Santa Catarina 135 Tocantins 407 That's when São Paulo also has

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:55.380
 do not have to São Paulo He used our minutes and they bought more than 500 buses

00:15:55.380 --> 00:16:00.610
 but they used the minutes to buy with a price

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:06.970
 low and We accept but the money went from the state state government some and

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:16.060
 us What was ours from here look around Everything São Paulo was close 31 and Joana

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:19.960
 detail is this program is not just delivering some it has a cost ok course

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:26.200
 find out how you do it and this year alone 701 million President to fix the

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:30.430
 bus for comrade not to speak does not change the bus and now there will be no more

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:34.720
 nothing and the bus will stay there breaking that bill is everyone keeping it

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:39.610
 we spend on education big country 210 million inhabitants love downtown

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:42.580
 less with children are elementary school have this idea better not

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:46.860
 there are 20 million there and maybe there is no beach there are a lot of people but

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:51.260
 we spend a lot on education too now a lot of people who stay are not me

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:57.750
 complains about what is not learned now we have no way to change the education of

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:04.440
 one year to another a Paulo Freire doctrine that at the end of the line in the proof of

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:09.150
 Step among 70 countries, if I'm not mistaken 70 we are there, there must be Jesus on the 8th

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:15.260
 you get a man or 70 and the subject is usually mathematics

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:21.990
 Portuguese and sciences and in mathematics I don't have there preserves a test a

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:27.570
 simple rule of three is not composed there three composed by two men make ten

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:32.340
 meters of wall in 3 days you will any of these varied is being

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:36.210
 the complete composite company that has a direct and indirect heart a rule of

00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:43.430
 three simple, right, one dollar is worth $ 5 22 How many reais is it worth?

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:47.910
 seventy percent misses in the 9th grade of elementary school So these are numbers

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:53.310
 really scary kid time problem had the multiplication table on the ruler or

00:17:53.310 --> 00:18:00.300
 in the pencil that you had to know nowadays ok, it's also a difficult thing

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:06.090
 for a considerable number of boys who are in the area it is elementary school the

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:12.300
 which is reflected at the end of the line a workforce of ours that is formed with

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:17.070
 disability is employment time service issues that come from outside Brazil to

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:21.120
 here you don’t have it formed inside here you can see it’s good to get you

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.350
 there is none here a school I speak the name does not seem to be in trouble but

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:31.320
 there particular renowned glue teaching the language the third sex speaking

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:36.990
 Minimax Green boys and girls if we had so much bath, right?

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:41.200
 a South Korea Japan tell me you could even do a

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:45.310
 I played until I thought it was wrong to make a joke, there's a lot of attention now in

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:50.020
 open school this what it is is not earned from it now the other side we had

00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:55.570
 the collection of some 40 days the boys visiting Look at the Student's capacity

00:18:55.570 --> 00:19:02.740
 Brazilian does not understand mathematics we went if I am not mistaken second or

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:08.470
 third place in I was joining radio there in the economy we were two times voice I

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:11.590
 it was on that day the young man's Brazilian capacity is name what is it that

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:21.310
 Tom is lacking, lacking discipline, lacking hierarchy, making them really

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:25.120
 teachers can exercise their authority in the classroom over the course of

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:29.650
 last years I do you right O sends many times

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:34.630
 the actions of Justice were made by a father which is worse, you know, he took his cell phone out of

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:38.170
 the kid's hand was playing in the classroom so he could learn

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:44.160
 the father even with action against how many parents we see in the boxing in the classroom

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:48.820
 joins castle war fight this can even occur you have to take a

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:54.190
 providence to prevent going to inhibit others from doing that education Our

00:19:54.190 --> 00:20:00.660
 was dropped I usually say the education was exceptional for the purpose of the PT

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:05.710
 training militants at the end of the law was very well implemented just like the

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:09.340
 socialism in Venezuela was very well implemented so it’s a

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:14.710
 crap provocation complicated situation has to be chicken is possible right the

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:23.560
 the Enem test the first one that was denied was when 2000/2010 ok it was 2,103 in

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:34.340
 three years the other race is going to be 2022k the date to leave the 60th down in the

00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:40.310
 stepping it is already possible to get out bread What is ours our project on the Mac first

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:44.240
 creation of the President Because literacy secretariat through the creation of

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:49.010
 of this secretariat we started to defend the use of scientific evidence

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:52.510
 in the design of educational policies

00:20:52.620 --> 00:21:01.710
 the player started in 98

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:08.880
 98 the first first name is the floor P was going to be speaking so President see in

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:13.580
 the latter steps fifty percent of young Brazilians between 15 and 16 years old

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:18.990
 stayed at level 1 or below the level where on a process scale that goes

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:24.679
 from one to six councilors to see oh it was down there down there So what happens

00:21:24.679 --> 00:21:29.100
 are 15 and 16 year olds and researches the scientific evidence

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:34.320
 show that children who do not complete the literacy process in years

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:39.480
 of elementary school, the probability is that 90 ninety-six

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:43.830
 five percent of these children continue to fail in the third and fourth years of

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:49.460
 Elementary School and 70 75 percent and have their school trajectory

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:52.630
 compromised then there is a correlation between the

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:56.830
 is well in learning to read and write in the early years and the

00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:00.970
 results on the step I give you an example in the last two editions of the evaluation

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:07.270
 National Literacy Program for Anna in 2014/2016 55 percent of our students

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:11.590
 at the end of the 3rd year of elementary school, they had insufficient knowledge in

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:15.160
 president reading which means they couldn't manage to be human they knew

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:19.900
 didn’t know how to read to reverse this situation, the bolsonaro government creates the

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:24.340
 literacy secretariat because we understand that the first children

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:28.870
 need to learn to read and then read to learn So we’re not

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:34.750
 managing to make our children read and understand texts and

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:40.450
 for those who not only for the exact beginning but only for the foundation President what

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:45.430
 what previous government previous governments did was build a house but

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:49.740
 build the roofs coming to university only a careful foundation

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:55.490
 then the house is not submissive to fix it and there will be a national program

00:22:55.490 --> 00:23:00.050
 of school feeding nation as the forecast of the week with 4 high batteries

00:23:00.050 --> 00:23:03.620
 regions with the program was born from food as a large 40 of the

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:07.430
 inch is home huh spending money and food is going where

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:12.260
 so this is where we did we had to deliver a large part was delivered in

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:17.540
 home my present another direct money at school That was the one Look at the

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:22.910
 present value here 600 million and millions will be your minutes which is

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:27.800
 we send the money to help the classes return we want the return

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:31.550
 of classes is penis another one defends from face-to-face class Of course he is defending And we

00:23:31.550 --> 00:23:36.470
 we want president that But it doesn’t depend on us is in the hands of as

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:41.230
 the STF decided in the hands of the mayor the governor

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:45.440
 supportive everyone care hurt the world we want Bento our did up to a

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:52.620
 10-year-old daughter studying here in Brasilia

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:59.460
 distance education the mother enforces there is no conversation enforces but great

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:04.380
 part of the kids, parents cannot charge their children, we are losing

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:13.559
 a lot in education Brazil loses and obviously the MEC gave a favorable opinion to the

00:24:13.559 --> 00:24:18.780
 back to school one meter mine seemed to look like mine from my team there are

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:24.720
 go back to classes protocols without taking care of us and we even wrote protocol of

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:30.450
 biosafety we listen to the doctors just to return carefully and we send this is

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:37.050
 important the mandamus for each school 120 thousand is practically 80 eighty thousand

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:44.150
 prorated a few more times because there are 117,000 public schools

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:50.700
 come on connected student program has stay must now the child can't go

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:56.910
 for school there I no one school is provided to us 400,000

00:24:56.910 --> 00:25:02.590
 chips so that those who were now studying Federal Institute and University

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:07.090
 could the staff have to do with what is the same thing is to Are connected to

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:12.790
 schools are also schools in whether they are connected. These are

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:19.120
 connected since account a case only that I was so discouraged one a director of

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:24.900
 more Cola from Rio Presidente He said that only seventy percent of the students

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:33.070
 could have a connection and that’s why he was going to close school and it was closed then as

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:39.070
 only seventy percent and not 100% is the same idea that a boat is sinking

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:45.670
 100 people have only 70 lifeguards he prefers to sink with everyone and doesn’t give

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:50.320
 the 70 lifesavers for those who could Socorro is crazy logic

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:55.850
 people go through a little chicken here get in some thinking games for publishing the

00:25:55.850 --> 00:26:00.560
 week that I was in the government, I was going to privatize the transposition of São

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:05.240
 Francisco has a flow agreement ten years ago it was signed I don't know if in

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:09.170
 Lula government Zinho government that transposing an old thing nobody

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:13.520
 never said it's mine is we are finishing the work was stopped on average

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:18.140
 10 years in want to privatize anything what an agreement was made that the states

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:24.170
 beneficiaries would pay the costs of generating the electricity used for the

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:29.960
 transposition and despite the agreement no state is paid anything to the government

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:34.700
 this is what is being discussed is the course of generation and in our part there is

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:38.240
 will charge I had there helps to remember what city I had there for the

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:45.320
 interior of Ceará and fruit fruit one told me not even about your city here

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:49.250
 appropriate to be charged Earth so be that person doesn’t even have it right and

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:52.620
 look at news days to put people count at the time of a hundred and

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:58.530
 and will live with a lie for a long time imagine, right in 2022, how does this

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:02.480
 fake news broadcast you ride potentiated and by a lot of people

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:08.400
 preaching what they preached during 2018 when I came candidate saying that the

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:15.240
 enemy of what I was going to do evil with that is what I was going to transform the

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:21.800
 country of male chauvinists homophobic xenophobic and among other things there

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:28.530

 government that we have already revoked was 3,397 each decree that we issued right

 we signed five we sailed I paid a mission to Minister Jorge who now

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:35.230
 is going to have your look at each decree that I am obliged to

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:40.120
 sign by law until you have to sauté two he delivered twice

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:46.540
 kind of the request for him and even more the total standards she revoked 12 years

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:52.510
 is surpassed the braised in 20 years of previous governments is not I compromise

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:58.060
 with the reduction of bureaucracy, excellent news is going well too

00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:06.040
 and we had a pandemic it started to interfere with the number of unemployed

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:13.000
 in Brazil, the invisible, right, the informal, I want about 38

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.620
 millions have completely lost their income their income very very much have generated

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:21.490
 that he couldn’t sell anything on the beach anymore because he was overwhelmed on the beach

 madness ok if the vitamin see i used to say ok i'm not a doctor i talked to

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:32.370
 doctor who is Vitamin Vitamin D helped to inhibit, you know, to prevent you

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:37.060

 government took several emergency aid measures the plant was created a

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:07.490
 support program for small and micro enterprises that was created by

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:11.570
 government but he sensitive of the law was Senator Jorginho Mello Santa Catarina I

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:16.010
 I think the most exceptional project we have is not seeing the federal government

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:21.620
 initiative was from the Cerrado in Senator Jorginho Mello who really held

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:26.090
 million jobs from Brazil Our angels exchange proposal right And we

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:31.490
 obviously we are taking a course on that so you’re not mistaken it’s not 32 billion

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:36.980
 real costs there for us all right So look in July we already had the

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:41.780
 such from CAGED that the General Register of Employed and Unemployed started

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:46.820
 negative March April went down there in the employees increased too much restraint

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:52.300
 with a formal contract but in July we had the first scene are positive

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.760
 August or September another now October we had

00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:00.410
 one to change from October voice that Brazil that

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:08.300
 eu 394 thousand jobs with a formal contract is largely due to the reduction of bureaucracy

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:12.890
 it’s also just used to criticize many previous governments and as I voted

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:17.960
 favorable because former President Michel Temer was far from reforming the

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:23.180
 CLT here very special the guy got it right there are those who got the right to

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:29.800
 no one but also in the painter the boss is still not in a cast

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:34.610
 I even talked to Paulo Guedes, he will not show up this year as you are

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:38.830
 difficult beginning next year we are going to create the program my first company

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:44.930
 that keeps complaining right when I knew it’s really low I recognize it’s low but no

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:49.390
 has a comment What is it, it reflects directly on the

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:53.200
 retirees and pensioners and we have a huge range of retirees and

00:32:53.200 --> 00:33:00.810
 pensioners, right, it reflects on the staff there at BPC, the benefit of continued provision

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:06.750
 reflected in the VTC also in its amount more are tens of billions of reais that

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:12.610
 if you spend with it and you don’t have to take money anymore, whoever complains will

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:17.470
 have a chance to set up your company the government will give a formula some help

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:21.070
 obviously the citizen can stop being employed let him stay there for him

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:26.110
 put the companies present from Alice I talk about this topic there about work

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:31.930
 the United States has neither a third nor a fifth of the rights I ask no

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:37.660
 want to go there, right, and the one of life, no one is seeing here, let's end up with

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:41.260
 it works feeding inside shown is showing a side is a

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:45.130
 example Brazilians when they are going to need it I don't want to come back here but it is

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:48.679
 something What and it’s not easy for you to move something

00:33:48.679 --> 00:33:52.100
 thing here don't accuse me wanted to end right from the goal I showed you just

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:57.590
 an example money continues to exist from the reform of the fear it was also proposed

00:33:57.590 --> 00:34:05.210
 2002 and then what is left did the internet was very little Few people

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:10.970
 internet here in times and mineiro still a lot of people used on the phone as

00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:15.950
 is that is the name internet on the phone there man because the internet disclosed that whoever

00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:21.440
 that faithful voted in the House ok ahead division I already worked this had returned

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:28.609
 to end the guarantee fund as it was this 13th lie pregnant license

00:34:28.609 --> 00:34:34.070
 because this right is guaranteed in article 7 of the condition and not by any other

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:37.310
 amendment proposal that I couldn't get out of there because that according to

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:44.000
 lawyers are stone clauses and that was done was not proposed in law so

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.940
 what did it say reads something i wanted for example have vacations for

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:53.030
 take away could you negotiate your vacation receive the two vacation launch

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:58.050
 anticipate Flames was called flexible no one will lose right and it's not a pity

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:02.190
 flexible and at that time and voted in favor picked up much of the

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:08.130
 Press is where the PT grew up made the biggest bench of Federal Deputies of the bed

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:13.800
 that I will lose that was against your proposal but in fact everything that is

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:19.260
 tie the most very rigid you end up having prejudice is like a marriage

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:24.420
 When someone else is jealous to the extreme naughty wedding, that's right, so how much

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:27.599
 that my wife is not my husband that he is doing what she is doing

00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:33.180
 doing comes home and starts ends up having a problem or in the labor collection

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:37.890
 it's the same thing the boss is a lot to see pay a little more but when he sees

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:43.080
 at the front, if it presents, it’s breaking, it’s not selling anything anymore and

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.970
 going to have to fire someone is so much right to pay that the

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:50.020
 and you have to sell his factory the house the parrot dog for him to pay

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:53.619
 money so that's why I had a big boarding

00:35:53.619 --> 00:35:58.060
 work so flexibilizing doesn’t mean ending up Wait a minute she was just

00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:01.750
 missing the globe will not say tomorrow here on my Live today right I said that

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:04.869
 I'm going to end up with a day's work, it's okay to keep this little piece because

00:36:04.869 --> 00:36:08.869
 get to go and show you that this is not what was treated here look

00:36:08.869 --> 00:36:14.869
 Amapá's energy at dawn yesterday was 100% reestablished the problem

00:36:14.869 --> 00:36:19.759
 began November 3rd if it weren't for the federal government forecasting

00:36:19.759 --> 00:36:24.619
 two-month vacation is back to normal, that is, only the third of January folks

00:36:24.619 --> 00:36:29.569
 Passadinha Christmas and New Year Amapá personal without electricity personally

 the bench of Amapá to meet the president of the senate to see how that

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:49.220
 also looked for and when it burst it just goes up the example of were not

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:52.670
 up that he right but we serve everybody information

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:58.910
 need passed to us by the by the president of the national congress on the day

00:37:03.289 --> 00:37:08.880
 over there in Macapá and started to address the issue who in the first place

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:16.049
 and to supply energy at the most sensitive points in the army and navy she you

00:37:16.049 --> 00:37:20.400
 it was not because there was just a lack of more business units in the region, I had to

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:25.529
 weight of the navy and army generators of ours immediately was us too

00:37:25.529 --> 00:37:31.920

 caught fire on the ready son and yours Besides I do demagogy here that

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:53.060
 flower story and another one just happens

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:58.799
 here, the distribution of energy is only privatized

00:38:58.799 --> 00:39:02.910
 inspection by the Ministry of Mines was lacking and the flea is already pulling the

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:10.380
 responsibility well for good news the day before yesterday wednesday at

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:16.990

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:22.810
 from Macapá that sells heavy rafts goes from Manaus and the stock exchange was turned on and

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:27.190
 restoring without percent of Amapá's energy Look what you need to do and the

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:33.100
 minister Bento is doing in addition to determining responsibility right we will see

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:38.580
 now that now competes ring with an agency to see here what possible sanctions

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:45.070
 possible possible charging guidelines can be made with the energy so that

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:52.810
 this doesn’t happen again last case here if Robson he’s stuck in

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:57.310
 Russia since the beginning of last year he came with the medicine there that we are

00:39:57.310 --> 00:40:02.380
 here there is no problem but for Russia and to be considered a drug Then he

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:07.590
 arrived to open his suitcase had the medicine ready the side went home there in Russia

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:12.869
 30 days later he was summoned and arrested for what came to my knowledge

00:40:12.869 --> 00:40:16.760
 I also talked that João or Fernando, who is now playing in China

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:23.030
 ok all the measures were taken everything was done to help but justice

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:28.850
 and the collection of drugs there in Russia is very serious is not common in Brazil not

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:34.840
 we had time is arrested with cocaine and the Liberdade post a Custody hearing

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:41.990
 he right and then the staff asks for an interference Our joined the president

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:49.610
 from Russia well what we know and is from previous home, right?

00:40:49.610 --> 00:40:55.310
 similar to him that the one on the street knows is he granted the pardon Or sent the person from

00:40:55.310 --> 00:41:01.700
 back to serve his sentence in his country the matter of a few weeks was there the

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:07.790
 our downloader for Russia delivered a letter Our was with the senator brings

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:13.160
 I am not mistaken there in Mato Grosso do Sul is your deal in the second with him was

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:17.480
 there we made contact there was no contact was made there with the equivalent of

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:23.750
 Minister Ernesto aee is in progress and now but the decision of the Russian government

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:29.230
 happens after the trial until the trial there is no possibility right

00:41:29.230 --> 00:41:35.660
 says how difficult it is to resolve the matter You are waiting for the outcome of this collection

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:40.430
 and if God wants we can bring the hobby back here it has nothing to do

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:46.020
 with another drug dealer who was arrested in the past and sentenced to death

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:51.270
 the country that other I exchange cocaine in hiding this one has nothing yet

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:55.470
 Robson doesn’t have any change, it was a remedy that for us here is

00:41:55.470 --> 00:42:00.480
 sold on prescription but out there to Russia and this is drug and it is not

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:05.280

 those children and faced difficulties in learning to read

00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:41.130
 but today all children can use it so the graphogame is for children between

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:45.369
 four and nine years old and those children who are in education

00:42:45.369 --> 00:42:48.940
 child preparing for formal literacy those in the

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:52.480

 AM the schools that sanitary in

00:48:53.890 --> 00:49:00.490
 did not understand what I am going to the measure taken by the Ministry of Education was the

00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:08.320
 of is by transferring resources the education networks we prepare

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:13.000
 the return to school we know what is the position of the minister's president with

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.860
 relation to this period that we are going through then the secretariat of

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:21.820
 literacy, right? I am manufacturing secretary, I can only talk about the

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:31.030
 secretary made a cut of 183 million there in the emergency pdde that was created

00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:38.260
 by the Ministry of Education to serve schools In this period of return to

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:40.710
 classes in preparation for return to school

00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:49.250
 we only want the good of the students the good of the Parents peace of mind for the parents

00:49:49.470 --> 00:49:54.990
 o and at first this a large amount parents who were

00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:59.910
 opposed to back in class this number was presented in reverse has

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:06.180
 diminished I don’t know nowadays but I think most are already in favor of

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:10.320
 the presence back one more part another considered is contrary has some

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:16.020
 entity the council someone is defending is isolation for students until the

00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:22.830
 end of next year has I i have been having some conversation already with our

00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:28.530
 National Council of Education that I point to the end I naturally respect

00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:37.740
 Open the end of the year 2021 lecture class but it is an indication that the class will be

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:42.930
 that we're still going to be on the effects of all that nobody knows the future the

00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:47.730
 that I'm going to talk to our national commission is to leave it the way

00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:52.810
 After all president I define nothing who defines if he returns to class

00:50:52.810 --> 00:50:58.150
 whether or not you are Mayor and Governor now if I have a decision from the MEC saying that

00:50:58.150 --> 00:51:04.089
 it's 2021 all unions all groups that are opposed to the return of

00:51:04.089 --> 00:51:10.450
 class they will say that it is a decision of the Federal Government look guys I want

00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:15.280
 try to explain here is a bill was passed this year that got to my

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:25.210
 table for sanction or veto again is about invitation and there the articles said

00:51:25.210 --> 00:51:32.530
 the following that the products to combat the invitation produced United States

00:51:32.530 --> 00:51:38.420
 Japan and the European Union and China if it arrived in Brazil

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:44.569
 Anvisa would have 72 hours to approve it will authorize the distribution and application

00:51:44.569 --> 00:51:52.760
 I vetoed this device PT the congress overturned the veto So look at that we have

00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:58.150
 then the sea I don’t say War anymore Not some

00:51:58.150 --> 00:52:03.430
 deadlocks over independent Anvisa vaccine does not help a governor

00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:07.330
 Zinho then we know he was going to be criticizing.

00:52:07.330 --> 00:52:14.610
 independent ok those who know the wires nowadays take your hat off after taking into account

00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:22.510
 some of the members that occupied the warning was a terrible thing ok

00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:27.100
 I want to accuse all integrated life but some were there for the interests

00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:32.200
 warning nowadays to be able to have a true lesson in patriotism of love for your neighbor

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:40.900
 of humanism regarding the virus making decisions and turning night made

00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:47.800
 a lot now it's just a law obliging Anvisa in 72 or in my place and

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:54.830
 distributing products that are certified in other countries there is not up to me ok

00:52:54.830 --> 00:53:02.200
 and I what to depend on me right and Molten to lose me make it very clear

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:06.710
 after any medicine you understand vaccine, right, so it’s not

00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:12.530
 medicine for a vaccine to prevent a disease go through education

00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:17.870
 for health and is certified by Anvisa the federal government will buy this

00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:24.220
 material and will make it available to the population free of charge and voluntarily

00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:31.010
 so there is a concern from everyone that other interests may be

00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:35.720
 involved in this collection of the vaccine is very much the interest of a governor there and

00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:41.240
 I wanted to save his life, he was very concerned that I even think that he

00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:44.420
 died today she goes to heaven who Santos is so worried about

00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:50.570
 save life, ok, it's a saint with tight pants, but it's ok, the thing is

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:54.840
 serious about it in terms of responsibility there and

00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:59.730
 what I'm going to fight I'm going to do I'm going to do that I think With all due respect to

00:53:59.730 --> 00:54:05.280
 Parliament that I went to regret is also the overthrow of this veto of mine is

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:10.770
 it didn't go well seeing we don't want to delay anything so much it's here once

00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:15.270
 Anvisa certified any medicine any vaccine from our

00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:21.870
 immediately part of ours we will arrange the purchase and the program

00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:25.710
 no National Plan for Immunization of the patient ready there, health for us

00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:30.000
 pass the one that I'm not going to ask here for Milton or for anything right

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:35.610
 did we get the vaccine or not ok i tell you i will not take it is a

00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:42.600
 mine right and i'm sure parliament will not create difficulty

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:46.230
 for those who do not want to get a vaccine because those who do not get a vaccine

00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:51.330
 it is effective if it is long-lasting if it is reliable you know that not taking it is doing it

00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:56.570
 harm to yourself and whoever gets vaccinated and will not be infected So you have to

00:54:56.570 --> 00:55:00.320
 worry about 200 guys who want to work with me did not take me too i'm clear

00:55:53.359 --> 00:55:59.180
 what the country that is making this vaccine available to us pays

00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:04.759

 Augusto Nunes a Hi guys good night Minister Milton

00:58:42.970 --> 00:58:45.300
 Ribeiro

00:58:45.609 --> 00:58:52.989
 the Ministry of Education can do to end the most extensive quarantine

 world school that is existing in Brazil yet of course I can only

00:59:04.509 --> 00:59:08.859
 express what i can do express my will that the lessons returns

00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:18.339
 according to the law does not allow Minister Milton to arrive at the

00:59:18.339 --> 00:59:21.930
 Ministry talked to me a lot that he was concerned about the effects

00:59:21.930 --> 00:59:26.319
 negative effects of the period of social isolation and removal of children from

00:59:26.319 --> 00:59:32.019

 impacts of removing children from schools and we have these political issues

01:01:58.660 --> 01:02:03.519
 right, they are involved but we in the secretariats are doing the most

01:02:03.519 --> 01:02:09.519
 to minimize what's going on with our children and new all of us

01:02:09.519 --> 01:02:14.589
 we owe our training to teachers i was forever grateful to my

01:02:14.589 --> 01:02:20.529
 teachers I had I remember some names remember I studied in 1964 at

01:02:20.529 --> 01:02:24.910
 school group Coronel Siqueira de Moraes in Jundiaí I remember going there to

01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:31.269
 person you you are she her name saw you you and i remember my side sat student

01:02:31.269 --> 01:02:35.019
 Rosana when I put you sitting next to the girl you were embarrassed

01:02:35.019 --> 01:02:41.109
 a punishment without suffering and we are there I learned something, right, that is missing

01:02:41.109 --> 01:02:45.619
 something for us to improve education i'm all We remind the

01:02:45.619 --> 01:02:51.829
 we are grace they are wonderful memories of them ok and we owe each

01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:57.950
 increasingly value the teacher giving back to him that a part was taken

01:02:57.950 --> 01:03:03.109
 right the classroom authority in the middle sorry here you will not do that

01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:06.890
 go for me some I'm in the classroom the teacher entered does not have to get up

01:03:06.890 --> 01:03:12.829
 have to call the teacher the Lord teacher the lady doesn't have to be

01:03:12.829 --> 01:03:17.390
 treatment that way But unfortunately that was little by little

01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:21.140
 being relaxed relaxed and the consequences also as we said in the

01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:25.249
 start of the Pisa test program ours down there and this is bad for the

01:03:25.249 --> 01:03:30.999
 But we cannot import services import professionals that we do not train

01:03:30.999 --> 01:03:35.299
 certain type of process type of professions in Brazil here contains it

01:03:35.299 --> 01:03:42.230
 This is a change that takes time and we’re doing our best to

01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:48.210
 achieve this goal aa collection of 2 I do not yet exist in Brazil have to

01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:35.440
 entering the five ways, it's Artificial Intelligence academy more

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:40.370
 computerized or so look at the two months ago I joined a

01:08:40.370 --> 01:08:46.370
 corn harvester are turning on video you press a button at

01:08:46.370 --> 01:08:50.420
 GPS goes away now you have to know what that thing is there, the driver or not

01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:55.940
 you have to have it, you have to have a knowledge to operate that you have

01:08:55.940 --> 01:09:00.430
 knowledge of the soap opera I asked a question health is

01:09:01.569 --> 01:09:03.630
 What's up

01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:10.220
 Good evening Minister Milton Ribeiro Pires start of the administration of the President Bolsonaro

01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:15.620
 there was a proposal to transfer to the Ministry of Science, Technology and

01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:20.390
 higher education you very good acceptance here in the educational area because it would leave

01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:26.330
 the federal government ministry of education centered on elementary education there is the

01:09:26.330 --> 01:09:31.850
 possibility of making this change I wanted that if I also talked about the

01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:39.380
 payroll weight of the Ministry of Education looks at swimming looks at what what

01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:47.060
 the following happens I the pandemic the covid-19 disease she just

01:09:47.060 --> 01:09:53.359
 paralyzed some administrative actions and this matter I came up with four

01:09:53.359 --> 01:10:00.230
 months, I did not have the opportunity to talk in depth with Minister Marcos Pontes Mas

01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:05.040
 I believe that in the future we can even study this but for now we

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:10.800
 there is nothing defined about this topic of the possible transfer of School

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:15.720
 Superior that is a very very big man complex confection company

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:20.310
 even look who it was was the thread here said that ok Question here I go

01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:28.719
 use but Maria to Maria a and the Green Party filed a lawsuit in the

01:10:28.719 --> 01:10:34.320
 Supreme know how browsing and asking that in the case the sad list that

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:37.530
 comes to my knowledge get to my desk I be thank you choose the

01:10:37.530 --> 01:10:40.740
 first on the list

01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:47.910
 and look, this is really going, I don't know which one

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:51.690
 will be Supreme attention but if it is to choose the first one on the list because it has

01:10:51.690 --> 01:10:56.250
 that arrive at my desk to sign that the act of possession of that one

01:10:56.250 --> 01:11:01.350
 new rector that I decide to skip has university autonomy are close to

01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:05.610
 University sovereignty nobody wants I don't want to interfere politically place

01:11:05.610 --> 01:11:11.460
 none but what is common to get to my desk is Philips then Diego research

01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:15.450
 research a person's life people bring information that it reaches our

01:11:15.450 --> 01:11:21.570
 front comes from there comes information to this guy this is from PSOL this other from PT

01:11:21.570 --> 01:11:25.860
 this other fabric, we should not choose anyone for the

01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:33.050
 ideological issue but we see that they are militants and which one you choose

01:11:33.050 --> 01:11:37.380
 In this regard, you have to use this non-most suitable criterion to exclude yourself

01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:43.650
 Not someone on your list but is committed and committed now is Here

01:11:43.650 --> 01:11:48.450
 we also became aware that That University is ranked the Ace

01:11:48.450 --> 01:11:52.410
 the reappointment for being there last put that guy shouldn't be

01:11:52.410 --> 01:11:58.860
 reappointed I can choose the third insurance from the list the first one that comes

01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:04.320
 for reappointment until the intention of place and then the Green Party in the PV to withdraw

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:10.050
 money our Supreme will decide was deciding being decided on a

01:12:10.050 --> 01:12:16.230
 I was missing the virtual session, the report was the beginning for those who

01:12:16.230 --> 01:12:23.220
 Paraná ok And then Someone asked for Vista there and it will be in person Okay it will be

01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:26.380
 then go back and discuss it again so what

01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:32.590
 I more and more have no power to decide I think there was a

01:12:32.590 --> 01:12:36.940
 election EA law says they are the top three for the Republic price

01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:40.389
 decide which problem because at the moment the PT doesn’t become trying to change

01:12:40.389 --> 01:12:44.660
 that's because just because the store issue spoke louder

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:50.860
 no one is in the PT to meddle in anything and President Dilma Lula chooses

01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:54.880
 whoever wants to be on the list with the most votes or no one ever had when

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:59.800
 it came to me has to change with me now now what we want from

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:04.650
 University change if someone As said here being reappointed

01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:08.580
 regardless of his PT membership thinking to see the people who are very common

01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:16.060
 and if Olivia is already back there, that person from mine is not well ranked

01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:22.420
 understand i'm going to make time for space one of the other two this is how unfortunately

01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:26.290
 education in my Got it was set up in Brazil we want to change

01:13:26.290 --> 01:13:30.610
 I don't want to put a guy from the right there to the extreme right with this one

01:13:30.610 --> 01:13:33.670
 accuse I want to put a different one from the one that is not working I was

01:13:33.670 --> 01:13:38.950
 giving sky to end is dangerous I ended President a lot of people

01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:44.140
 asking here what a teddy bear is, having Cyril is the mascot of the show

01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:48.450
 for me at the Ministry of Education a program that highlights the role of the family

01:13:48.450 --> 01:13:52.960
 in the Children's literacy process of course we are not

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:56.920
 encouraging families to literate early weight at home but the

01:13:56.920 --> 01:14:01.750
 contribute to promoting through simple development activities by

01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:04.720
 example of the language of the little ones are on the website of the education ministry

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:10.270

 I remember the family Remember for God's sake the books of a few years ago validate the

01:14:34.389 --> 01:14:39.790
 PT government the prince fell in love with the princess daughter for the love of god ended

01:14:39.790 --> 01:14:46.239
 that nobody that is what your child learns this classroom nobody wants

01:14:46.239 --> 01:14:52.480
 that the child in the classroom, you know, teach him that it doesn’t matter that he is

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:56.889
 going to say the 12th century three years old this leads nowhere led

01:14:56.889 --> 01:15:01.570

01:15:22.510 --> 01:15:26.300

 research that never research item and whoever goes to the second round good luck a

01:15:40.730 --> 01:15:45.560
 good decision and thus take into account the party to which that candidate in the second

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:51.410
 shift belongs to what What party defends has always defended the ideology of

01:15:51.410 --> 01:15:58.160
 gender right wear our family members ignoring education a lot of things

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:03.680

01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:24.290
 matter it will be taught in the classroom what it will defend what many

01:16:24.290 --> 01:16:28.860
 times this candidate favored him and promised a party related to him
