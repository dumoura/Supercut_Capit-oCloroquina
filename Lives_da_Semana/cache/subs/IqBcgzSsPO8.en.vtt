 in a natural relationship there, we talk to Luís do Maranhao to do the

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:19.359
 president knows we had transfusion are already using car swap for another

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:25.730
 product and we did accompanies possible

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.310
 thank you i am always here everything goes well

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.750
 what's up

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.580
 what's up

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.370
 if you're worried a little bit the truth my pen and you believe in

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.280
 datafolha I only the following operating republic and its ministers are

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:04.210
 working the week to minimize the effects of the stopwatch on the lives of

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:12.790
 people are in first place now a detail the dose of the medicine cannot be

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:20.340
 excessive so that the side effect is more damaging than Jesus himself is

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.359
 and this is the heart of the matter the press is important to spread the truth

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:31.469
 but it is not with a question like this did France, the lady here beside me is a

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:36.360
 question in patriotic a question that goes against the interest of brazil

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.939
 a question that leads or describes the Brazilian company a question me

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.159
 sorry infamous to you that I'm accusing the press and being beaten standing up

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.849
 you believe get out of the dawn front now that we want the solution to the case

00:01:52.849 --> 00:02:01.580
 we cannot avoid it and the effects of the coronavirus do not have

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:08.360
 vaccine and as yet there is no treatment we can not take the

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.240
 panic for society that panic is a disease too

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:22.150
 it is more serious than the cause of the virus glasses itself

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.620
 feeling but we have to take the job population are being

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:34.930
 exterminated especially those who live in informality these people do not

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:42.569
 can survive more than three or four days without their livelihood from informality

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:51.430
 and the person with panic, she goes into depression, she becomes more susceptible

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:58.269
 to pass the virus against me and has a tragic end to your life so

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:04.389
 as we have no way of avoiding the virus we are just trying to lengthen the curve

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:10.299
 contamination, we are making it possible, it is not possible to go beyond what

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.909
 we're doing all the ministries has been working ceaselessly is none

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:21.459
 question that the popularity of a certain better than mine does broad beans put will be

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.579
 who no longer has the smartest Brazilian company to make a

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:31.989
 question height of brazil height of lives that are at risk of this virus

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.570
 now send me a question here look

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:49.950
 a still more uses clt a way to preserve maize jobs and the date of

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.590
 life the notice period allowed if you go on vacation now that is better than

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.200
 that being fired basically is that our measures are there other measures are

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.900

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.420
 low the same thing you give a certain savings box during the week now

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.550
 news here that are welcome right obviously by the situation that Brazil is

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:00.750
 meets the health ministry's own tip working 24 hours a day

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.060
 looking for solutions for that all work all the work without exception

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.520
 I also here almost 24 hours a day are 22 ministries that I have for

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.620
 front where the ones on my face are there but as far as the ministry of

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.540
 quality competent people selfless people are delivering

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.810
 completely looking for a solution to this problem

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:34.460
 a little bit I will be without signal

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:41.039
 and then automatic unemployment comes here

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:45.449
 I have to go, right, no one is fired, no one. What I complain about is that

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:50.880
 there are some authorities who are administering the medicine and it is certain that it takes

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:56.849
 unemployment today I have video conference two a governor thing on

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:00.620
 northeast after north where we will hear them

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.770
 and logically take suggestions from him and what the government can do for

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:13.160
 people's lives and maintaining their jobs will continue to do there

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.240
 i already know i'm going to start with paulo guedes and collection stirring morals about the

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.930
 suspension of payment for the six months of são paulo this has already been done by discussing

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:30.430
 this proposal of this is in the federative pact and it was there that payment of the

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.630
 how much wood can but have to listen to paulo guedes is he who will say

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:39.730
 at the door of the line, right, how much does it cost I don't know millions maybe maybe 18

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:43.930
 millions if I'm not mistaken here pluscare this measure to extend

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.350
 for the other states and we have to tell me also i'm not sure são paulo

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:51.900
 state that more then I believe to bring others right

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.639
 my mother importance that is equivalent to attending in são paulo almost

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:02.099
 are suffering right and I do not enter this field do not enter

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:07.409
 right lady is a defended don't know why it was asked the question for him that

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:12.210
 you did it for me you could say yes or no but it is still very far away I believe in

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:18.210
 four weeks is Brazil here has already started to have a new horizon for

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:25.349
 this collection of laughter I think the vice will be with me too now if I don't

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:30.210
 I'm mistaken to schedule an audience with me talk to me every moment and I feel better

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:41.810
 than here

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:49.000
 and I don't think people know at 14 or 15 hours the first soft mole of

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.610
 my part can transmit I'm sure it will be human but video that

00:07:54.610 --> 00:08:00.159
 it was very high level looking for solutions to the problem ok look guys

00:08:00.159 --> 00:08:06.400
 serious was and is not today has these two big

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.610
 regions is tomorrow ti tomorrow tomorrow long here the other governors

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:17.460
 until the next one to call you and then

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:22.530
 the northeast store, which is very governing, you know, they want to take the time

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:30.810
 right it gets better that concentrates more and better phrase that you can give

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:38.360
 an answer for him is not 19 in the northeast i7 of the north is a lot of people right

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.659
 so it is better to make a separate understanding and tomorrow do one or two more

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:49.830
 from the south-west south-west center I did it at 0 and do a press conference after three depends

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:53.970
 the moment depends on the weather right depends on what's happening you can’t score

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:59.000
 here but thank you the wonderful person you are
