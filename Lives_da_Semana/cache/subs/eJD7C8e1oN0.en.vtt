00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:48.910
 I said too much excuse there, pedro guimarães near the box said no

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:54.460
 sponsored no soccer team nor I have inter gave my palms and neither the

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.520
 botafogo of rio de janeiro that is bursting in the cup of brazil passed

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.810
 for penalties of the game very difficult any English team and shaking which team that

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:06.930
 it was the lamb the nautical hit hit the plague goats

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:11.040
 there from pernambuco there is a goat from the plague here not that the cearense cearense

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:16.210
 just did take it out and just have that nonsense here hahaha

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.509
 the big black head like that, right, because I’m not going to joke here

00:08:19.509 --> 00:08:24.120
 that we are going to eat in the critics okay, let's make a joke here not then

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:29.770
 I'm sorry, guys from the nautical team, the lamb boot here works

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:36.219
 with me catching defeated the nautical on his feet a very difficult game and won another

00:08:36.219 --> 00:08:41.909
 million in na likes us botafogo that same so she only liane cantanhede

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:47.830
 saying that the sound of those responsible for the shot there in that citizen who was in the

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:53.140
 backhoe the end of the trail so that's just what the price of the box said

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:58.209
 the box did not finance a football club in the past and I didn’t see it in this press

00:08:58.209 --> 00:09:04.810
 so it’s justifiable to see why the company attacks so many people

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.470
 doing for the good of brazil nobody is chasing the press there was an announcement

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:13.240
 football team didn’t spend on average as always spending 1 billion a year is

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.220
 advertising but I give something that matters

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:21.530
 we spent a year with a year and two months practically zero in the song a

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:25.790
 corruption I say there can be no can people do not know your monster ministry

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:29.930

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:34.520

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:41.930
 public thing looking to do the best is for Brazil looking for our policy ok

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.350
 sure it’s not just mine it’s your sum of ministers has one of mine

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:49.790
 side here is a secretary of fisheries in the front we want to do the best mine

 in this situation and it’s not the president who sends me there, I’m

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:04.090
 sending pressure here and we have to be responsible and the

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:11.410
 people who were doing committing criminal offenses in those regions where for

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:15.100
 a reason any reason just is going to your amazon have to understand that it is

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:20.020

 obviously its in ports and ships with bigger drafts end up attacking mom ok

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:18.430
 but quickly it’s worth it to hear you don’t like fish there who

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:24.130
 you know one day you are interested I can even make a deal because fishing in the

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:28.450
 Brazil is still close to other countries that I was astounded it seems

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:32.020

 it already has rivers with lakes with lagoons and streams with everything here and the piece is

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:05.510
 remember that that is this are normative number 10 capital since 2011 in the past

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:10.519

 that is to say clearly a money factory without even the proof and who

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:28.870
 pays this bill are the people who make the events artists

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:33.880

 way of doing it right and mentally interested there are people who are

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:46.750
 is that there are people who benefited from it and that same thing fell the year

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:51.100

 both stones and average 120 days right 120 days that has 120 days last year

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:01.700

 and I can't have this binge in some cases the Bolsa Família is a project to

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:32.010
 poor people who need it will not end the left she said I was going

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:37.950
 finished is not over yet had the 13th ok this year let's get it right talking about this

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:42.720
 of the pocket in the front instead because the law was mp that was valid only for the last year already

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:45.840
 they are saying that I don't want to give whoever said that they don't want to use whoever is also

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:49.410
 giving it is me, you know, the taxpayer that pays tax, we are going to do the same thing

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:53.820
 now we want to grant so you really need not bought with the

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:59.970
 business is a binge it was a little bit of respect here the interest was born

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:05.920
 political party this project and I remember the 2014 campaign dilma

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:11.320
 rousseff hit the face spoke 50 million people at Bolsa Família is no reason

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:15.880
 I was proud to have 50 maintenance of the family grant that you intend

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:21.400
 give a good education of the means to reduce bureaucracy so that you can

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:27.220
 I only defend workers, right? The employer, nobody says anything.

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:31.780
 is making life the employer that being a boss in Brazil is not easy

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:35.089
 vinasse has only complicated views

00:39:35.089 --> 00:39:41.359
 and let's go ahead I think it's ending, right, because the box is already made

00:39:41.359 --> 00:39:45.589
 economic the fortress score near petrobras has

00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:51.319
 monster profit is ending here now there is a panel at the bottom there that is just me

00:39:51.319 --> 00:39:57.289
 there was no time here 40 - it fell a little, it's 15,500, I was 23

00:39:57.289 --> 00:40:01.590
 thousand fell hello alright come on play ahead until

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:06.810
 work has crazy monster that is very clear to you the average nowadays

00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:13.020
 diesel at refineries r $ 2 a cent average in desu so this is the price of

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:17.880
 tithe that comes out of the petrobrás refinery delivers there i don't interfere in petrobras

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:21.300
 I can dismiss the price of petrobras I will not send it to the white castle

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:24.780
 it’s quiet white castle but I can’t I don’t pointer done on that

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:32.660
 talk to work there and have to play your part and not live off the

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:39.410
 way the neighbor in the past right then r $ 2 a lot of diesel and one and 77 a liter

00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:44.870
 of gasoline you claim there is $ 5 look there is federal tax has been

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:50.090
 ex-wife and the state state tax is also right and there must be a

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:55.490
 tax reform that is not easy i stayed 28 years in the chamber the only one stayed

00:40:55.490 --> 00:41:02.900
 against 24 good right 24 and you know that the tax reform never worked out that I

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:08.900
 I miss Paulo want to treat, right? I guess the suggestion for rent is

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:15.860
 one is a right of mine ok and he sees if it meets or not the federal taxes that

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:18.740
 starts with the one that messes with the state and municipal deposits will not

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:23.260
 give time like it never worked until today so let's do our part let's

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:29.300
 reduce bureaucracy give a tidy ah ok bye one thing more fight less

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:34.280
 in the end, the tax burden is not even greater than 0.001%

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:38.630
 but it has to be smaller it can't be bigger and it can attract the price with you so

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:45.770
 gasoline in 77 there at the diesel 2.0 refinery and profit is the name of petrobras

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:51.109
 why because the price of petrobras i understood that paulo guedes buys it

00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:54.590
 at petrobras and the company she works with her board did not have in the past

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:59.420
 right but board such a party you know what happened I couldn't give

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:04.720
 crazy even I took no profit at the time of reais was not that little bell

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:10.960
 here it is and you say lucas was an abuse it is very crazy to lower the price

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:15.220
 at the refinery if it decreases at the refinery it will not increase at the end of the pump

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:22.080
 because the average of the icms the icms the effect of the average of the final price there at the pump

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:28.370
 it is but governments have already done some send a letter criticizing hell

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:34.590
 but okay it's not true it's a thing the high throat says the talc too and has

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:37.260
 wrong thing and you have to resolve this matter there because nobody can take it anymore

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:40.770
 pay for this fuel, and there’s a federal tax so there’s no doubt

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:47.330
 state also another thing the savings bank also of the hops and always jan

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:51.560
 and even the only one here looks at your past as it was an indication of the price of

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:57.820
 police box police boards for each match of magic would have

00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:03.650
 vice presidency each match you will come if presence couldn't work no

00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:11.630
 it can work so there today I had to place this launch there

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:17.300
 real estate credit without a fee

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:23.140
 function of the economic box like what I turn the box is being valued

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:28.240
 cashiers know who their directors are they are president service

00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:32.570
 you know that there are no arrogant people now that we can't, we don't pass the ball

00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:36.990
 to anyone who had the rear of the pistol so that's it

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:42.450
 and it’s over now it’s not easy it’s my life it’s not easy it’s just knocking time

00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:46.870
 all is fake news talk here lie [ __ ]

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:50.290
