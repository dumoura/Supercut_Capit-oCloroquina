00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.689
 of the year in the two years that I think we failed twice It's just migrating

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.480

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.660
 and 22 continue in this Beat here always bringing people so they can

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.210
 mine clarify what happens when Federal since we can't

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.870
 find Claro Claro part of the mainstream media Our left one Elisângela

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.670
 Our interpreter pounds right here the Brazilian general our minister of

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.350
 health until you were greeted by the way that you have been performing your

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.680
 work really is not easy give what you download for sure the same

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.930
 thing that bothers me is the misinformation preached by this difference games here

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.580
 for example curiosity just here goes as a

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.600
 every day on the street I will change just in case there are dozens here so Jornal

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.500
 State of São Paulo on the 2nd of January here is a huge photo Praia

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.770
 Great you are seeing here thousands of people on the beach

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.979
 and here the state of São Paulo says that there is a cause of agglomeration come to see

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.170
 here at the beach and at the Sem Sem dei you were special, right?

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.250
 for those who can't, I realized that I don't have to wash with Márcia but I don't

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.979
 this mass that was used there the diving mask will make you nervous but

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.810
 This is very sad information. For example, it was talked about a lot this week that

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.630
 for incompetence of health and obviously the federal government you are also us

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.500
 we didn't do it due to the provision and syringes explains for us to do well the

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.810
 our good night everyone thanks for the opportunity we’re here to

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.549
 looking like things and talking and showing our way of being is like

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:24.980
 we are real and not as they sometimes paint us around or in the drawings around

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:32.780
 We are not normal human beings we have ours is say weaknesses and

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.200
 of our transportation but we are focused on the work touched on

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.420
 solution if the First idea to put it to you because we really

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:52.370
 often clashes with disinformation it clashes with how things are distorted and

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.329
 lead to complete public misinformation and when we talk about it we talk

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:05.370
 of a pandemic a distortion a misinformation

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.340
 and whether or not it is intended to cause drastic consequences of

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:19.560
 population causes united cause loofah causes a The uncertainty of what is happening in the

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.420
 day by day the same thing i will talk about a little bit about syringe

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.510
 and Brazil has the biggest immunization plan in the world we have one

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:38.069
 we have a one we falter a lot the people are used to looking for the

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.830
 vaccine we all vacillate we distribute around 300 million doses of

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:54.030
 vaccine year this is the reality So there is already a network of points of

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:00.209
 vaccination the municipalities waves followed its all municipalities and states already

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:06.030
 working today we have around 60 million in a row

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.130
 available in the states and municipalities today our account of the Ministry of

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:17.340
 Health is called the regulatory stock it was not to start the campaign it is so that

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.250
 we are in a position to help the municipality the state if he misses if he

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.060
 don't be able to buy hello so how do you see the process

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.450
 bidding back 90 days ago is the broad office process a first

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:40.740
 and normal second stage with bids from companies competing when you don't

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:48.980
 there are stretches of volunteers For an item in a process the name is deserted the one that has

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.500
 or when the bidding process does not reach the price that can be paid

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.850
 that item is called a failure And then you go to Disk for me to bid

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.970
 failed is that item that by law is said to have failed when it has no capacity

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:12.450
 of reaching the price the process continues he’s alive we already have new

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:18.480
 discussions with companies we temporarily suspended exports from

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.880
 export authorization we reduced import taxes

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:30.580
 The shepherds we are the starch action and in agreement with the the

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.800
 companies we made an administrative requisition has already requested 38

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.890
 million just don't go now to january february for the regulator stock so

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.780
 there is no chance of missing syringes because it is a simple thing

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:53.320
 and Brazil produces a lot of cylinders a lot of people hit and you hit me with this

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.540
 lie preached by the mainstream media that we did not have the competence to

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:04.090
 anticipate for Celina's purchase now seriously enjoy it understood if I understood

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.020
 here also the first moment you were going to buy because side but the price was there

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.010
 up is perfect so we had bought let's calculate here comes from paying

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:17.590
 x pay 2x and the accuse us the next day and super tool that we

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.190
 last received bribe brought him here this is how it works as soon as possible

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.680
 inhabitants There is no escape when talking about this

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.310
 this is the one that has no commitment to the truth and to life

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:34.460
 of the human being and when you preach lies unfold and invent lives

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:41.930
 they die when you take the terror with respect to the invite that takes from it Panic

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:47.810
 the population closes trade we take measures to lock down it is very takes the

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.550
 unemployment in an unemployed person she was driven to death by other causes

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:59.539
 also like suicide depression the person who does not work the tendency is if

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:04.220
 worse food will be prone to other diseases she does not leave home with

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.690
 afraid of everything that if i leave you and you that i'm going to die So this job

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:14.240
 pig from much of the media is included the globe also these newspapers a

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.289
 press here for the love of god a shame a national shame the

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:24.689
 Shame Wow I'm not even going to talk about one billion seven hundred million

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:29.489
 the keeper key turan favor of the family Maria who said or that feature

00:07:29.489 --> 00:07:33.299
 monstrous we go from all this time so this work when the media does a

00:07:33.299 --> 00:07:37.529
 job well done we're gonna get pyrolusite is a job further ahead and

00:07:37.529 --> 00:07:42.299
 is different when you say that you criticize Dr compassionate table of error now

00:07:42.299 --> 00:07:49.019
 we want to access we want to do the right thing now we have completed 2

00:07:49.019 --> 00:07:55.289
 years without anything about corruption corruption kills too and when it arrives it doesn't

00:07:55.289 --> 00:07:59.969
 the material arrives at the end of the line there are people who die because of it so

00:07:59.969 --> 00:08:03.899
 work our government is done with seriousness why we get

00:08:03.899 --> 00:08:09.530
 It is not easy to do the right thing Or even before our state-owned companies gave

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:14.530
 losses to state companies caused losses of tens of billions of doses per year

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:20.270
 with us went on to give billions of reais drawing example profits I'm sorry

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:25.190
 real is this big government mark among others can hear there is a

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:29.780
 corruption in ministry x can and if you have to do make resolve

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:35.150
 arepender you don’t need it he’s going to put it on top of the cars, right they go to

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:41.330
 we prosecute Although we have the right thing to do, it is to exonerate and prosecute this good

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:46.070
 that has control subtitle control is not that Captain Wagner is there

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:50.930
 he does preventive work also when he paints a name that the person was

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:55.990
 nominated and the imminence of occupying the government is

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:03.280
 so not a yellow blouse there not only there but people there in ours at Casa

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.730
 Civil and we took that person I will not give that person there already knew that

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:10.570
 it’s going to be a problem we don’t want it that it happened the problem for him

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:14.740
 take action This is the mark of our died and also enjoy it here

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:18.430
 present to you there I will not wait to finish here you have to talk

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:23.710
 for you to ask the questions of the drip staff here, this can prepare the

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:27.850
 first question so there are two quick issues here for us to come back and

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:32.470
 focus on the towel run of the house why you were asked to

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:38.410
 be here printed vote I didn't invent this now we have proof that since 2015 right

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:47.170
 we worked on this issue and look and November 18th 2015 was taken in

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:52.520
 vote a veto to the arm votes and the congress overthrew the veto

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:58.960
 the deputy and 56 senators voted to overturn the veto and became effective then

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:04.940
 this was in 2015 the government she Dilma Dilma Rousseff and the vote again and

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:10.520
 pay that it would be put into practice in 2018 This ended up not happening because

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:18.640
 our Supreme Court decided to say that it didn't work

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:23.080
 ah ah it's interference is a difference and why can't i speak

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:29.230
 because what sign right now which country in the world adopts the vote the electronic vote

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:34.840
 Like ours doesn’t have to be doesn’t have Venezuela doesn’t have the other country

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:39.460
 lost Germany has not accepted this one since it does not accept and the problems that

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:42.520
 as it happened in the United States with the origin of the problem I will not enter the

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:46.630
 doctor had other bad things the problem is transparent mistrust

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:52.300
 transparency and there could be an audit there to a large extent and even

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:57.370
 so we decided to do it and in the novel then go this collection as it is a few days is

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:01.360
 his problem is not their problem right not because nothing far before the

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:06.220
 problem with that but hey we can't allow that in 22 we have an election

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:12.190
 here today I cannot be agitated So who believes that electronic voting is worth

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:16.300
 okay don't do what i had with you now there are a lot of people who don't believe

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:21.230
 who wants to respect this side of me in something for us has a vote

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:26.240
 printed next to the one next to the electronic ballot box or whatever it is you're going to vote

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:32.660
 so you always came back but it will appear printed on the side the people who

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:38.329
 you went back to President Governor Senator federal and state deputy and

00:11:38.329 --> 00:11:46.309
 press the button your grandma is confirmed and the paper falls into an honor man

00:11:46.309 --> 00:11:51.889
 distrust can then be audited these sessions by Brazil what the

00:11:51.889 --> 00:11:56.569
 problem in this are eating already they got the diaper set for 22 i can only

00:11:56.569 --> 00:12:00.439
 understand this there I will not wait to arrive 22 da do not even know if I will come

00:12:00.439 --> 00:12:05.509
 candidate to start complaining we have to approve printed vote who's going

00:12:05.509 --> 00:12:09.920
 decide is the National Congress has a proposal in mine for the construction of the road

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:16.550
 Kies here in DF, it’s been a race, your consonance is over there, a commission of

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:21.360
 grant justice the future president of e da cama se resolve means eye

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:26.850
 it's installed in a create a commission to analyze it will be the will

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:31.829
 if it is voted and approved in bed I don’t know it will be promulgated in being provoked

00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:38.850
 this technique will be fulfilled e. and that faith that we will have will be fulfilled

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:43.170
 very close to the full movie think that you should not have the right vote to see if

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:48.330
 electronic back even see what animal will give in 2022 But we have to see the

00:12:48.330 --> 00:12:52.950
 examples of countries that are good or not because I'm here or not adopting here

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:58.040
 the last collection here I play very fast

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:02.720
 when some call me a genocide and you post it

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:09.340
 we are really great killers, right? innocent to say what we did pack

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:14.630
 mods was published by Brazil when the biggest relief program for the population

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:19.640
 was from our ball in no other country in the world arrived did it close to what we

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:27.560
 we only did emergency assistance were at the time of 292 billion reais the lowest

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:33.890
 state of Brazil Roraima received one billion reais and that is worth the

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:39.290
 their crime the owner of the Roraima type was an emergency aid so this

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:44.180
 messed with the economy the people made purchases got fed increased had

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:48.470
 inflation of something with the engine rice increased a little rice only in its

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:54.890
 meat looks just like that but only worse than the feeling in the basket

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:59.370
 basi and shortages if the country man

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:04.620
 that so many people criticize Agribusiness our homie from the countryside, right?

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:09.170
 that sucks if they hadn’t work there wouldn’t be food on your table

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:16.020
 so emergency aid that is a reality is a program just right I

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.080
 I want to see next week I bring Pedro's song here from Caixa

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:22.980
 Econômica Federal she talks about the other programs that we did that I'm just going to

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:28.830
 life-saving jobs did what the company did not shut down did what head of

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:34.490
 family don't despair son that we have to face a closure

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:39.990
 indiscriminate nature of the Brazilian economy if I had the power to deal with it

00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:44.520
 of this matter we will give special attention you are just a laughing group

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:50.880
 with community and older people and the rest the population returns to

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:57.360
 work would keep working And now what now some are doing the

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:02.310
 seeing all this is an irresponsibility so yes let your

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:08.520
 curiosity only is the state that received the most was not from the Northeast region are

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:22.350
 Nordeste Vingança 19 states our relative income was also more than the

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:28.709
 double the ratio of the type, that is, the one who received the most is the one who had less then

00:15:28.709 --> 00:15:35.399
 when we speak twice it’s a little thing it was 13 because her hair speaks speech

00:15:35.399 --> 00:15:41.240
 quickly here by the is just an important point a third of

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:48.500
 emergency aid for example from the Northeast and they represent around

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:53.810
 fifteen percent of GDP So actually the big rationale here for the North to

00:15:53.810 --> 00:16:00.230
 the northeast was that those who have less received more then double is relative there goes up

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:07.230
 make an emergency aid as the name says is already bye is momentary

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:13.220
 in some they want it to be eternal to Dias where he will withdraw money he had a one

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:19.010
 i ***** that these days a tip a huge list of Social Security debtors

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:24.330
 Talk to the guys to charge you these charges are people to be used now this

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:28.200
 parliamentarian who did this if he had a little knowledge was not so well

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:32.970
 magogo squeeze in a project that this resource would be to make it signed

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:36.990
 emergency aid it is very easy to criticize when one is aware of the

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:40.890
 things that make demagogy right and make a carnival with these more humble ones

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:47.010
 need a lot of your child and we want to help help those

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:52.490
 people in need of that they drown cooked the health care system we

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:59.580
 come on look hello all to ask you a question to

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:04.770
 that you can do for the first time here from the climate guys at Isaac makes the mistake

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:09.300
 early treatment its your touching observation there that that you think

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:14.780
 which is talking about it here is fundamental There is no other way out But

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:19.949
 we diagnose mos by the doctor as soon as possible to start the treatment

00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:25.589
 early as soon as possible This is it What life saver is this that avoids

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:32.130
 that people get worse and I have to go to an ICU encouraged by Quina glue and

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:37.370
 of her routine Anitta ivermectina has existed for decades

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:44.480
 a personal agreement is with worm it is common right to accept ivermectin I have

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:49.910
 once a year I always took it out now it was a coincidence this also happened

00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:55.370
 helps to decrease viral load is a finding of tens of thousands and

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:59.690
 doctor we only have almost 500 thousand meters Brazil with 30 ml same or only believe

00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:05.510
 all right now i'm an alternative is to stay home when you feel short of breath and for the

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:11.150
 hospital How to encourage TV Globo here with your marketer mandetta you will

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:14.370
 to Hospital Do what if there is no medicine

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:19.350
 and even in the one-handed protocol it was to be used there, cocaine was in

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:24.960
 home a serious case everyone knows I haven't done any I took two

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.950
 achievements you're doing well took too or just the girl who had the shape

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:34.080
 beautiful and it won't hurt it has scientific proof Not yet but no

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:39.000
 it’s bad if you don’t want to take it, don’t take it, but don’t talk nonsense and

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.790
 trying to give up whoever was going to take it doesn’t hurt and even it was very

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:49.980
 butchered a little while ago saying that ours here in the cause for us half

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.870
 the question of approximately two months the European Society of Cardiology

00:18:53.870 --> 00:19:00.160
 said it does not cause arrhythmia Oi and TV Globo in the 2016 program if not

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.330
 I'm wrong there were people announcing there from a press conference saying that there was no

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:09.430
 done with the troop the pregnant women that was used to fight Zika love the

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:13.510
 formation right the cerebral São Miguel of the children

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:18.640
 then it became a crime and they started criticizing me

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:23.920
 money, right, from TV Globo, no more pawns jumping from the official propaganda of the

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:28.900
 government then I say Ok but there is no problem this company source

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:32.290
 lost that cattle from Brazil that we regret lost that one from Brazil

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:36.340
 but also then the treatment for when it's right with me plus 200 people

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:42.580
 of my building to pick up there by invitation ok and as far as I know no one was even

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:46.420
 to the hospital there was a woman who was going to work at home who had

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:51.700
 problems and picked it up at home and then there were other problems in the other novelty

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:55.900
 ended up dying out of that to 200 people of our black no one even

00:19:55.900 --> 00:20:02.260
 was the first question to him What is it

00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:10.389
 The book is possible to make a prognosis for the beginning of vaccination before

00:20:10.389 --> 00:20:14.679
 approval by Anvisa of the respective vaccines considering that it can

00:20:14.679 --> 00:20:25.090
 certify or not thank you thank you that you use authorization is required to

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:31.720
 emergency use or the definitive registration to apply any vaccine from the

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:37.960
 So this is not a fact It will be applied to vaccines in Brazil will be

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:44.070
 vaccines applied without emergency authorization or the definitive registration

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:53.519
 by Anvisa defending the efficacy and safety of that immunizer is not

00:20:53.519 --> 00:20:59.870
 high at the moment and we have in Brazil being worked on

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:05.690
 part of the emergency authorization for the Butantã vaccine and that of transgenics that are

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:09.919
 private parts manufactured in Brazil and will be published in Brazil is not

00:21:09.919 --> 00:21:14.649
 saying that they are being manufactured from Butantã, Anvisa will analyze the process

00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:21.919
 and when that Anvisa makes authorization for emergency use we already made the

00:21:21.919 --> 00:21:28.370
 contracting these vaccines and the owner distributing them through our penis there is a

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:33.679
 the possibility that he would be in Brazil for a few weeks for sure we

00:21:33.679 --> 00:21:39.139
 we have three periods well defined by the Ministry until the 20th of January in

00:21:39.139 --> 00:21:44.000
 period of what I consider there a better hypothesis from January 20 to December 10

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.090
 February would be average and Boots and from February 10 until the end of until the

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:55.039
 end of February beginning of March that would be a long term there but more doors

00:21:55.039 --> 00:21:58.470
 is it is more time consuming we are working

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:03.779
 importing vaccines from astrazeneca and seeing the factory of the

00:22:03.779 --> 00:22:08.630
 rear of India two million doses for now to arrive in Brazil

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:13.730
 in parallel the authorization for emergency use in order to be distributed

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:19.289
 Butantã already has Six Million Dollars also imported, requested the

00:22:19.289 --> 00:22:23.880
 emergency authorization as soon as this has happened by Anvisa Nós

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:29.700
 we also distribute it through the penis this is the beginning but we must not forget that

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:35.179
 Brazil has 210 million inhabitants and an effective vaccination program

00:22:35.179 --> 00:22:41.399
 you need 20 and 30 million doses per month and that’s what we’re looking for with

00:22:41.399 --> 00:22:47.070
 Brazilian factories curiosity so the company saying all the time that the

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:49.570
 Brazil did not start vaccination So come on

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:55.440
 the percentage of people vaccinated our country the father that lowest until the

00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:00.060
 time was Israel fifteen percent got it worth a million three hundred thousand people

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:06.060
 perfect is equivalent to this is more or less more or less is percent of

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:10.970
 population of the state of Rio de Janeiro 1 million and three hundred doses applied

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:17.970
 so it's around seven 650 thousand people center two shots to second place

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:23.340
 with eight percent of its population who took the United States vaccine an email

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:28.950
 percent and then almost everyone here below one percent now appears

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:33.510
 here a laboratory sold a percentage a very small amount of vaccine

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:40.440
 for some countries this is exactly the vaccine today there are two vaccines there that

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:51.299
 are running strong the failure and the Russian Sputnik the vaccine to do it she

00:23:51.299 --> 00:23:55.710
 and we are still working with the company to try to reduce the

00:23:55.710 --> 00:24:02.580
 restrictive contracting clauses for Ramos so she was sold to

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:07.739
 several multi-country countries but with quantitative doses Very small doses then

00:24:07.739 --> 00:24:13.289
 time there applying eight thousand doses of 12 thousand doses 31 thousand doses So when you

00:24:13.289 --> 00:24:21.179
 if you add up all the doses of vaccines applied in the world divided by 2 that only

00:24:21.179 --> 00:24:26.489
 people, right, you don't even have the city of Rio de Janeiro so it's complicated

00:24:26.489 --> 00:24:32.539
 when we are asked if we are late We are

00:24:32.539 --> 00:24:41.159
 putting together the biggest vaccination plan in the world and it starts in the next 45 days my

00:24:41.159 --> 00:24:45.769
 I just put We can be the next videos and the

00:24:45.769 --> 00:24:51.380
 people are on the wave, right, we're delaying, we're in a hurry between you and me

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:56.480
 that the vaccine exists Anvisa is not that it will have to be respected it will be

00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:01.669
 respected even by cancer the past of a job has always only been missing we are not

00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:05.870
 only the vaccine defends any medicine that arrives in Brazil here

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:10.760
 so you can put it on the shelf in the pharmacies to sell it, you have to go through

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:15.350
 by Anvisa my life does an exceptional job the vision that delay life

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:19.730
 no one wants to protect life because the labs from what I know how to breed

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:24.889
 correct me there he doesn't want to take any responsibility in case

00:25:24.889 --> 00:25:30.260
 collateral is exactly that there this laboratory is that we are trying

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:36.380
 import, they require a complete exemption from liability for the effects

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:41.600
 Kipling's collateral and infinite future is an emergency vaccine You don't have

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:47.490
 scientific proof the irresponsibility any authority

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:52.740
 from Brazil say that if you don’t take it in my state in your city you’ll

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:57.690
 suffer certain sanctions buy example there is a parliamentarian here in Brasilia of the PT

00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:02.640
 represented the project on the digital bed so forbidden then the father who did not

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.000
 his parents did not get vaccinated putting a child in public or private school is going

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.390
 stay at home smell him and the other I don't know in the Senator also from

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:14.600
 republic and tightened the project eight years in jail

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:20.140
 and for those who do not get a vaccine and there’s no point what’s going on

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:24.700
 it's an experimental thing we don't have scientific proof the vaccine

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:31.800
 mandatory one that she is She is a fait accompli she is

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:37.330
 tested and approved all over the world, there’s the vaccine, thanks to this one, you don’t

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:41.700
 you can say this is mandatory The vaccine that has not been proven yet and

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:45.940
 Experimental and any the lab can enter with the missing documentation the

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:49.810
 life asking right So that it is applied in an emergency way that

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:55.780
 any Russian Sputnik can get naked at Anvisa E if it is approved that

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:59.890
 you will have to apply stay stay apply to purchase will buy of course any there

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:05.560
 ball interests me where our security is our Visa That's it we

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:10.240
 we have to be responsible I cannot enter the pile of some thinking that

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:14.590
 we have to run others even as the governor of a great state because

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:21.240
 this is mandatory and not permissible to enter into this subject but then discuss

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:26.700
 and more is not it only God I said democracy of Brazil too

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:30.330
 you cannot impose your will on people saying it is protecting life

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:35.610
 first person who has to have to protect the life of that person themselves

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:39.900
 Oh, always do not do what if you govern the course a few there because the

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:45.390
 executive authorities of the executive want to enter Brazil and irresponsible will be

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:50.640
 that this guy is so concerned with the life of the next one or if he

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:55.470
 have other concerns in this big negotiation another question has conditions

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:57.590
 Ouch

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:04.529
 Hi Ana Paula rica o bolsonaro Good night Minister case and Lu

00:28:04.529 --> 00:28:09.460
 Minister the question I have for you is the following we have already delivered

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:15.820
 We are here in the program some infectious disease doctors who say about the danger of

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:22.750
 you put a viral load or a vaccine on top of an organism that has already

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:28.720
 passed through the disease and who may already have antibodies to those viruses to

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.980
 for those people in Brazil who want to get the vaccine but who don't have

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:39.309
 sure they passed asymptomatically by covid-19 the government

00:28:39.309 --> 00:28:44.950
 is going to provide some kind of exam so that these people are sure if

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:49.450
 passed asymptomatically through the coronavirus so that they could take the

00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:57.850
 vaccine is safer Thank you good night Good night Ana Paula

00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:03.320
 thank you for your question i will go backwards the answer yes to

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:09.950
 we distribute the rt-pcr tests to all all states all

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:16.399
 municipalities and it really is through SUS EA free so the government already has this

00:29:16.399 --> 00:29:24.799
 the policy of making the tests available is all available to all Brazilians and I ask

00:29:24.799 --> 00:29:29.870
 authorization to the inspector Shopkeepers to doctors I am not a doctor much less

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:35.870
 infectious disease but after listening to my team over these eight months

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:39.450
 I can tell you two things the first

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:44.840
 and the and the risk that you have

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:53.240
 is to put the vaccine on someone who has had the coronavirus he is a risk

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:58.190
 very small or practically nonexistent Unless this virus

00:29:58.190 --> 00:30:05.059
 it was an attenuated virus the attenuated virus vaccine He's one he's only

00:30:05.059 --> 00:30:11.809
 attenuated and if you could in this case we could say that this vaccine is not

00:30:11.809 --> 00:30:17.690
 in this case with that technology could have some other some other

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:24.320
 consequence but these are taking away this possibility of the attenuated virus that we

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:30.830
 we have no negotiation of vaccine with attenuated virus in Brazil or in Butantã, which is

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:38.750
 Inactive virus nor in the Nica Fiocruz phase which is RNA is another technology is

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:44.240
 this this this reality there it is outside of our remit at this moment outside of

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:50.850
 ours and now new technologies common all

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:56.280
 the ones that are being offered today they need to be tested over

00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:02.280
 specific groups groups of people who have HIV group of people who have

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:07.380
 cancer group of people who have other comorbidities and other diseases

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:13.460
 autoimmune so that's why the testing phase is very long so there are

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:21.030
 say phase 3 being completed or partly completed for some groups and

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:28.050
 other groups like serious children and people with these types of diseases and

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:34.290
 as news And still need to be observed from PC and

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:38.370
 and so mental so it is a one to understand I have more responsibility

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:43.890
 that he compel someone to get a vaccine and click Seco ah when you apply a

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:50.160
 vaccine or medicine that does not have a definitive registration the law is Clara who

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:55.140
 taking it you have to be fully aware and declare that you have the

00:31:55.140 --> 00:32:01.800
 conscience to be able to take if you cannot apply a vaccine and no human being is

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:07.710
 it is assuming that the person understands he has to declare that he understands to declare

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:11.790
 the garbage that she may be running this is foreseen in the documentation of

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:15.390
 Anvisa and Tá provided for in our Constitution would be a term of

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:19.860
 responsibility is not the term of responsibility but rather it is understanding

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:26.909
 she she is clear that it occurs only have skill was ours

00:32:26.909 --> 00:32:32.999
 and apply it together with the laboratory that manufactures it to the extent

00:32:32.999 --> 00:32:36.809
 provisional is written there that the person who will receive the vaccine she will be

00:32:36.809 --> 00:32:40.799
 Guidance on defect risks is an obligation

00:32:40.799 --> 00:32:44.519
 does not have the responsible term, she has to sign nothing more, whoever is going to apply

00:32:44.519 --> 00:32:49.080
 will tell that person your João Dona Maria the problem that can happen

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:54.389
 we are not responsible, we will only take this risk and I'm not doing it

00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:59.609
 campaign against the vaccine nor in favor this is an awareness thing

00:32:59.609 --> 00:33:04.470
 some will do a massive vaccine campaign only the vaccine campaign

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:09.509
 clarification and you at the end of the line decide if you’re going to get a vaccine or not I

00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:13.710
 I need to help you here in a position that is very technical and I

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:18.899
 I need to put it here so as not to get an idea, the idea crossed is at the moment

00:33:18.899 --> 00:33:26.129
 we the federal government to buy the immunizer distributed by the penis and

00:33:26.129 --> 00:33:30.340
 apply and in the population through SUS to

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:35.620
 degree of responsibility wow this is non-transferable so you have to have

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:42.280
 Anvisa has to do its previous work and has to declare safety

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:46.810
 and effectiveness of that work when Anvisa does not have this possibility of

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:52.090
 register and authorize emergency use Then we have to

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:58.510
 enter the clarification Claro and according to Anvisa manuals without aa

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:02.890
 person who claims to be aware of it This is a discussion that can still be

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:10.330
 in depth is not definitive but we at no time try to pass this

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:15.100
 responsibility to person or exempt us from our responsibility to

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:20.890
 government's responsibility is to have a competent regulatory agency capable of

00:34:20.890 --> 00:34:26.500
 some gives security AND effectiveness this is our responsibility from then on

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:30.349
 people what to answer for that was to put a

00:34:30.349 --> 00:34:35.529
 project in Congress giving 72 hours to Anvisa

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:41.390
 and if you are responsible for that or you don’t say anything and from that moment the

00:34:41.390 --> 00:34:46.030
 the vaccine is released, I vetoed it, this is the responsibility

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:51.169
 it's in my face that I got in the traditional family that we have there is going to

00:34:51.169 --> 00:34:55.460
 holding Congress accountable decided to overturn the veto so this is in the law

00:34:55.460 --> 00:35:00.950
 so far we are going over there that was going to be deadline is being negotiated for 10

00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:06.170
 days but still some I think I should press Anvisa how am I going

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:10.850
 interfere in Anvisa Notifies the independent agency an agency completely

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:15.890
 Independence the people who are there All have a four-year term when

00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:20.510
 ends the mandate has a vote in the senate of names appointed by the executive

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:26.930
 and once approved and if that person will stay at that agency in the Anvisa case for

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:30.190
 four years now irresponsibility my

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:33.970
 it is because he appeared at Anvisa first that I will not I will not admit a

00:35:33.970 --> 00:35:39.069
 pressure that just messing with lives This is a serious thing so the

00:35:39.069 --> 00:35:43.270
 hurried there you have to understand this business or do it trying to wear out

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:49.329
 people politically now on my part I will not be under pressure from anyone

00:35:49.329 --> 00:35:53.980
 I will repeat here that if they hit a lot I do not care for any kind of

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:59.710
 pressure we have is responsibility is that I said the same

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:04.000
 so much hitting I take a piece of the phrase and the dough and stay on top of us

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:10.660
 Show me an audio or video where I’m talking for example which is a

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:16.020
 you don't have to try to give mine you don't have mine saying that to me

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:21.490
 so what was true when I was hit by the glass not feeling anything I took

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:25.210
 it was only here the next day it was long and I just didn't go back to work at

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:28.930
 presidency because the protocol said that you have to stay at home until you don’t

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:32.360
 had more to hear Good morning ended up happening your side

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:37.340
 day later and I went back to work and I felt nothing for me I said to my

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:43.040
 physical situation, right, go from life to practice and then you are not mistaken 56 o

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:52.370
 anniversary of Brazil said that those who have a life of Atlética taking care of

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:56.810
 your running health does exercise the chance was forty percent less and

00:36:56.810 --> 00:37:02.780
 for against the virus they install in a serious way and lead you to an illness

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:07.670
 to hospitalization until death then agreed with me as they agreed

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:12.290
 also the function of his vitamin so there is already research it is proven that whoever

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:18.080
 has a high rate of vitamin D I felt absolutely nothing healthy

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:22.020
 asymptomatic and another and make it clear here we don't have to

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:27.390
 speak to our government's happened no tax was a journey of ours

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:31.830
 government quite the contrary more than 500 so we decreased one of the last

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:37.619
 now import tax on syringes and needles Congratulations to the patron

00:37:37.619 --> 00:37:42.180
 then congratulations to Minister Paulo Guedes, contrary to the Governor's motorbike,

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:46.650
 everything increased even in the treatment today there in his condition okay then

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:50.760
 responsibility on the part of a few bar on our part we are

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:55.130
 doing the right thing another one that's

00:37:55.510 --> 00:38:00.580
 increasing by lowering the crime This is a poor crime I had a hard time

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:06.460
 unemployment low wages inflation in the basic basket is a governor there in the na

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:13.510
 hard cane, you know, increase taxes and things that influence the basic basket

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:20.350
 a crime is an electoral crime Hi good night president 'Cristo Qual a

00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:24.430
 your opinion on the possibility that private laboratories may also

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:29.980
 offers a vaccine against invite some people have criticized saying that with

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:34.630
 this people who are not in the priority group would receive one before

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:39.040
 people who do belong to the priority groups but have other

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:43.450
 people who do not say that a good initiative because it will make

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:48.280
 the vaccination process is speeded up so that the campaign counts faster as

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:51.520
 Opinion of the Minister One Night to you good evening the president bolsonaro

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:58.930
 Good night Vítor is everything has two sides, but I think the first thing we

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:05.760
 we need until the next age of the government of the Ministry in and we will

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:11.620
 complement complete our demand for vaccines for SUS

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:17.260
 that's it I'm to our factories the great buying ability well given that the

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:22.740
 manufactured in Brazil will be all manufactured in Brazil once this demand is met

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:32.680
 and already those with SUS having attended Yes, of course there is not and should be purchased

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:39.010
 also by the initiative by the private initiative and mainly imported from

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:43.690
 imported factories foreign laboratories that sell the vaccine that

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:48.820
 sell the vaccine in which registration in Brazil that has authorization given by

00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:54.790
 Anvisa Guarantee its effectiveness and safety because I cannot buy from

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:58.930
 imported from international laboratories I think they should buy

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:05.470
 But I remember that on the other side, we have to have a lot of capacity to supply

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:11.630
 the single health system and leave our population completely

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:16.850
 the vaccines available as soon as possible i have two lines because of

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:21.110
 protest to see you for example it's offering for free and

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:27.260
 voluntary vaccine from three three laboratories ok ok and the and the other

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:34.100
 laboratory that you didn't you didn't made one didn't buy and case for example some

00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:36.970
 here in Brazil I want this vaccine responds

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:42.550
 good then without too much trouble the only thing that in Brazil any medicine

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:46.930
 the immunizer has to pass in which passed a knife on the table I think a

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:51.340
 great idea so it will create a problem when it comes to whoever wants a

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:55.570
 company wants to buy the vaccine abroad and sell it here who has the resource will

00:40:55.570 --> 00:41:01.510
 take a vaccine there now we will offer it in a universal way and on our part there

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:06.180
 mandatory process he

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:11.030
 what does that mean

00:41:12.849 --> 00:41:19.839
 I know that the ninety-nine percent of the population approximately does not run

00:41:19.839 --> 00:41:25.269
 lethal risk with green color 19 however some authorities I

00:41:25.269 --> 00:41:31.859
 personally state officials raise the issue of vaccinating the entire population

00:41:31.859 --> 00:41:38.890
 as the only possibility of resuming the coexistence of society as a whole is

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:44.069
 how to move that kind of logic and that kind of proposition

00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:52.650
 and thank you that I use is something that I put talking to the medical class is

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:58.140
 that everything is relative everything is very relative when it comes to disease

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:03.599
 when it comes to people is what works for the may not work for

00:42:03.599 --> 00:42:11.099
 drinking what the risks are are the individuals right And we have our

00:42:11.099 --> 00:42:18.059
 individualities also in relation to who is really at risk of dying

00:42:18.059 --> 00:42:24.569
 I would like to put some data here But which ones are correct for us to put in

00:42:24.569 --> 00:42:35.040
 up deaths 75 percent one of the excuse deaths is

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:43.830
 there are 75 percent of deaths in Brazil so far for codigio Pedras Pará codigio

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:47.920
 happened people over 50 years old

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:54.400
 the skewer is very well a profile of people who are at greater risk of

00:42:54.400 --> 00:43:00.890
 looked like this disease and the rest of the other 25 percent has

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:07.340
 under 50 who passed away if you take away the people who have as obda

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:12.450
 says others as a skill we will be very low numbers

00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:18.390
 It also demonstrates the profile of what we are talking about. It demonstrates that

00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:24.960
 people over 50 need to vote the healthiest of healthiest

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:30.420
 possible possible people have to play sports eat well slept

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:38.400
 well is to take your vitamins is to make life as healthy as possible so don't

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:46.650
 this is not say let's say merit is only possible for those who have money

00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:53.280
 money to lead a healthy life depends on the habits of each one so if we

00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:59.670
 there we are focused on keeping our immunity high healthy states

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:06.780
 This is a really great response for this audience to those over 50

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:12.460
 years the understanding what goes right what goes wrong Inter

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:19.630
 to restrictive measures this is a big is going to be a big unknown over the

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:25.390
 time that no one really knows the result on top of this coronavirus

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:31.119
 of this disease but it is very clear that we need to have follow-up

00:44:31.119 --> 00:44:37.510
 everyone's doctor as effective as possible and as quickly

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:43.359
 possible to diagnose and treat if we have early treatment that

00:44:43.359 --> 00:44:50.200
 percentage will drop and drop radically so what do we need there

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:57.250
 we need to maintain the health of the population mainly above 50 years at the top

00:44:57.250 --> 00:45:06.099
 level maintaining people's emotional balance decreasing this feeling is that it is

00:45:06.099 --> 00:45:14.900
 real scared with regards to hello everything that happens in I return this

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:20.859
 sensation needs the Bible session to be tackled it needs to be treated with

00:45:20.859 --> 00:45:28.609
 that kind of position which is staying healthy staying well fed if

00:45:28.609 --> 00:45:36.800
 to maintain is Practicing physical activities and mainly to look for the accompaniment

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:41.300
 doctor as soon as possible if we do that the risk goes down

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:47.690
 exponentially when I talk about fitness we have 20

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:52.440
 clubs loss of vision and i'm going to kick here the total 500 athlete

00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:58.530
 the future maybe because the more because the less someone has news of a player

00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:02.820
 football of the intubated tissue division i don't have anybody having a news from the

00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:08.610
 second division so only about a thousand players then the proof that

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:13.020
 this person, right, if you have this life, you can see Flamengo played with

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:17.010
 Palmeiras in the first round o Almost every team reserves because of

00:46:17.010 --> 00:46:24.720
 from the chain to the game it was 0 to 0 about seeing an ok then it’s the one who has this tie

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:29.610
 physical as I am despite 65 years of age but it is there in Dinha my

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:38.070
 I am looking for a food habit, no problem, no, it's been

00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:43.150
 talking was an exception it wasn’t a session and he picked up what day that was

00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:47.530
 specials another minister do another even have constant physical activity

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:51.580
 Milton caught nobody when I caught it I heard Milton See a doctor

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:57.160
 then taking a few more things took was good the next day so we ran

00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:03.280
 also who is almost my age is under 50 and you can see who

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:09.550
 go to the beach with Constância, just start researching this data is not

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:13.710
 because you’re on the beach but what a beach town and who goes to the beach

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:21.160
 catches a sun and the sun is the ixtreme having children and vitamin D in the body had

00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:26.230
 no serious problems so we even have the solution there Some people always stay

00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:29.980
 hitting up to has no scientific proof the guy pays I know no

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:34.240
 have what she pays for But in a few years time there will be like back there doing you not

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:40.339
 is the remedy like me in the pacific war where the soldier arrives

00:47:40.339 --> 00:47:44.719
 Oh and there was no blood transfusion because everyone who could even travel

00:47:44.719 --> 00:47:50.299
 already had transfusion use coconut water imagine Nowadays coconut water doesn’t

00:47:50.299 --> 00:47:54.019
 has scientific proof Just don't go to inject coconut water in the arm the guy will

00:47:54.019 --> 00:47:58.700
 dying coconut oil is not bad for anyone even in the vein it was bad aunt is not

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:03.589
 get it right I went there you ate medium she was talking but there is no blood touched the

00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:08.599
 anything goes here does not have a proven remedy has no sign of

00:48:08.599 --> 00:48:12.739
 when you have it, it will be a very cheap thing, right, the vaccine is expensive, so O

00:48:12.739 --> 00:48:17.390
 interest is a name for the vaccine it was very expensive and we teach here you come

00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:21.829
 a provisional measure and 20 billion reais to buy a vaccine you don't even

00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:26.950
 December she passed so we're doing the right thing with

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:32.359
 responsibility is not a race for elections that lie ahead election

00:48:32.359 --> 00:48:36.229
 It doesn’t matter to me what interests me to solve this problem now and

00:48:36.229 --> 00:48:40.349
 i prefer to do 14 mandate with a responsibility

00:48:40.349 --> 00:48:45.390
 what responsible attention for a possible re-election so we're

00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:50.489
 doing the right thing and we have to prove it all there and the miserable he

00:48:50.489 --> 00:48:54.089
 it's behaving difficultly you have approximately 5,000 employees

00:48:54.089 --> 00:48:58.650
 with you with 1,570 Our mother this is the number of municipalities there to get

00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:03.239
 it's not true i'm wrong 5,500 keep sending me it's almost a city

00:49:03.239 --> 00:49:08.039
 You took your denying the video you take about 20 to work with you

00:49:08.039 --> 00:49:14.039

 and how to get rich pear pear because i got method

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:22.829
 Figueiredo Paulo allows himself Paulo I personally knew your grandfather is right

00:50:22.829 --> 00:50:28.950
 when he left the presence of a colleague of mine is captain Moraes known to

00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:35.569
 nickname blue snake I don’t know why he was your grandfather’s aide and

00:50:35.569 --> 00:50:39.529
 worked with him served with him when he commanded the MT If I'm not mistaken too

00:50:39.529 --> 00:50:42.989
 so when he left the presidency from time to time i would go there on the

00:50:42.989 --> 00:50:47.160
 Nogueira chatting with him I was active, right, captain of the relative E

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:53.260
 logically for me I was seeing Nilton in front of me right and I learned

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:58.569
 something with him and I made some friends with him obviously right because I went

00:50:58.569 --> 00:51:03.339
 there dough a little more than 10 times there at the Nogueira farm so there’s a big thank you

00:51:03.339 --> 00:51:07.539
 Your grandfather's remembrance has Paulinho as your son. Paulinho is yours

00:51:07.539 --> 00:51:11.500
 father your uncle also had a certain friendship with him there in Barra da Tijuca

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:16.190
 So congratulations there for being in the old one of Vivo

00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:23.030
 the minister despite the conviviality that a lethality in children less than

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:27.530
 common flu and the very low transmission among them some states already

00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:32.450
 are saying they will require vaccinations to correct so that children can

00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:36.140
 school enrollment how can the ministry of education

00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:46.550
 health see this type of action well I see it with concern Because although we are

00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:53.720
 with phase 3 vaccines with emergency use authorization being proposed to a group

00:51:53.720 --> 00:52:01.130
 children are not yet tested correctly so vaccines in

00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:07.550
 principle are not yet ready to be used on children is a group

00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:13.339
 although the testing phase needs to be completed, it is not possible for us now but

00:52:13.339 --> 00:52:16.170
 now we can say that it is not even possible

00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:23.220
 and still need to do the tests i'm premature to put it this way there are people

00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:26.760
 that did not give due importance to municipal elections and mayors who

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:30.690
 also closed everything if I am not mistaken to have in São Paulo Araraquara If I am not

00:52:30.690 --> 00:52:36.480
 mistake the mayor even saw his municipal guard seized a woman in the square

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:42.599
 public alone and was re-launched he gets these ideas uses maybe lacked the

00:52:42.599 --> 00:52:46.980
 population ask the candidate at the time Look will you continue with the

00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:53.730
 measures or not And why now folks come back and here the mayor are not all

00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:58.099
 some mayors in my opinion makes a proposal such a measure that

00:52:58.099 --> 00:53:04.970
 o goes beyond the Rays of Absurd one thing that is experimental doesn’t have no

00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:08.799
 know what can happen to a child require to do Ours is

00:53:08.799 --> 00:53:14.869
 regrettable the position of that Mayor who takes the measure with this other

00:53:14.869 --> 00:53:17.019
 question

00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:30.170
 Victor white of how long the vaccination campaign should last one year

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:39.230
 one more year it is possible to predict this is possible our our our plan it

00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:43.880
 we are expected to sign fifty percent of the target population

00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:49.789
 until July of June detail of the year and the other 50 percent until December in

00:53:49.789 --> 00:53:57.130
 end of the year with a margin of four more months that would be a margin for

00:53:57.130 --> 00:54:03.079
 look for some group that hasn't been totally fascinated So

00:54:03.079 --> 00:54:08.180
 our forecast here in 12 months everyone the target audience is vaccinated in

00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:16.130
 Brazil still having a margin of four more months it is important to state that

00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:21.480
 the biggest objective is our control to be able to go at the time that

00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:27.690
 you control the pandemic and contamination rates fall and life begins to

00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:33.539
 get back to normal and your big goal and this is the focus of ours is the focus of our

00:54:33.539 --> 00:54:43.039
 of our vaccination campaign in relation to a It was not that question right

00:54:43.039 --> 00:54:48.720
 so asking here you will see the holiday during the carnival Face holiday

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:52.920
 it’s a federal law so the idea of ​​ours is logically not to create any audio if

00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:57.059
 keep the holiday but what will it skip not carnival so there will be no Carnival

00:54:57.059 --> 00:55:01.230
 it’s another story and we don’t intend to maintain that it’s a religious holiday

00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:06.520
 denying the carnival that's right it is a religious holiday is tuesday

00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:10.789
 Monday and Tuesday So let's keep it here

00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:17.559
 good and everyone is responsible for their actions is another question is

00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:25.310
 the hour Figueiredo the porn video of Minister who is formed

00:55:25.310 --> 00:55:29.720
 newspapers in Brazil have the impression that the country took a long time to buy and

00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:34.130
 operationalize vaccines in fact there are some countries that have already started their

00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:39.980
 federal government vaccination process It took some time to act in relation to

00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:45.260
 vaccines or everything is within the expected pace Hi Paulo we talked a lot

00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:52.250
 about it already here on live but I can’t shy away from putting the following is the

00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:58.070
 offer of vaccine purchased from outside it is very small the quantities are

00:55:58.070 --> 00:56:03.950
 low EA delivery date is long This is what you see in virtually all

00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:10.480
 them for you to know Jansen who is one of the best vaccines that we observe

00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:18.380
 it is only expected to be delivered in the second quarter and three million doses.

00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:24.750
 very little modern than the other Vaz the American cut and that is also

00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:31.920
 coming from coming there offering your your your brand she speaks in 8 million

00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:37.740
 doses in October and to be done regardless of the

00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:45.450
 complicated clauses that she tries to impose on us she talks about Two Billion doses

00:56:45.450 --> 00:56:51.300
 in the first quarter and Six Million elderly people in the second quarter ie we

00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:56.790
 we do not have the capacity to vaccinate anything or very little with the

00:56:56.790 --> 00:57:01.950
 imported vaccines we've been based on for the past six years

00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:07.860
 months 5 months in the production capacity of the Brazilian factories we invest

00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:15.450
 million reais to retrofit Fiocruz and we signed an agreement of 70 80

00:57:15.450 --> 00:57:20.640
 million reais with Butantã to retrofit and increase the capacity of

00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:26.340
 his production to be able to also do the vaccine against invitation is in this bet that

00:57:26.340 --> 00:57:31.200
 we have to be at the door of vaccines manufactured in Brazil and in the quantities

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:38.799
 necessary for our country's is us if you observe the

00:57:38.799 --> 00:57:44.049
 that is happening around Brazil and in most countries in the world are

00:57:44.049 --> 00:57:49.960
 meager numbers of vaccinees that pity we could not even begin to vaccinate with eight

00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:57.250
 thousand doses 15 thousand doses 30 thousand doses that for us would not be compatible we

00:57:57.250 --> 00:58:07.150
 start we will be making the population to enter in another one another Vale

00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:12.250
 Babi that interests us where you would have only a small group vaccinated us

00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:18.430
 we are planning and with a lot of objectivity

00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:24.580
 fall in love there is always the twentieth of January and the day

00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:29.890
 the first of February, that is, in that period of the Initial Rose, our

00:58:29.890 --> 00:58:37.540
 plan I cannot I will not put a specific date here the specific day

00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:43.570
 because it would be playing with the hope of each one I need to have the vaccine

00:58:43.570 --> 00:58:48.580
 registered by Anvisa or authorized and must have the effective manufacture of

00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:54.700
 quantitative of elderly and allow the beginning having in your hand is up to five days

00:58:54.700 --> 00:59:00.369
 I distribute it to the states and municipalities You already have money left over from it the

00:59:00.369 --> 00:59:04.540
 money of the year Since last year 20 billion reais is just to make the contract

00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:09.100
 now some think the vaccine is available

00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:14.440
 bringing it here is not like that, it doesn’t even matter, it’s not available and no and you have to

00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:19.780
 pass again I have to go through Anvisa Look, we have 10 10 million

00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:24.980
 Brazilian This is a huge market these companies

00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:30.740
 And if I were the entrepreneur in the business and offered Brazil I don't know about Paraguay

00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:33.980
 with the inhabitants São should be about four minutes five million I don’t know but

00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:39.099
 is a product that I am instead of selling Paraguay to resell in Brazil now

00:59:39.099 --> 00:59:44.829
 there’s not enough and there’s a problem for them, right, our National Agency for

00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:47.930
 Health Surveillance one of the most respected in the world

00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:52.600
 Sesc SESC in Paraguay the brigadier seven million what was predicted here

00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:59.360
 so he knows that someone doesn’t look once Now I know you only

00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:08.170
 number warns was Butantan EA Fiocruz it's on time now now this week we've already

01:00:08.170 --> 01:00:14.720
 the Chemical Union that represents Sputnik there is already in negotiations already

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:18.470
 I asked for phase 3 in Brazil the guys who are accused of being late or is it the

01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:23.720
 ignorant and incompetent or want to make a political move against us nothing

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:28.240
 beyond that and we have Responsibility now thanks to God

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:35.030
 Anvisa exists thanks to God it is respected not the penalty for its

01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:39.650
 president and directors as well as by all employees because these

01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:44.660
 employees is what really led Anvisa to this degree of responsibility

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:47.940
 of confidence around the world, I'm thinking

01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:51.600
 what to sell to us and to some other countries a very big difference

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:56.370
 no one will show screen at Anvisa I called to get to Anvisa and want to negotiate

01:00:56.370 --> 01:01:03.030
 something releases there will not have this will not have this even for the repeat right for

01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:07.770
 training of its professionals by its entire president when the

01:01:07.770 --> 01:01:15.720
 president Eduardo Vargas is the bar is the neighborhood Santo Antônio / doctor Almirante

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:23.070
 doctor who has a great ancestry is very respected from Globo to the

01:01:23.070 --> 01:01:28.890
 vivo was humiliated by him humiliated on TV Globo live so much that the clothes didn’t

01:01:28.890 --> 01:01:33.480
 want to talk to him just by recording I told him right my friend I

01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:40.200
 I don't have any interference there, look if I were you on Globo, right, just saw Evita o

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:44.970
 problem here, you know, then you will talk, I record it doesn't match anymore, so

01:01:44.970 --> 01:01:47.950
 we have responsibility to the population

01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:52.720
 and nothing running over and I will not interfere as it does not interfere in

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:57.369
 nowhere I have the power to change baby but in your power to change anyone

01:01:57.369 --> 01:02:02.650
 Anvisa and would never do that because it would be messing with the life of you who

01:02:02.650 --> 01:02:07.349
 is watching us there another video A

01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:20.640
 the Victor degree again in other countries has some kind of plan for case

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:25.790
 it happen to see hi hi Vitor thanks again yes we

01:02:25.790 --> 01:02:34.850
 we have followed adverse reactions mainly from peace, right?

01:02:34.850 --> 01:02:42.290
 being used in a greater number of countries and we observed 12 cases of reactions

01:02:42.290 --> 01:02:49.820
 serious adverse events accompanying us each is just reactions that start with the part

01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:56.270
 allergic and some other complications but as we imagine it is always everything

01:02:56.270 --> 01:03:03.700
 an unprecedented thing right and the number the number the number of cases of adverse reactions

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:08.540
 he is he is within the expected he is high but he is within the expected

01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:14.690
 we can observe Yes we are following without already checking

01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:19.359
 12 cases with little more than a little more severity and we are observing

01:03:19.359 --> 01:03:27.849
 we haven't bought the stage so far I ended up two more will continue the

01:03:27.849 --> 01:03:37.599
 program by and then after 8 pm she uses the infectologist week

01:03:37.599 --> 01:03:40.839
 Respected shopkeepers in the scientific community have expressed concern

01:03:40.839 --> 01:03:47.799
 with the short development cycle of current vaccines 19 this issue

01:03:47.799 --> 01:03:56.380
 also worries the web mister uses yes of course yes and i want to put here

01:03:56.380 --> 01:04:00.880
 I'm not going to make a defense, but let's put the following back side

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:06.910
 today we talk about the vaccine it takes 4 years 6 years to develop and

01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:14.670
 tested yes but there has never been a confluence of so many people and

01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:20.650
 equipment, structures and technology in the world simultaneously to be able to

01:04:20.650 --> 01:04:26.750
 develop vaccines then and it tends to be a shorter term use the

01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:36.170
 I answered because if you have a budget of 10 10 moneys and a

01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:44.180
 number of people is 20 people to test And you have a budget today of

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:51.670
 100 you can test on 50 thousand people So the time limit really tends to decrease

01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:58.190
 but what you have previous news is that the deadline for you to have a vaccine

01:04:58.190 --> 01:05:05.990
 tested guaranteed and with all groups etc etc etc is more than 4 years and the per

01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:12.710
 that maybe And then I put here the position that the laboratory is so

01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:18.620
 anxious and under their responsibility with the side effects they have not

01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:25.609
 the Total Guarantee of Tests one of the years that lies ahead so

01:05:25.609 --> 01:05:32.430
 are are risks that person being taken by someone in the case of our vaccines

01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:39.569
 manufactured in state institutions which is Fiocruz and Butantã the

01:05:39.569 --> 01:05:45.240
 responsibility and it’s already one of those big of these big the big

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:50.970
 institutions and it all goes through the safety and effectiveness of Uniso and gives us

01:05:50.970 --> 01:05:57.119
 so a degree of security necessary degree of security

01:05:57.119 --> 01:06:07.770
 the film A Ultima there lilou Paulo Figueiredo expected role

01:06:07.770 --> 01:06:12.630
 for the private health network in the application and distribution of vaccines, especially

01:06:12.630 --> 01:06:19.579
 comfortable vaccines do that require special storage conditions

01:06:19.579 --> 01:06:24.270
 it is well it is but we already answered that a little bit and I

01:06:24.270 --> 01:06:32.360
 but I return to name stealing the answer and the moment we fulfill all

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:37.130
 the demands to supply SUS with vaccines to serve the population

01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:43.730
 I believe that we are on this path we need

01:06:43.730 --> 01:06:50.750
 also that the private sector acquires the vaccines directly

01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:57.860
 international laboratories or the surplus of that produced in Brazil and

01:06:57.860 --> 01:07:02.960
 private network also makes it clear that the logistical constraints

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:09.500
 if you work when you talk about the vaccine from phase to phase it is already delivered

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:16.570
 with 30 days with a Styrofoam refrigerator that allows for packaging

01:07:16.570 --> 01:07:20.830
 within the correct temperature for 30 days This is part of the planning

01:07:20.830 --> 01:07:27.050
 Logistic of the amount of vaccines you will take out of your 80 freezer

01:07:27.050 --> 01:07:31.500
 negative degrees o is the quantity x and it will take up to 30 days

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:38.130
 there to be able to handle this Styrofoam it turned out to be very good

01:07:38.130 --> 01:07:44.340
 we are here an hour 7 minutes thanks for the preference is for is us

01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:50.160
 watching winning music here comes from the Patron saint well in that of health and

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:53.670
 served to show you the concern of the work The government

01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:59.370
 federal government has been doing in the fight against inviting From last year until the man

01:07:59.370 --> 01:08:04.530
 we will remain attentive working looking for solutions and calming in the heart

01:08:04.530 --> 01:08:11.670
 listening to those really for some here for some people he is serious can

01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:16.109
 to take the work, people have to take care of themselves until the vaccine is available

01:08:16.109 --> 01:08:20.460
 I hope it works out that it will say whether it will work or not

01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:25.589
 be the experiment the time is right and after the green light from Anvisa that we are

01:08:25.589 --> 01:08:30.759
 responsible expects to return to normal as soon as possible in the most remains

01:08:30.759 --> 01:08:36.250
 only life continues and regrets today that it’s hitting 200 thousand deaths

01:08:36.250 --> 01:08:41.679
 inviting deaths other than inviting deaths we don't have a cut line with respect to

01:08:41.679 --> 01:08:47.980
 But then life continues to be deeply regretted I’m worried about the

01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:52.210
 my mother is 93 years old from Las to contract the virus she will have difficulty until

01:08:52.210 --> 01:08:58.509
 your age but it’s one now we have to get it right it’s no use it’s just

01:08:58.509 --> 01:09:02.859
 continue as some want to continue that old one and go up stay at home

01:09:02.859 --> 01:09:07.719
 what economy to see you later in this will not work this will be chaos in Brazil

01:09:07.719 --> 01:09:13.779
 I can take the conditions even more dramatic than the consequences of the virus

01:09:13.779 --> 01:09:19.059
 we cannot become a country of the poor the countries employed a country without

01:09:19.059 --> 01:09:24.150
 indebted country sack a country as rich as our population is clarified

01:09:24.150 --> 01:09:28.520
 by decisions of some we regret the deaths

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:37.460
 and remains strong and we ask God to bless our Brazil bless the world

01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:42.620
 that after all we are Filler something cooler Give it to the lady

01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:46.819
 say something now you want to say that i just want to know your voice is for

01:09:46.819 --> 01:09:51.770

01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:57.830
 formation virus and bring the cure a hug to everyone Until next Thursday

01:09:57.830 --> 01:10:00.130
