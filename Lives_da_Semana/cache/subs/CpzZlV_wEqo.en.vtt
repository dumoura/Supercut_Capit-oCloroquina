 totally transformed in the 70s and then it was abandoned today is

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.700
 it’s simply impassable, it’s here in the past, even with many bridges

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.690
 were destroyed for the most varied possible reasons other the very

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:12.770
 nature is made because all of it was lost then it is not the collection of a

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.620
 commitment in case of appeal we will do the works that I do not know that

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.970
 imagine if it had about 30 million it is not very close to the budget what I

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.620
 wouldn't do but we don't have this resource until Brazil has to lose a little bit

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.600
 more so we can invest better in the future so open 19

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.300

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:53.080
 to reinforce I can with the public security health post was a problem of

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:58.700

 was the most successful we spent relatively for bi bike on

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:20.300
 relation to these you actually circulated is going to be very successful in five

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:26.540
 elite americans weeks 30 best products on the market as we saved 10

 we hold only one million and we preserve 10 million so go program the subject is go

00:14:54.260 --> 00:15:01.660
 to be stupid on the outside everybody praising and it's ready to be copied

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:07.310
 advanced countries ended up launching programs after brazil we

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:13.190
 expected that approximately 40 million people who would come to the rescue every week

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:18.740
 true in 60 million to thank you mean you had family allowance that

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:25.120
 already had lithic and then the invisible appeared and she 40 million visits

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.769
 in these invisibles there are about 10 million that are really

00:15:28.769 --> 00:15:36.300
 to act used assisted using an example product bones are the

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:40.139
 employers associate with the taxi, I arrived, we were in the fight is the

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:43.980
 person reading a cruet cruet did not pass by personal example to

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:50.850
 inside here at the sewing and the big guys thanked this proposal

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:57.629
 governmental government left all this engineering bureaucracy to pay for the

00:15:57.629 --> 00:16:06.959
 your inscription from the federal fund and from the prisoner our actions ministers of the

00:16:06.959 --> 00:16:13.139
 regional is right there so there was digital inclusion reco never did so fast the

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:18.779
 digitization of 40 best 50 million people then brazil restaurant

00:16:18.779 --> 00:16:26.040
 federal government delivered the Brazilians all and this in a way allowed that

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.780
 there was this social assistance to help

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:33.580
 and Brazilians don't drown in that first wave of health for the mall

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:40.780
 of health that you are now announcing for this but it was of the non

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:52.030
 is set together with in two more months right a big kiss is going to leave for

00:16:52.030 --> 00:17:00.580
 an adequacy will be for sure 340 basically it should be that way

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:08.680
 you should be studying 500 400 300 or to do it then in 12 months is an idea

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:20.070
 very good because it was 600 economy starts to recover people are

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:32.060
 getting used to yours on average 200 when you move to

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:37.640
 500kg inside plus 1:30 family allowance I'm going to move to 400 worth two

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:42.710
 family allowance when it goes to 300 a family allowance and a half is right so this

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:48.200
 here's the idea of ​​exactly met unassisted now economy expects that

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:53.270
 back to work there are things that will take has some differences and was that

00:17:53.270 --> 00:18:00.020
 would do it broke for good closed the door because you did the duty of an answer

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:06.770
 the pertinence of each one who starts to open the market applies to operate the

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:14.000
 we regret their deaths but the goal of closing was so that people a

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:21.610
 contaminated were hospitals attended, we have true news that

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:27.890
 hospitals have leftover milk so it’s not that we want to stay alone if

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:32.970
 my account to discuss this there everybody thinks that

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:37.380
 you know it's right, right, it worked here about seventy percent of

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:43.170
 people will be contaminated store even if the person is under 40 years old well

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:50.480
 health the great Mauritanian will ask for birds who wants to know was committed is to come

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:57.710
 here from my government, which is a good one, I have 70 helena, I have 75 more or less

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:03.060
 he only found out he had a virus because he went to do the time and stayed at home

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:13.130
 doing a treadmill now is according to the age of the other disease

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:27.000
 those days that the glass is in it and this is very special you can die of

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.180
 in everything else and have to be careful you know once a

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:40.290
 dangerous virus and it will be transmitting even the most or

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:46.890
 minus what a person starts to do if I don’t know if I’ve already got both feet behind

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:54.780
 of the negative I don’t know I can protect it again to see if I have the block already

00:19:54.780 --> 00:20:03.809
 I think I already got the profile, you know, of the sanitary life and the channel can be people with the

00:20:03.809 --> 00:20:08.059
 my age that is not well physically shooting the committed video will have a problem

00:20:08.059 --> 00:20:14.559
 have to be careful only that we can’t have almost entrances

00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:25.240
 to chase came to the population and the environment understood an excess is

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:28.960
 concern only one getting started could worry about the other thing was not the

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:35.769
 second wave of the wave of the of the economy that what what happens apparently we

00:20:35.769 --> 00:20:42.039
 we started from rock bottom apparently in May it was together April has already shown a

00:20:42.039 --> 00:20:47.259
 reaction when you look at the electricity bill you look at the electronic invoices

00:20:47.259 --> 00:20:55.419
 public but already recovery in opening and in the triple-des and juniors already go up middle of the

00:20:55.419 --> 00:21:01.600
 burial then June 15th another thing already app is one thing is starting to

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:09.249
 come back and and ours there when your writing emergency aid hits the

00:21:09.249 --> 00:21:14.540
 mark of a triangle I have he does not see the ones that kept the most vulgar

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:19.370
 what is it to just not be dejected I will become a depression

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:24.560
 so if he has signs of afternoon still preserved at any time

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:29.240
 moment when it seems to move, you hit the bottom of the face and you start to

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:33.740
 cross now the interesting thing is that here we have working for that which

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:37.310
 I say that we will suffer my other we approve another sanitation 100 million

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:42.230
 of Brazilians who have problems in the middle of that lack of water for 35

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:47.360
 million people and sewage 100 million Brazilians we approve other

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:52.750
 project sanitation was stopped there was wrong in ours doesn't have much help

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:58.670
 congress so what’s going on we’ve been producing during this period

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:04.280
 agitated only by the Americans or facing only the disease we also have an agenda

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:08.930
 positive and now we go the males and four and then see the problem of

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:13.310
 job also see novel avenida brasil is full of news for

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:19.080
 bring has the gps the fgts we will release when

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:26.100
 triggered second and we will also release the fgts is just a clinics are

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:32.940
 biological thirties only 60 60 million people also talk

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:37.110
 talk Monday so what we could do present the point of view

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:42.460
 of resources in two times more and then

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:48.190
 is that your idea of ​​not leaving any Brazilian for costume cannot be missing

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:54.160
 money for health and the thrift store show we spend twice as much as the

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:59.980
 emerging countries and 10 percent above the average of the forwards so brazil

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:04.090
 no one can say that brazil didn’t look to know anything about help

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:08.560
 states and municipalities two opportunities the more or less and that

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:13.210
 way was that 150 million bailout when the conversation started considered the

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:17.049
 first visit they made is we had already released releasing 50

00:23:17.049 --> 00:23:24.159
 and what we did 8002 fund-to-fund transfer is the following money in

00:23:24.159 --> 00:23:28.960
 vein for health the national health fund has spent 8 brilliant for states and

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:36.360
 municipalities soon after two billion for the single social assistance system

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:43.149
 are things like the holy house of mercy these hospitals in are

00:23:43.149 --> 00:23:48.429
 kept in the advertisements without time for you only spent two million more after

00:23:48.429 --> 00:23:53.559
 we spent over 16 million the municipalities states and madam our collection

00:23:53.559 --> 00:23:58.649
 time will fall for the kalita federal government but even so we kept the same

00:23:58.649 --> 00:24:03.009
 transfer for example from last year with commitment that I took on governors

00:24:03.009 --> 00:24:08.859
 by three independent so independent of the governor's party all every

00:24:08.859 --> 00:24:14.389
 operators all and soon after another 20 million

00:24:14.389 --> 00:24:19.980
 securitization was a resource that they could release and then interest rollover

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:26.279
 say in the end the thing 60 million more books than us because it also has

00:24:26.279 --> 00:24:30.120
 problem if urban transportation you need to keep transportation running

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.870
 urban someone can use ok everyone in their daughter social and distance

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:37.409
 suddenly someone needs to get a lot this big I go to the hospital

00:24:37.409 --> 00:24:41.249
 anything you need to have transportation now in the same school way

00:24:41.249 --> 00:24:45.210
 have the option of something that belonged to the school that suddenly the schools

00:24:45.210 --> 00:24:48.570
 children go home and pre-chocolate so you need it too

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:54.450
 keeps working sends 60 more times when its distinctive mode goes 150

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:59.220
 billion for united states and there has never been so much money for united states and for

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:03.389
 what I didn’t even preserve it continues to work despite sales

00:25:03.389 --> 00:25:09.360
 fell while just following it had a sugar saf at the same time the part of

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:13.059
 transporting to tarcísio lake is guaranteed super easy

00:25:13.059 --> 00:25:17.950
 for the country man did not stop did not stop stopped cooked American and hit

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:24.100
 compared to last year's harvest and Brazil is the only country increasing its

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:28.539
 exports what as our man kept working on exports

00:25:28.539 --> 00:25:34.500
 mainly agricultural products in vera also flow is also

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:39.309
 agriculture and also minerals so Brazilian exports continue

00:25:39.309 --> 00:25:44.409
 rising is a shock that came from outside Brazil ended up not coming because the quotes

00:25:44.409 --> 00:25:48.389
 keep turning so i think brazil is in a position to surprise me

00:25:48.389 --> 00:25:53.649
 going out and seeing what we said, that cart hits the bottom and starts to

00:25:53.649 --> 00:26:00.100
 true also so we have us we are really in a condition and they would come back

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:06.509
 economic recovery before even other countries even

00:26:06.509 --> 00:26:16.199
 it’s early tomorrow morning for ceara that we’re going to move from I’ve had it’s going

00:26:16.199 --> 00:26:19.709
 inaugurate together with the marine rogério that our minister of development

00:26:19.709 --> 00:26:25.349
 water arriving in Ceará will not be able to cross the São Francisco River

00:26:25.349 --> 00:26:29.549
 people talk about the work started behind printer behind but hatred via decision

00:26:29.549 --> 00:26:35.249
 government not to leave no standing water which is very common at present I assume he

00:26:35.249 --> 00:26:40.979
 forget everything that has been done and do your works we know it's our commitment no

00:26:40.979 --> 00:26:45.539
 leave work stopped then tomorrow we will be together with the rogério

00:26:45.539 --> 00:26:50.639
 our marine at the beginning of the regional canal of rio grande do norte inaugurating

00:26:50.639 --> 00:26:57.089
 this section invites me again the governors of ceara and pernambuco to

00:26:57.089 --> 00:27:01.289
 to show up with the face not or at least airport we can hit a

00:27:01.289 --> 00:27:05.729
 chatting with the woman are opposition governors but our government doesn’t have the

00:27:05.729 --> 00:27:10.090
 position she and let's go clean water clean water clean in

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:14.679
 all the senses how clean water is coming and the northeastern people deserve it

00:27:14.679 --> 00:27:19.330
 all the contraction all the respect my father-in-law is even from ceara and

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:27.340
 crateús then in ceará tomorrow paulo something else here is the Selic rate lowered me

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:38.170
 I already drew you imagined back there regulatory tensions project that Brazil had

00:27:38.170 --> 00:28:10.660
 very high heaven and hell and it’s also what we’ve changed instead of staying with the

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:16.460
 government spending a lot and the chosen private sector we did show we

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:21.590
 we did the poison has skill is doing what it takes takes water

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:27.140
 clean or do the things that are important but not spending on the

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:32.000
 access to the pension reform present we ended up building east right

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.020
 likewise the employee salary were marketing audio insured a

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:42.290
 a little bit just a little while and Brazil starts to have resources to

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:47.330
 invest so this is happening this is happening just because

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:53.060
 hole here on facebook we need to have 79 thousand people online at

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:58.140
 youtube 35000 o pingo doce your 88 thousand congratulations to

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:04.529
 our front young pan news 16,000 people from pingo doce that that I

00:29:04.529 --> 00:29:09.870
 zé maria people help king sobral who uses augusto use 12 other you

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:16.529
 need the name of gabriel right these four there thank you for you have

00:29:16.529 --> 00:29:20.340
 to have a link here to see if you are going to ask him here for me not the

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:28.200
 paulo guedes with this down below in the case compared to last year as

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:32.100
 of interest we must pay less occurring more or less for example we are

00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:39.720
 lowering the initial calculations 120 to 240 million some as it is going down

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:43.440
 be more than that are a fair resource seeing that what happened to the

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:48.000
 brazil brazil spends a lot and spends badly already had the privilege of

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:54.970
 social security spent paying interest for wholesale cat

00:29:54.970 --> 00:30:00.850
 the first 500 million a day is already the cool force you’re really paying

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:06.190
 exactly because the government is now spending the same it is spending better for

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:10.480
 example is only taking clean water there until taking water there and compensation

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:16.809
 all paying less expenses together is the same way is also the accesses that

00:30:16.809 --> 00:30:20.740
 had the presidency of some privilege but we will sacrifice future generations

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:25.360
 to maintain privileges so we also reduced skrillex i'm not doing the

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:31.090
 austere government he spends less one with the better quality that is

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:34.919
 happening on all arrows and then completed a year and a half without showing

00:30:34.919 --> 00:30:39.460
 all sides all peace companies best groan from the presidential courier

00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:44.049
 gives the economy box much better to petrobras and he took it all

00:30:44.049 --> 00:30:49.779
 working better now we have to turn this into a resource

00:30:49.779 --> 00:30:53.529
 to get to the station, get to the tip, I'm not, said Pedro, how's it going?

00:30:53.529 --> 00:31:00.149
 fruit that is the overdraft of the box and two percent 2009 two three per

00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:07.440
 percent was percent is that I swear from the overdraft this 14 per

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:13.070
 percent hold on to month 4 and now three percent a month there is a

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:22.370
 huge logical difference that you will want that no one stays there

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:29.360
 and the last reminder because it changed in relation to 2018 I will take this work

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:34.880
 another its higher or decreased move to 2 half percent to half crazy percent

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:40.040

 lambari bridge people were going to graduate for next 2014 remember this

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:42.790
 I was there, a deputy receives him, okay, right, a very big vote, almost that one

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:48.460
 business and I went to that stop there the subscribers are ok and I said I was going to risk

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:53.970
 my life more running for the presidency and 2018 but hey there’s only one ticket

00:33:53.970 --> 00:34:01.540
 fantastic even for everyone I was in Cuiabá in Mato Grosso and I arrived for

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:04.990

 photographs does not appear in 2017 and leaves a guy down here

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:22.549
 is the x-everything she he was a receptionist were was a cook is the waiter was

00:34:22.549 --> 00:34:28.210
 all right I want poor humble music to earn maybe 12 minimum wages a month

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:33.770
 and I thought, pull a glass with him to see him with his whole life telling the

00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:37.730
 mine and at the time I said he was a candidate will present everything he gave

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:42.580
 laughter because his hotel what is humble I cannot speak to the

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:46.960
 money you’ll talk about, right? But it’s humble, the stove is sure that the

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:53.500
 people usually talk about the joke and the daily rates that are $ 120 can pay the pocket

00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:59.840
 of us, right, his life laughed, I'm here only

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:03.890
 the deputy who was generally made public by the presidency that one

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:09.860
 wonderful right and then I told him that you think it’s more difficult for me to get to

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:14.450
 presidency and you in a hurry I'm here much more difficult lyrics is to get to

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:18.650
 presidency I arrived I hope it is working to buy hotel this I

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:24.950
 respectfully covers accuracy that each bury if they present the question of the

00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:30.100
 some strive question is good luck

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:41.280
 then it is once you can achieve your goal is

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:48.150
 is what was it to open my mouth? I'm going to put it here for us, look there, minister

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:56.450
 paulo guedes it is possible to calculate the drop in this year's gdp calculate it is already possible

00:35:56.450 --> 00:36:03.750
 pleasure to talk to you because you who announced you announced that the president

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:09.540
 bolsonaro i had invited me to minister i remember that right i'm here for you

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:16.170
 should the visit there for people to talk that I’m so I don’t even know how to give

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:23.400
 interview but I do not believe the the economy a living organism the same

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:29.120
 way that it is very difficult to predict the effect on the particular organism

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:44.230
 some to all parameters the models stop

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:48.610
 to work when you have a shock with illness I don't believe in the predictions

00:36:48.610 --> 00:36:53.170
 that are made because if we are living organisms but it is us for

00:36:53.170 --> 00:37:00.490
 example if the disease gets quickly we start to work you want we can

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:05.050
 get all the example today today I found out for example but

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:08.830
 accompanying the daily electricity bills that is happening samsung's

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:15.280
 energy today we only have four percent below the same 20 days of June

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:19.570
 from last year so today we playing your four you pick up for energy

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:22.960
 eletrobras other than us only four are you everyone talking to you will

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:27.540
 drop this today we have to drop four compared to the same month last year

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:33.010
 so when a shock like that all the models used the forecast fails

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:36.820
 because I'm going to change what we call a regime change or a change

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:40.650
 dramatic but there are people who never happened nobody knows the answer

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:47.039
 and nobody knows the ones there so people started kicking -1 -2 -4 minus ten to

00:37:47.039 --> 00:37:51.750
 prediction of that for example is less us i think they will go wrong i think

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:58.410
 knowledge, because this, this, this forecast is that they do there even the

00:37:58.410 --> 00:38:02.789
 girl that this prediction do not want to like the female staff very cool but the girl

00:38:02.789 --> 00:38:06.690
 of the color is that it is strange of the strength come here to talk to me I didn't know anything

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:11.640
 from brazil i kill this half hour an hour left here bottle - 9 i think she

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:16.049
 it will pass the squeeze there at the end of the year pass the forecast that it closes but

00:38:16.049 --> 00:38:20.339
 let's see also I won't say it's wrong it's not right she says it's not

00:38:20.339 --> 00:38:25.230
 it is possible to make a forecast like this at the moment like this and it depends on many people

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:29.039
 why the gift goes soon let's go let's go to work at some point

00:38:29.039 --> 00:38:33.270

 years is depression is guaranteed depression carried out at home to stop for others

 said play has two hours the first of the waters hit the after economy line

00:38:54.760 --> 00:39:00.339
 called attention to that to take care stay everyone stop there will have the

00:39:00.339 --> 00:39:04.780
 money that we inject has another connection there circulating but shelf

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:08.770
 vasinhos get everybody connected even though the people in the field just

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:14.020
 how to have expensive natural social distance in the field is in the remaining foot field

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:19.150
 of bone they maintained production and they are saving Brazil you do the

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:24.549
 right, there are some states that were banned and on the beach now the ms says that the sun does

00:39:24.549 --> 00:39:30.220
 well polishing there to transform vitamin d how much thing

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:35.080
 wrong was done during when it was something just curiosity right how much is side

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:39.010
 from the outside whether ill will or misinformation everything for us is

00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:43.930
 potentialized in a negative way I received the two weeks credentials of

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:48.940
 three new ambassadors in brazil an ambassador from france and she is like that

00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:53.700
 environmental issue her curriculum was with Minister Ernesto Araujo

00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:59.410
 in addition to the insurance relationship and he volunteered for her to travel to

00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:02.890
 amazon region when it says that it is on fire amazon force plane

00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:07.000
 aerial a goddess of the presidency of the republic how about the amazons where she

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.140
 want to go to show two currents taking people from the press, right to

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:16.120
 show the reality of what happens in brazil by nobody nobody preserves

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:19.810
 so much environment with us over sixty percent of the territory victory

00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:23.200
 is it is a form of another out there that he

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:29.080
 find a span of riparian forest ok I by the rivers now we pay a

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:33.820
 very high price with respect to izé the other pass had an average focus

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:38.680
 I don't know what is lower than in recent years and even so it was boosted

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:44.290
 as if I had set fire to the stable in the Amazon region, it’s like pain

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:50.700
 even one more question for roseli zé maria 04 speaks samaria

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:57.560
 the president is good that good

00:40:57.750 --> 00:41:04.290
 and they are working hours and consequent wage reduction and also defined that the

00:41:04.290 --> 00:41:09.000
 powers will keep the budget independent of google fundraising as

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.310
 is that this will be reflected in the public coffers I have been talking to our

00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:21.900
 respect this video is the public opinion in general thinks that at the time of

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:26.880
 sacrifice is always done it has to be shared so public opinion is

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:32.610
 thinks it is natural in the same way as the private sector to drop the wages of

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:37.980
 just as there are people who lose their jobs since the top also gave a

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:42.390
 contribution i talking this to president we're talking about

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:49.170
 exactly that the prudent president is held the salary you put that year

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:53.790
 that comes your gift did not want to achieve my acquired right reduce

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:57.760
 nobody's salary but got it right that there was a share

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:03.610
 hi people asking for a salary increase jesus governor asking for resources and wanting

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:09.040
 using this feature maybe some form of the 90's election year, so what do we

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:13.660
 we did that the government did in the president called the governors were present

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:20.350
 of the screen is the president is sedated and we made an agreement whereby the resources

00:42:20.350 --> 00:42:23.980
 will be rendered 15 will have to go to health can not turn a doctor talk

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:29.500
 precisely to show the public opinion and also the employees that I

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:34.120
 break badly at that time or employee who complained about it is the same because the

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:39.160
 public opinion is asking more the question in fact it is saying

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:43.750
 next why doesn't it run is that the supreme is not wrong to keep the

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:47.670
 hourly wages everyone is losing so that's why I found

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:51.910
 moderate attitude of the president there are people asking that it was 20 people from her

00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:56.740
 disagree people ask for strong 25 right to show that they were participating in the

00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:00.710
 sacrifice with hi people wanting that in a rabbit there he

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:04.910
 cruiser million a lot of things that I said was there from the medals

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:08.900
 after the war the war is starting now we are going to give sale medal to

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:13.310
 everyone so president a very thoughtful line said everything is not even have these

00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:16.760
 increases but there is also no drop we will keep this salary there for two

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:57.750
 years only zé maria that i understood i think better that you use a

00:43:57.750 --> 00:44:03.540
 I’m going to surprise you, now you’ve said that there can neither be reduced nor

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:09.570
 that's what public opinion is, I think it's unfavorable to

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:14.580
 this variation is on the other hand, they think because the institutional mind

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:18.510
 are being a right side that comes to say this i will answer more

00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:24.360
 question is then what happens the other day you don’t get money into the

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:30.960
 water tank how do you want to get more water out of it if we get your kiss

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:35.850
 it's six months and an hour and a half more prepared in a little while you don't even pay

00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:44.510
 salary I will do you can decree whatever you want will only have another question that uses

00:44:56.750 --> 00:45:00.760
 tax and for a long time how is it going to be

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:05.950
 resumption of that agenda that changes in the gnv fox are being made and in the next

00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:13.450
 months to return to this essential agenda of the country right now I'm going to

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:55.350
 need an hour a special problem also before so we started to

00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:59.930
 bad is the and foresight privileges to

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:05.720
 pension plan I swear to fat cats that people who sell young income still and

00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:10.869
 at the same time is the salary of friend works that was very high went up

00:46:10.869 --> 00:46:16.880
 fifty percent above inflation 17 years means it became a caste in

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:20.720
 compared to the rest of Brazil and when the coronavirus comes to a draw in the economy

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:24.920
 this meteorite sharpens that difference everybody now see the

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:29.960
 next to job stability beyond the privileges of social security not

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:34.010
 he also suffers that he was on a salary and did not participate in the general sacrifice then

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:39.020
 this is public opinion this is it we did what threads we have this agenda

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:44.270
 of reforms we had to deviate from structural reforms we had to

00:46:44.270 --> 00:46:48.710
 deviate to emergency measures now so they end up announcing the measures

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:53.300
 emergency chairman will now expand the body there we had three months to

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:57.750
 600 now let's go another three months down right 500/400

00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:04.020
 hi and then we go back to our reform program we already did the sanitation let's go

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:09.630
 now do the sharing of the starting for the oil concession we will make the gas

00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:14.790
 natural we are going to do the electro sector we are going to unlock the country's investments

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:19.740
 because the federal pact's priority time has changed a little bit like you

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:23.250
 said it was a naive to give money to lend municipality that

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:27.420
 year you call already much more than he will already receive to have an idea

00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:33.000
 we made a transfer there in a few months we have 50 percent that

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.400
 the family allowance has paid since 2004 us in a few months owes fifty percent of the

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:43.020
 that gave him long years because it was this calamity that hit us I didn’t

00:47:43.020 --> 00:47:48.270
 I'm bad means of emergency aid 50 is worth more than the verb to have the

00:47:48.270 --> 00:47:53.340
 launch of the whole year without the right, the whole year family allowance is 50

00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:57.760
 million when it happens we are at 150 million a month only

00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:03.490
 well then the priority as you asked which priority has now changed

00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:08.800
 slightly priority now is employment and income recovery of the economy so

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:13.030
 employment and income so we now have a yellow green problem to create there

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:17.500
 the universe work some invisible I found a 30 million Brazilians have

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:21.340
 current invisible Brazilian women who never asked for anything from the state they

00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:25.450
 want the right to make a living on their own so today we're going to

00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:30.220
 create a ramp of social ascension these people have to go through can be employed

00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:35.740
 entering with the babi without any of that, which is not, is not a legislation that values

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:39.910
 to end mass unemployment so let's submit only a brief congress

00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:45.670
 tooth is the priority now job creation we just need to open

00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:49.600
 new investment horizons so seeing investment and natural gas shock

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:53.650
 cheap energy will arrive in the gas cylinder in a little while it will be cheap let's go

00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:57.740
 do after tax reform we will reduce the different we will also

00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:03.350
 and the basic public basket accessible to the population to buy stoves

00:49:03.350 --> 00:49:08.510
 refrigerator without removing the risks of using the price to use so we go there we go

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:12.110
 resume our reform agenda look for tax reform landmark

00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:16.070
 regulation of investments job creation with exemption from payroll

00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:20.570
 payment we will leave for five Brazil will be surprised the world the year

00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:23.660
 spent on surprisingly doing pension reform when no one

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:28.700
 I thought it was possible this year for us during the academy both the congress is

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:32.150
 working ok everybody there working approved the sanitation yesterday to prove the

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:36.770
 driver's license I mean they'll surprise you so let's surprise you

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:41.030
 Brazil is going to see a brave people. We will stick to two o'clock. We will leave the

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:45.080
 side there paulo this allows here the last question to her the victor grade of the young woman

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:51.210
 pan pingo nos is the minister good night to businessmen there

00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:56.760
 who have complained about the difficulty of accessing the credit lines that were

00:49:56.760 --> 00:50:00.150
 announced by the federal government businessmen are having difficulties in

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:05.070
 get that money to keep the doors open in relation to that what the

00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:08.760
 situation minister there was in fact some problem to release that money and

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:14.220
 what is the forecast when this will be solved the truth there was the problem

00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:19.380
 Thus, our credit problems had an unsatisfactory performance.

00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:24.390
 best team are the closest guys but their little gas is the group alive

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:29.040
 it is precisely this group is the pezula of the cashier is the corner of the central bank is ruben

00:50:29.040 --> 00:50:34.140
 normal in the bank of brazil is omotesando the baby is great now sometimes it is like that

00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:38.910
 what maximum then I see that it touches the ball the ball ends it makes the curve another ti in that

00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:43.640
 scoring a goal the ball goes in the opposite direction we had a satisfactory performance in

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:48.220
 beginning if viruses improving so much that I counted the others first

00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:53.859
 the social forum of the law what they like concerts at a cost don't let go

00:50:53.859 --> 00:50:58.510
 the payroll started to work but there is black, it was not satisfactory there

00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:04.060
 we created the other spectacular program the first time that the federal revenue miga

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:10.570
 public entrepreneurs we took 3200000 small entrepreneurs who pay tax

00:51:10.570 --> 00:51:15.460
 good payers of simple crochet and was complaining that the money didn't arrive

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:19.599
 it's getting to the top receiving a call from the federal revenue federal revenue league

00:51:19.599 --> 00:51:23.260
 for the guy to talk about becoming a taxpayer you can stop by and pick up

00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:27.790
 thirty percent of your monthly billing that we spend at the cashier picks up the

00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:33.130
 money paid in the bank of brazil that takes this improving the reach 200 already

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:39.760
 they got in there because it’s then we’re improving the

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:44.980
 full time but I agree saw the social performance was unsatisfactory and

00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:48.609
 Real Madrid came on the pitch I'm Barcelona on the pitch, our lose to the

00:51:48.609 --> 00:51:54.490
 Brazil from 2 to 0 trying to turn the tide is that we didn't say botafogo then we turned
