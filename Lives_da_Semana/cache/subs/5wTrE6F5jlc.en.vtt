00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.960
 case ours he was 63 years old of the culture sure he with 62 he was in

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.630

 healed who recognizes age was healed I didn't even ask him if he took

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.520
 took an azithromycin thing and seeing mectin here didn’t take that now

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.490
 so there are other things and then it works right, even though it doesn’t have the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.049
 scientific proof could also be that it made a coincidence with my case

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.190
 it seems like a coincidence I took the two chains but the people who have

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.980
 taken at the very beginning of the symptoms is has been successful the treatment he had

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:24.810
 everything right for that group at extreme risk due to his age he has 100 right

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.390
 100 years so he had everything to be here in the really high risk group in

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:38.690
 total then took took azithromycin that will live medicine killed the bixa all right

 animals that depend on it decree establishing the national coordination of

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.180
 animal protection and defense in the ministry of the environment is a federal agency for

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.880
 public policies, right, that fights for the welfare of animals and fights

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.470
 mistreatment of domestic animals, squeeze birds too and we see that it is because of

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.519
 first time in government is concerned with animals so she formulates

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.580
 public policy policies for and will not have the days that animal not that

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.000
 not before it was the tip of the line more municipalities which state is very to be

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.360
 municipality that at the end of the line is really hands on so this one

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.840
 coordination is available to anyone who wants to smoke there ideas change project or create

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.340
 new bill to defend animals these people coordinate it all

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.660
 send it to us contact the state and municipal secretariats to

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.410
 address this issue and it shows the concern that we have to talk about

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.340
 animal here I will put here animal abuse I am an animal in a bad way is

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.280
 the truth is that there is no point in mistreating the radio but we are either homemade or

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.760
 I don't know whether it is from the month of the month so if the ordinance is very welcome you participated

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.750
 of the elaboration of the hands collaboration was made with the personnel of the ministry of

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.800
 environment with the beginning it revoked under total in the parade is not what today folks

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.759
 we presented here together with tarcísio saw the bill of the near

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:24.020
 of the sea and is about coastal shipping

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.670
 the types of navigation in Brazil are not complicated yet the idea of ​​lia is

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.450
 reducing bureaucracy and empowering is not to encourage the use of navigation

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.990
 cabotage inland navigation before at the port and another one I can more

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.980
 next to each other is not long-haul navigation so this issue here

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.750
 we understand that it will help a lot here ah ah the transport of material to see

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.850
 if you guys are also here in Brazil so I know how to talk to the boys

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.510
 seeking to reduce bureaucracy does not interfere with the lives of those who want to produce

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.880
 who wants to work because apparently it will have to take the state beyond

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:09.090
 largely equipped the bureaucratized state I watched difficulty to

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.080
 if you do anything not the same wind, it’s going to get better

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.860
 more still need to make a small hydroelectric power plant was a birth is a

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.139
 duck here again, right, it's not easy are you

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:25.060
 on something in brazil work being done incessantly the tarcísio meu're

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.129
 studying for more than a month the collection of facilitating not its qualification for a

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:36.460
 pilot license renewal has got to do proof outside of brazil

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.169
 to receive compliments, renew the license to be buried, ok people are going to get a

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:46.150
 tarciso way to resolve this matter another thing you also to do a

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.949
 hotel a beach needs more than 200 licenses is me practically unworkable

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:55.409
 state license municipal license federal license all with convergence of

00:06:55.409 --> 00:07:02.169
 competence so we can make this more flexible, make it easier to

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:05.379
 generation of jobs and income that was fundamental in this government I had in

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:08.830
 belém do pará today is more attention in the 15 days ago to have with

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:15.460
 I need the construction of a xingu apostle there in the stop the test of speaking if it gives

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.150
 all right we take eight months but the environmental study and license

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:26.060
 hello everything is fine but on average to take a year it will be less bureaucratic to do a

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.410
 bridge in the place that already has a ferry that I take there so things are not

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:37.780
 easy in brazil then the weight of brazil is right the weight of brazil is huge for you

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:44.150
 to be able to move the wealth here to earn their money to work so many

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:50.090
 measurements being made we can send the idea to us I see

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:56.390
 women one deals on average each post on facebook 213 sometimes has good ideas

00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:00.710
 then I pass the respective minister to say if it is possible not to do that

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:05.420
 here to meet that black of that person the correction of the xingu posture the same

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:11.450
 thing I didn't speak to tarcísio and did a study quickly right the flow of

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:16.100
 trucks which transported the difficulties how much time more than

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.820
 lived there for the cargo truck needs to move from side to side on

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.250
 Mayan hi and we’re going to get along with this

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:28.170
 bridge time if I don’t know the right here right but I’m going to kick here I wouldn’t be mad

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:32.880
 at least three hours in this traffic there the president when we were in

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.050
 bahia last year at the end of the year we went to port i forgot the name of

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:41.760
 I put it there with Admiral Autran and we're going back to the codeba, it's in the codeba and the

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:46.920
 the flow of production from bahia due to an environmental issue was stagnant and the

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:51.570
 anthem product for são paulo with the port at the door so you entered the field

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:56.220
 and we unlocked that port how many millions did brazil lose by sending the

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.450
 production for são paulo inside bahia send to her we also changed

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:06.180
 it is not takes I had there in the port of aratu it was on the occasion of the new year christmas

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:11.310
 you stopped by then I don't know how to stand still, you must stay four days

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:17.100
 two went there one more of the days I went in deborah color and I looked there and decided there

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.140
 make a change in the presidency and board

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:25.510
 the admiral autran and started to work better the opposite because like us

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:29.260
 we changed the director of the post of yours has about four five months and in this last one

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.670
 month that so beat the rank here grain export proposed in saints the

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:37.390
 porto de santos the past with the little pictures that kind of news you

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:41.560
 you know why I'm talking here, you know, it changed that, it doesn't mean that everything is

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.730
 right not seeing if there is something wrong a little at the airport get the

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:51.790
 superintendent the federal highway police post is the collection of the

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:56.590
 personnel that you will take out the ace personnel was crossed from the army already you have

00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:00.610
 any problem in goiânia got in touch with me fernando we solved the

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:07.700
 knowing the air was not ill will the military's ill will this issue

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.990
 of the pêga documentation of the cars is that there is a court decision that you do not

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:15.140
 could schedule more on the internet where you personally have to start queuing

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:20.990
 pandemic in the queue increases even more because the staff of the

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:26.180
 army is committed the virus stays at home it's worth it but you come to the question

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:30.230
 worth it is worth a meter present it was all set I will repeat here

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:34.550
 exchange the pacóvios all trucks in brazil are almost 2 million among

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:39.440
 trucks and vehicles that in this one were mandatory of the cup and to be

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.850
 exchanged 1900 for each person we ended this also wanted to put the

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:48.200
 taximeters thing in the taxi has a rich guy amanda right I was being

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:52.550
 observed from the entrance of the event, I got controlled with a fever, right, because my colleague

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:59.420
 formed by ine replied that the new taxi who will enter this life of

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:04.920
 taxi driver the new ones in the files the text taxis promoting new cars

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:09.720
 I am no longer a new model and I don’t have to change it. Everyone also has a

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:13.920
 little problem of wanted to go there in the meter there put a chip in each pump

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:17.910
 of fuel from brazil i don't know the price and cost it there in what to pay you

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:21.470
 at the end of us we go out knowing that the very high fuel will cause

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:26.400
 taxes and between the monopoly among other things there

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:32.850
 and this question about br do marcos coming back here the subject is to reduce bureaucratization we know

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:38.970
 the issue of the flag problem of the crew's problem, right, but the

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:44.670
 problem putting this thing up is with increasing competition decreases the

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:49.530
 weight the freight price also decreases everything improves the Brazilian the Senate in the

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:54.450
 yesterday approved there outside of Chile approved yesterday something he

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:59.880
 Brazil starts in Chile, right, we’re here the week our part is also more

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:04.800
 a business partner and special conditions here soon we will have here

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:09.680
 in the case here in south america hi how's that question of

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:14.240
 sinking ships there on the coast of the sea has stopped the pandemic or continues for

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:18.490
 above did not give the floor because of the pandemic right I already have two to

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:22.250
 inaugurate now from september that are already sunk there in pernambuco even

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:26.360
 that it was pernambuco you go like this not that you need to be able to it already

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:31.250
 saw that ship was already providing pernambuco no not because the water did not

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:35.450
 need is serious even know that pernambuco has the vocation for shipwreck

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:42.530
 today pernambuco already has more than 90 in the race we have no more than 90 shipwreck in

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:47.240
 reef for contemplation diving has fernando noronha in short it is a

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:51.800
 program that will make Brazil the main country in the world and

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.520
 plunge that an activity that generates jobs and own income the supply chain

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.550
 diver tourism when he arrives at the corner he spends at least ten days

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:02.330
 because he can only dive two days after he arrives he comes by plane and only

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.780
 can get on the plane again I wanted to place an order for you want to order

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:11.400
 will be the one if you want a selfie here and I have a house in lúcio costa in

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:18.690

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:35.700
 it would be good for you no longer a compatible distance also see the

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:39.930
 depth in my understanding I will kick here the ideal for my wedding

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:44.490
 right no more than 10 - 1 unit to help that same hiring would be

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:48.960
 good to sink the ship in front of these hotels for sure what is the advantage for the

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:54.360
 tourism for the hotel chain certainly the shipwreck he in addition to adding fauna

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:59.370
 marine for sport fishing for contemplation diving to study the

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:05.910
 cast of federal universities of maritime biology he and the plunge of

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:10.750
 contemplation it generates and for the entire productive chain and we have already

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:15.790
 has president more than 120 points approved by the navy today that

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:21.640

 train we have now we are getting a donation of sculptures to make a

00:14:43.089 --> 00:14:47.410
 marine sculpture park understood so that's it over there in the field

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:52.360
 has a salt that is the museum of several marine sculptures that receive more than

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:56.860
 a million people a year if he said that with losing approximately

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:02.610
 how much the annual billing in cancún runs more or less then with the manual

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:08.000
 and runs around a hundred and only salt museums 150

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.420
 it's just a museum next to you a lot of money allotment and that 500 there from all over the world

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:18.680
 via straight tourism now you have had cancun not yet I didn’t have father

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.870
 now but unfortunately you already had money now in a little while

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:29.060
 we had time let's see the present that is far superior to cancún and has a detail

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:34.040
 there is no hurricane and there is no seaweed you have the shark there also has an outlet for

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:39.860
 he doesn’t have normal diving anymore I’ve seen the baron of mauá stole only attacks

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:46.340
 if he has the shark on an empty stomach and he doesn’t eat the person using you

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.220
 don't talk when I'm unbalanced to myself I don't want to talk one more time

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:55.490
 time it depends on parliament a lot is I have worked to talk to

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:59.510
 a lot of people here in the senate to see if we can revoke a

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:04.430
 environmental decree to repeal environmental decree has to be a project that calls

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:08.010
 law is not absurd it will not put there

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:15.000
 this is activism is environmental activism okay your [ __ ] already because everything

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.260
 I want to say that I am not even aware of mine

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:25.770
 an environmental decree that in 29 geographic accidents there within a radius of 1 km you

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:29.730
 can do anything if you are dying i don't go so she goes wash for the

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:34.110
 offshore it clears a kilometer that you the people go down gave me you have there

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:38.220
 you're going to have a problem like I had in the past, let's go, a ghost problem

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:41.760
 because I was in Brazil and setting it up as if I had it there is no problem

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:46.650
 right, this matter is already resolved, I’m going to president, but we want to create in

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:50.160
 bay of angra and a big pole everything that has money and outside of brazil with

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:53.360
 sure I need private money and the tourist it does not degrade the environment

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.990
 on the contrary, each tourist is an environmental inspector because he only comes back if

00:16:57.990 --> 00:17:01.500
 he dives to find the fish he only goes back in the wetland if he gets there

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.370
 find anaconda to take the picture the jaguar the bird if it finds plastic

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:07.990
 on the beach he doesn't come back then and today with his brother

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:13.120
 tripadvisor e-book etc you see the note on the site if there is down it does not

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:17.110
 then I return each tourist a inspector from the same I'm here with a resolution of the

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:24.959
 anvisa 405 at the end of last month ah sure there was an exception to

00:17:24.959 --> 00:17:30.150
 controlled prescription for the purchase of hydroxyzine ivermectin within a

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:34.710
 confusion little by little right you know why you need to buy this one

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:39.030
 needed the medical prescription which principle the medical prescription needs

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:46.730
 because the red stripe that was created at that time to avoid buying

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:51.770
 and to do business to resell I make stock at home as if I miss

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:56.330
 then I think it doesn’t even warn you of making a decision that needed a sea of

00:17:56.330 --> 00:18:03.049
 double recipe come with retention retention ok so that's it changed now no need

00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:08.030
 more you will need the prescription because it is written here

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:15.020
 some taboos criticizing that the president sent the laboratory the army

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:19.760
 kim to beat the army to manufacture pills then with the reserve of 4

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.419
 millions of pills is more or less what the theme is right, not only the army

00:18:23.419 --> 00:18:29.730
 adding another one that stocks here in Brazil if each person takes half a dozen

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:33.840
 yeah i know it was your mom i talked to the doctor half a dozen pills one

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:39.990
 franchise at 4 million for half a dozen sense me i'm going to kick here 67,000 today

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:47.490
 it can be 180 thousand doses now our annual consumption of routine eduarda for

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:55.470
 malaria for lupus and what more mariah lupus rheumatoid arthritis in store 1

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:59.700
 million in length is 13 million pills a year so there's nothing

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:04.920
 will be thrown away despite being a kind of a very cheap medicine so

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.030
 everything will take advantage of one way or another have another study arrived here

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:16.230
 the major that this does not forget all this is hi cal friston

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:21.169
 and just released my social media is a person I have already reached the bridge

00:19:21.169 --> 00:19:27.270
 it is impossible it is not fake news it is not for us to disclose that one more person

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:32.160
 enabled is disk eighty percent of people will not feel anything zero nothing

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:37.260
 you won't even want a little flu, nothing's right, I know, I talked to my car

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:41.419
 case for my physical understanding for my past life that I have to

00:19:41.419 --> 00:19:46.650
 sportsman like you took care I'm not sedentary if I was committed no

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:52.919
 feel absolutely nothing this was true ok the president of the

00:19:52.919 --> 00:19:58.230
 my case I felt nothing nothing felt nothing you put me on when I

00:19:58.230 --> 00:20:03.240
 I knew the result and I didn't feel anything and I paid the price for the negative you put me on

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:08.860
 central pool is the time will say huh and then medicine we have here I saw it

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:13.660
 is a TV journalist from Bandeirantes these days I even put on my part of the

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:17.230
 stove then I called him I talked to him chatting he says the story

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:21.640
 that several mayors from the south are now behind europe here we here

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.160
 that I'm going to ask you for us here for us not for me it wasn't for health

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:36.100
 mayor of jacupiranga vale do ribeira registration also asked for the piece i

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:40.360
 I’m reading and there’s also a war shot coming out there to stay in Eldorado garden

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:45.669
 my region my prices are asking when it comes to

00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:49.419
 where he walks to the ministry of health they do analysis according to the

00:20:49.419 --> 00:20:54.460
 number of projectors orders except é e homo free of charge for secretaries

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:59.230
 municipal health authorities, of course, you can see this request for the mayor's

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:03.370
 mayor is not the mayor who decides who decides the doctor is not a decree

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:08.870
 presidential or the governor or mayor who will decide whether you

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:14.960
 the doctor said it works and it off very well, right, even out of the bull's-eye

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:25.790
 that recipe here look there I think there is no city hall that takes from another is

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:30.710
 urgency and emergency, you place your order and ask for another one without a problem, not how

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:34.940

 improvement claims to have to pour money on the staff here our people the

00:31:15.349 --> 00:31:22.599
 vast majority of what we go there on the kc-390 but as the part goes by track

00:31:22.599 --> 00:31:29.539
 by sea was a donation from the Lebanese community and it is a gesture we made

00:31:29.539 --> 00:31:33.769
 problem here at the beginning of last year or that assuming fog is out to see

00:31:33.769 --> 00:31:38.169
 the people of israel are certain of these problems too but find a

00:31:38.169 --> 00:31:43.099
 opportunity told me to stay here for a while and they invented it there so no

00:31:43.099 --> 00:31:49.759
 I had a phone system to locate the body or not to locate the body

00:31:49.759 --> 00:31:55.759
 locate the last second that was alive right the cell phone signal

00:31:55.759 --> 00:32:00.119
 so info ah ok they were rescued valley ends

00:32:00.119 --> 00:32:05.759
 here cavalli canga for several bodies this technology came to our thing

00:32:05.759 --> 00:32:11.609
 that didn’t pass to us but we maybe even improved there we’re more

00:32:11.609 --> 00:32:16.889
 technology more and we were very grateful to the presence of israel here and had a

00:32:16.889 --> 00:32:23.099
 big deal today israel from the gutter the job and negotiated is that it opened a

00:32:23.099 --> 00:32:29.849
 way that we really have peace and prosperity in the region over there in the east

00:32:29.849 --> 00:32:35.340
 medium is obliged to black michel fear for having accepted this the invitation that

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:41.989
 became a mission together with him was paulo skaf was also ambassador

00:32:41.989 --> 00:32:47.250
 from Lebanon who was here traveled was our admiral

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:53.400
 the rock with the stars which is the chief secretary of the health secretariat of

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:59.340
 strategic affairs of the republic and a mission is being done is being

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:03.510
 conducted very successfully our farewell sao paulo also the

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:12.060
 event we went back there the kc-390 the pride of our remembrance is is doing a first

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:16.440
 trip outside of brazil i think presenter brazil is the first there was

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:20.130
 a new trajectory in Brazil crossed the Atlantic I do not know if it has already been to the other

00:33:20.130 --> 00:33:24.240
 country here i think not but the first international trip of this pride of

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:31.470
 our embraer company one more thing and well it was openness there may be nothing else

00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:37.940
 not belém do pará ibope schools is the pure truth here look

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:41.910
 and I don't want to say everything here, but there are certain

00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:47.500
 it is a large press body and clearly it was not hidden from me

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:53.110
 accused you a few days ago I was responsible for 100 thousand deaths in Brazil

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:58.720
 that's it, there's no reason for us to make decisions since then since the

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:08.100
 carnival we will be taking concrete steps to prepare will be tv is for to if

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:12.580
 you prefer in the problem that is coming here because you just knew you would come

00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:17.530
 sooner or later seeing that rescue operation there in ruan everyone

00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:23.080
 we have a 40 plus or minus 30 40 for sometimes lead to a little bit more then ok

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:29.830
 right and other measures have been taken several resume with that line here already

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:34.020
 that this big television gives your minister mandetta a space as

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:39.190
 kid, you know, a great marketer from TV Globo around the globe, I even sent one

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:46.630
 Madeira Ordinance of March 20, Ordinance 454 determined the isolation

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:53.810
 home of the person with respiratory symptoms and the people who are

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:58.730
 the waste at my address even asymptomatic for a period of 14 days or

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:02.510
 less I wrote a little bit wrong here ie isolation also take away

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:08.930
 everybody and that surname will be we had here inside the city of united states

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:13.580
 saying it had new york nearly seventy percent of people got infected

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:18.500
 here at home so the measure is logical I don't mean that I sent it up here

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:23.360
 in bad faith but as it didn't work I always advocated vertical isolation

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:30.050
 but then our supreme federal court decided to say that whoever took

00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:34.520
 the measures were the governor and mayor that the worst right I think less badly if the

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:39.320
 mayor made that decision not the governor but when the government takes

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:42.920
 a decision the mayor I could not make the milder decision than the

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:47.570
 governor can squeeze more have problems she doesn't want to blame anyone the

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:53.819
 time history will show that today whether or not that power was wrong

00:35:53.819 --> 00:35:59.789
 the hospital in the woods every hand it is possible that you’re all right one more great

00:35:59.789 --> 00:36:03.199
 certainly be able to be he even has this collection here that we

00:36:03.199 --> 00:36:10.529
 how is it a cancer I speak you have no alternative hit been to

00:36:10.529 --> 00:36:16.499
 medical recommendation and period I repeat my mother is 93 years old waiting

00:36:16.499 --> 00:36:21.269
 visit him there next week but if she is affected here she already has a doctor

00:36:21.269 --> 00:36:26.969
 side has already said that if she has it like that already the recipe is ready, all that’s left is him

00:36:26.969 --> 00:36:31.920
 he put the date is up to the city in my mother I'm more here as I said no

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:36.479
 it worked for me about 10 minutes more than 100 servers here who work in

00:36:36.479 --> 00:36:43.229
 building of the republic and we are going on with life we ​​cannot accommodate taking

00:36:43.229 --> 00:36:49.069
 care caution older care who are the most sensitive and touch life

00:36:49.069 --> 00:36:53.800
 I always said I want to repeat here that we have behind

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:59.140
 the two major problems ahead were the virus and the jobs and both

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:04.030
 should be treated responsibly and at the same time where

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:07.240
 this great television king he hits me all the time that you had

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:14.200
 ignoring the lives that started to be lost at that moment

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:20.080
 so we're going in here, let's try accountability, right and the

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:24.820
 clarification of the truth regarding the matter that he doesn’t give us to go to

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:29.200
 defend yourself from this because an accusation of genocide on me at the time

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:35.920
 noble or so this is very clear right I am responsible that should fulfill the

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:40.090
 condition is that the present is fulfilling the condition is with everything here

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:45.940
 we did almost 700 well where real in one way or another to fight the virus

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:52.090
 not only money in the vein directly the borrowed and municipalities right measures to

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:57.170
 avoid unemployment that the person says and they get weaker they are more prone

00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:02.989
 when acquiring a virus any disease and complicating the emergency aid that

00:38:02.989 --> 00:38:09.289
 costs 50 billion a month and there are people demagogically this is demagogy I think

00:38:09.289 --> 00:38:13.999
 which should be extended indefinitely are approximately 65 million

00:38:13.999 --> 00:38:19.609
 real nonsense people have people who get double the triple of that right ah ok

00:38:19.609 --> 00:38:25.309
 at his house 50 billion a month some say that it is people's money it is not

00:38:25.309 --> 00:38:29.900
 The people's money is that we saw that I’m sorry for how long you can take it

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:33.890
 if I could, I would give 10 thousand a month to everyone

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:38.829
 at home like socialism promises right is yours promises until peace equality

00:38:38.829 --> 00:38:43.060
 really equality you're going to have underneath but also

00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:48.010
 if you have anything this arrangement looks at one o'clock one dies

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:52.690
 worst inheritances that this pandemic will leave depression in people have

00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:57.930
 how many people how many how many millions of people run addicted to

00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:02.050
 low antidepressants is difficult sister blue sea is difficult to stir the number of

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:06.850
 deaths for you asking for disease has dropped frighteningly people who have key

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:10.540
 that the medical opinion to do a cancer preventive when he comes back

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:15.310
 I take back to the doctor for the next week with all the respect, you know?

00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:20.160
 I will not have more alternative but they did not do preventive that there is a hospital that

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:25.630
 governor mayor and are not all but only kitchen deals are prepared for

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:32.350

 escape the question that the mantra of the halen president people is their excellence is the

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:31.770
 fact on the right side I will answer sorry here ok

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:37.519
 in some one and then

00:40:37.519 --> 00:40:45.790
 a kiss ah it's all over son are you present

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:51.190
 that I said good night I was wondering if you were fully satisfied

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:56.110
 with yesterday's meeting come on augusto

00:40:56.110 --> 00:41:02.710
 and we have meetings, we’re running out of things, something that’s working

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:08.620
 right the intention to bring everybody we have a chat try to get it right

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:15.700
 that what is possible and today was partly over there by the exaggerated part of some

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:20.980
 media sectors, right, you talked about a stampede of the economy that would be against the

00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:27.540
 privatizations ok now it’s good enough for us to give a sound box nothing

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:32.260
 you know that for example i have how to determine which minister to do some

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:36.190
 thing the mayor of the senate has no way of determining which deputies and

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:41.080
 senators do that or vote and logically that they help and the

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:45.430
 interests as varied as possible the parliament became 28 I more dense so

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:49.620
 fully satisfied with the place I think that nothing will ever remain but just a big step

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:56.120
 the market is over, Brazil is in a privileged situation

00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:01.430
 hello most other countries here faced the same problem the

00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:07.130
 coronavirus it seems that the economy wants to recover, see it was falling under

00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:15.260
 and not in l in a second I the folks at the economy said yes we do have the money

00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:20.450
 entering the market here is emergency aid and a guarantee fund

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:28.100
 and that money as if it were a way to keep the body alive now the

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.850
 trade has to open I came belém do pará today there was on top of everything

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:39.410
 open right and we have to not let this big body from Brazil be there

00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:44.310
 succumb to then yeah I say everyone says this

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:50.340
 in search of launching each one to do their part, you know, and I'm not in Brazil

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:55.260
 because this way we break the economy does not catch I think it will catch

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:58.260
 it's not because paulo is already saying right because i have i also have

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:01.410
 obligation to give an injection of courage everyone is so many people that it seems that

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:07.650
 have to get it by the end of the year she gets it we go we go away we are

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:10.890
 very well until the last quarter in the past the first first going down

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:15.930
 it was also fine and then it came, you know this virus there that almost puts everything to

00:43:15.930 --> 00:43:21.050
 lose and now and the taste is done by logically that

00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:25.550
 a lot that was different but as far as possible it was very good to

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:30.950
 yesterday's profitable meeting only the head of the judiciary was missing for us

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:36.800
 see he could with looks like right and marta one less judicial year mine of

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:42.080
 supreme sometimes each one has an idea in front of the other subject but we have

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:48.260
 obligation to seek and improve the lives of those people who, how they voted

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:50.780
 that even those who didn’t come back, right, people who are seeing me here

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:54.339
 in this wonderful country called Brazil

00:43:54.880 --> 00:44:01.999
 use hi people today the eyes o together with

00:44:01.999 --> 00:44:07.190
 president of is called the act of symbology quite

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:12.190
 strong union around the reforms led by minister paulo guedes

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:16.610
 could not comment a little behind the scenes I did this the password was not

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:22.340
 promptly attended by the lord expects this gesture in relation to the possible march

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:27.770
 set of powers get an agenda of understanding thank you is that I

00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:34.550
 I speak the question of the economy Paulo Guedes is 99.9 percent with him must have 101

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:41.570
 percent he winter power is a matter of ceiling to ceiling hotel time ok

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:47.769
 floor under the simbio yes and more and more

00:44:47.769 --> 00:44:52.630
 you have less resources for you to do something you take two ministries

00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:59.170
 do not ask gray for example let's talk about the future of the track recovery pk

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:03.630
 make a bridge hi and he has a resource there I in

00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:08.700
 moment I'm five billion reais is not enough is there you go in

00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:17.490
 our darling's ministry there the marine the mdr he wants to conclude the thing

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:22.230
 conclude the work, right, the question of water to the northeast does not want to let the

00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:27.600
 program my house my life for the appeal and each time the blanket is more

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:33.540
 short right the defense our defense here of minister fernando the window fernando has

00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:38.460
 five strategic projects he wants he’s the string and he’s painting this year

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:43.110
 I have budget memory of history without running without with this monetary of yours

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:47.280
 lesser know the defense staff then some arrive for you is

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:53.030
 military and this ministry is going to be treated like that

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:56.329
 explain what she knows about this I'm raising for fernando has to take

00:45:56.329 --> 00:46:00.619
 from another place then the idea of ​​piercing the present ceiling which is just debate what the

00:46:00.619 --> 00:46:07.640
 problem present in the pandemic, right? We have the apec of war we have already

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:12.500
 we broke the ceiling in about 700 billion reais we can drill another 20

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:17.869
 I lose the justification if it is to come, no problem, I’m fine, but we understand

00:46:17.869 --> 00:46:23.880
 that water for example is to understand the purpose we ask the idea

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:29.309
 and plays are 60 million I’ll spend another 20 million or not Paulo Guedes will talk

00:46:29.309 --> 00:46:34.260
 is finalizing for and for the economy and for the market that

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:38.130
 it’s boring time taking a step there’s another one there at the tip of another power already

00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:42.750
 start talking I can't edit it properly instead of calling phone talking that

00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:46.380
 ok, I can take this one from here, unfortunately we don’t have

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:50.520
 style learn to scan all the time out there will not always someone arrives

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:54.359
 in the office there the phone talks to someone in the ministry and ends up leaking

00:46:54.359 --> 00:47:00.420
 that said like this ah let's make an appointment or Tuesday i will do it or not

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:06.060
 I'm not going to do it when the staff comes doesn't have everything articulated to give a

00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:11.339
 big blow to pierce the ceiling as if someone had money money intending to

00:47:11.339 --> 00:47:19.230
 get more on average 20 million is water from the northeast is sanitation revitalization

00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:25.530
 of rivers my home my life is right is in the corner touching other iso is it is

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:29.519
 as it happens here hello my dad over there as well

00:47:29.519 --> 00:47:37.710
 there was no 33 look the pest goat at br-163 small 50 km stretch as she

00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:41.910
 It started with gas, but it was the army that invested it there and see if I

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:47.099
 the br-101 didn’t work there either, so only 10 and 16 there in the pellet region

00:47:47.099 --> 00:47:50.880
 rio grande do sul army engineering battalion built there because the hand

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:55.829
 work is free ok you’re training our soldier also ok you know

00:47:55.829 --> 00:48:03.029
 use us to argue that everyone wants me, I didn’t bother freedom until I give it more

00:48:03.029 --> 00:48:07.440
 and look for the girl there, which is the most complicated ministry, right she treats

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:13.079
 of the engine of problems there that I did not accept this mass from her ministry there

00:48:13.079 --> 00:48:17.910
 for nothing in the problems that you have only the person as himself to solve

00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:20.940
 that matter there is no person who is of the brand he told me but has

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:25.980
 problem is also right here, ask to be a little boy, you changed yours

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:30.640
 situation to who knows resource also up to

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:37.510
 to advertise outside of Brazil, so it's around ninety-five

00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:42.730
 a little bit more of the budget is committed and the fight the fight at the point

00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:48.040
 following ours is healthy exists and we will have problem that the forecast for

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:52.150
 next year message will fall affect this book that happened i'm talking

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:56.800
 discussion of the agenda that you have there that we decided to carry on but someone

00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:01.150
 leaked and everyone there from the young pan because I, as I lined up in this thing, didn’t

00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:07.630
 market reacted dollar goes up stock market falls but always has to take some time tavera

00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:12.130
 I also don’t have a little patriotism it doesn’t hurt them, right?

00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:17.290
 stay there accepting this pyre although there are people who will have a band business

00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:23.350
 see how to get here many times, click on it, I’m right there to see if this is it

00:49:23.350 --> 00:49:29.950
 leak published in such a press location was fake news a lie

00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:35.520
 to move the market I make money and it's two more

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:40.600
 the cabral the president good night good night too

00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:44.430
 to the embratur ax president with whom we talked this week

00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:49.210
 President wanted to know how the process of creating the alliance is

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:53.800
 Brazil, which is the party you want to join, I know that at that moment

00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:58.930
 collecting signatures in progress, how is this process going, sir

00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:03.850
 thinks the party will be ready in time for the 2022 presidential election and the

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:07.750
 negotiations with other parties too or roberto jefferson president of ptb

00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:12.130
 including the interview that the program spoke quite a possibility that

00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:15.970
 you are part of the ptb, you also have this possibility, good president

00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:21.029
 thank you night it's hard it's not impossible but it's hard

00:50:21.029 --> 00:50:30.630
 the huge bureaucracy the pandemic delayed it is passed at the end of the line by tse and the

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:33.359
 do we know the behavior of some ministers with respect to new

00:50:33.359 --> 00:50:42.329
 parties so I can't invest 100% in the alliance despite the effort a lot

00:50:42.329 --> 00:50:46.019
 people around brazil today i'm here in pernambuco i have to look at the

00:50:46.019 --> 00:50:51.809
 parties and having received the invitation and three parties invited me to talk a

00:50:51.809 --> 00:50:55.499
 for roberto jefferson live ok, there are two more parties too

00:50:55.499 --> 00:51:00.869
 I talked to the present these two other parties have a room there and put

00:51:00.869 --> 00:51:08.099
 there, right, the psl also some finalized this finalization only and in a

00:51:08.099 --> 00:51:13.709
 reconciliation we put the conditions on the table to reconcile he likes there

00:51:13.709 --> 00:51:18.749
 here too I can’t just throw in the chip just a ring on what I

00:51:18.749 --> 00:51:22.960
 I hoped it would be ready I don't think it will be difficult to get

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:26.140
 ready this year but we will not dress like this we do not intend to style this idea

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:30.850
 but the possibility of cubing and I’m going to talk to the psl people who

00:51:30.850 --> 00:51:37.480
 despite having left there from its 43 44 parliamentarians who talk to me right

00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:40.870
 there are about eight there that you can’t talk to a difficult level where

00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:46.600
 led to the police who got into the personal issue with you personally is what

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:52.330
 company speaks here company page that hits me all the time and has already taken

00:51:52.330 --> 00:51:57.310
 that as true to the accusations but then there are six or seven there that is not

00:51:57.310 --> 00:52:01.540
 impossible to talk to these guys but he's talking to psl

00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:05.800
 also so I see a conciliate conciliate has to show who's

00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:10.450
 believing us why the right way back to talk to daniela is betraying me

00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:15.340
 I worked, I got a thousand 2100 natura 200 and and now the guy went back to

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:21.019
 there I say yes go back to have to have the justification if you go to another party

00:52:21.019 --> 00:52:25.609
 one of the guests in viseu why you will not put conditions and you want to

00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:31.009
 it will not be enough for you to be a party, note 10 is not possible, but it also cannot be

00:52:31.009 --> 00:52:36.110
 a party note 3 quarters in your party note 8 9 months you want to do

00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:41.390
 and it is not easy to deal with non-expensive police other than Brazil, you can visit yourself and take care of

00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:45.680
 party corrections the interests are as varied as possible right but everything

00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:50.180
 well i got in here because i wanted the volunteer to fight so i thank the

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:54.140
 god for my life and then miracle my election wants nothing to be

00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:57.790
 some do not have a big party because television does not appeal to

00:52:57.790 --> 00:53:03.850
 in my understanding god the people on our side saw us we will keep going

00:53:03.850 --> 00:53:08.180
 seeking largely by doing so that what I seek most is to lose interests

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:12.230
 our our country because if i go wrong everyone suffers night nobody

00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:14.710
 wanna go out

00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:22.930
 yes, but this married woman you heard from those who left maria hello dona maria rosa

00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:28.490
 maria ii the president very good night looks at

00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:32.750
 president was a goal-scorer yesterday that agreement is not a kind of pact with the

00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:36.020
 national congress to vote on important matters and define once and for all

00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:41.240
 all there obedience to the spending ceiling now president and two came out

00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:46.300
 secretaries and important government officials, and he remained half-suspicious that

00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:53.060
 there would be in the government a feeling against privatization I know of resistance right

00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:58.790
 of the public system but what is the importance of privatizing its

00:53:58.790 --> 00:54:06.950
 behind the president government that they are in deficit and the objectives

00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:17.000
 and it ends up privatizing right not letting it continue in governments today in great

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:24.109
 part are used by union or by parties that he knows I noticed that

00:54:24.109 --> 00:54:29.900
 business there and also it has state that the service provided can be done by

00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:35.540
 a private company this bigger intention has some state owned companies that i think

00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:40.700
 you have to keep it because it is because of the currency

00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:45.160
 a lot of money is made there if you count there

00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:52.630
 or send cigarettes and drinks there you do passport help then you do

00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:57.970
 where's see you now really so bike a lot of things you do you are going to do

00:54:57.970 --> 00:55:03.039
 you go to these files, you know, it's a company and outside you can buy it and do the

00:55:03.039 --> 00:55:08.109
 our money ok we know in a few years the role was to leave

00:55:08.109 --> 00:55:12.579
 exist but was led to sell more than 10 years serving me for more than ten years and

00:55:12.579 --> 00:55:15.280
 you will have to continue working at the mother's house at the grandmother's house too

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:20.530
 it was swollen in the past but it has good professionals it wasn’t in each is when

00:55:20.530 --> 00:55:25.000
 you can see the details ahead, right, the expense, whatever is done, do not talk to

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:30.069
 you’re also bringing you to stay behind because here you live up to miles of

00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:34.750
 Santos is entitled to this is a car and search the house for

00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:38.830
 example the health plans that we also have in the challenge to understand there

00:55:38.830 --> 00:55:44.050
 there are a lot of things so the goal of deprivation is that there is the product

00:55:44.050 --> 00:55:50.500
 end of the line I don't know I don't know it gets cheaper then this is the intention to disrupt

00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:57.700
 these issues we go servers is huge there is and the changes that happening to

00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:01.930
 few is now you will face resistance is the left parties

00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:07.840
 is not new is not critical from the left until the pt pc of the b psol pdt is

00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:12.760
 how rules are against privatization of interest whatever it looks like this

00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:20.200
 these state-owned companies have been used by that party in the past as is how it is

00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:24.910
 that corruption exploded on that job there I allotment of cargo for

00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:29.220
 another party, too, you know, it’s not just the subdivision, it’s a

00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:34.650
 it's a bargaining chip here that previous governments used i'm not sure

00:56:34.650 --> 00:56:41.220
 no but it looks like 2015/2015 and now last year we left this afternoon ok

00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:47.670
 surplus is because I have the criterion of putting people in there, coming out of 70 70

00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:51.720
 billion loss to 35 million again i'm not sure but that of a

00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:57.200
 profit there is crazy next 100 billion reais you can come here is very common

00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:01.950
 because this transition is worth something is worth counting here but if you

00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:09.270
 saw until today is in good the previous government a few years ago misery tourism know

00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:15.750
 if a city in france is receptive to tourism in brazil there or not

00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:24.180
 then they did a consulting consultancy or the temperature was valid if you use the name is

00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:29.230
 maria kicks in there i'm not listening to you here in the kicks there the price of the consultancy this

00:57:29.230 --> 00:57:35.700
 and from france may not receive brazilian brazilian presents control r $ 5000000

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:42.010
 sad is sad and then for you to see the fight it is often back there the

00:57:42.010 --> 00:57:45.940
 doll I'm 100 million why do I have to run happened that

00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:50.650
 little figure that went to promote brazil in new york i'm six million

00:57:50.650 --> 00:57:55.359
 of real the doll and the mark of the fall does not look like one got it on TV but

00:57:55.359 --> 00:58:01.020
 melons six billion reais good so this is what has to change the

00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:05.609
 Brazil was so changing, there is something already from the government, for sure it can only

00:58:05.609 --> 00:58:11.250
 a guy like you can only be patient back he’s with me

00:58:11.250 --> 00:58:16.800
 people were not the huge house my huge government you take the ministry

00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:21.780
 other Brazilian ies composed the airport with structure at the beginning can

00:58:21.780 --> 00:58:28.500
 have one thing wrong can he know everything doesn't know the mystery of the marine has

00:58:28.500 --> 00:58:35.720
 almost 20 thousand works in Brazil you and me I'm not thinking

00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:40.579
 administrator I have to find resources depending on the parliament depends

00:58:40.579 --> 00:58:45.650
 a lot of things we have good parliamentarians it helps us to prove things there solve

00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:51.170
 this subject but it’s not easy to touch this Brazil doesn’t know what hurts

00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:54.800
 not president when if I deliver a work done the transposition of the sound

00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:58.700
 francisco that the northeastern knows the importance of that and the people are

00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:02.300
 knowing that in addition to that Brazilian money there is no more to do it has a

 kite cars in the region the army is waiting to stay for a year two
