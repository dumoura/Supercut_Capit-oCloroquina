00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:59.330
 fair or capture seal did now guys the quick game here is the press there is the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.310
 better the national journalism federation is telling me that the press

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.069
 it was the violent attacks in the past and 50 and 58 percent of the violent attacks that

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.150
 that cold me so i'm a few days without talking to the press why not

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.090
 I want more I can't take it for you look there so I think this is the federation in

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.200
 selection of withdraw this change your thinking i'm going to talk now now the

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.910
 passed quickly quickly here last year six first months I

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.430
 I attended more laugh without journalists more than 100 journalism the first six months of

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.060
 last year is for a week in this so-called jawbreaker that I

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.860
 I usually do it at the exit and back here in front of dawn and in a

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.800
 of the week I in three hours of conversation with the press

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.820
 now when some journalist over there is abusing it he saw logically gives you the

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.050
 there is no juice there is no slap or even a bad word until today

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.950
 people respond also was not a little exalted because we are human beings

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.710
 the federation doesn’t like it I think I have to be subservient served and the

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.840
 tenderly polite to him until I'm there okay so no problem there

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.480
 and this contact with the press is

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.930
 we recorded yesterday today thursday in a little while i'm using it here in kenya

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:32.730
 soon afterwards it is a very important event in india it was already the capital is what

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.310
 what happens is captured every year is the date of the republic his maximum date, right and the

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.720
 only invites a boss on saturday come on the captain here this is cause for

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.750
 pride for the capitals with all of them since you are in the business, right, you mess with

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.730
 transport or head but you are not from the mines and energy to address for the

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.520
 Brazil that India increasingly uses ethanol in its fuel

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.930
 in the insect house there is a portion of porridge in seven percent

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.930
 animals ethanol this is advantageous for brazil it was taken into account right the origin of

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.840
 black raw material is not sugar, it's too early for the animals ethanol in store

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.780
 even produce less and by balancing the price of this one

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.760
 commodity in the market so there then this brazil to china mix more alcohol

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.020
 to their fuel because the hood I don't know them that the pollution in the

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.970
 capital of india is terrible our calling in the voice of a billion and 300

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.950
 million inhabitants and ethanol is less polluting so everyone comes to the kitchen

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.330
 india wins brazil everyone comes to know others we will deal with there is the

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.490
 market is the name that we have ahead of us we’re going to open it’s on tereza avenue

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.470
 cristina what we have a lot to transport are cowboys she's ok

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.910
 dealing with this matter if god wants a trip he really took advantage of the ones here

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.900
 so in a little while they are landing there from India

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.780
 the capeta capeta let's talk briefly here the about we took this week to

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.070
 concession of the dutra front it will end next year and you are

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.039
 working from now on to renew its concession and painted a

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:19.840
 news there that on the occasion of the renovation we have one more toll bar

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.240
 and another toll plaza in the region of guarulhos is not our

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.940
 position create more toll plaza how are you going to equate

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.160
 and the bidding for this new conception of the president, we presented the

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.700
 model for society we are conducting public consultation several manifestations

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.780
 were made during the public consultation we only allowed ourselves to take several

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.440
 conclusions we have already taken several matters with you to make decisions

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.750
 decision sir already decided is also a number of things so the idea that no

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.920
 there are no tolls, in fact, there was no toll, there was no square

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.030
 toll in guarulhos it is good to say that we use a free flow system there

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.240
 myself system that there are some countries in europe where you pay only for

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:09.150
 kilometer run where there is the porch there but people also understood that it is a

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:12.510
 the other's president ends up being an avenue on the guarulhos são paulo link

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:17.370
 so in the fair also that the user pays and this is already being withdrawn the

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.410
 model is is the adjustments are going to be made to decorate concession what the

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.580
 sir always determines for us right to favor the user to take the state of

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.920
 up the user decrease the cost decrease the suffering

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.630
 a quality public service of 400 km is approximately a little more to

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:40.150
 four times around the round it was at the moment 14 toll plazas the

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:45.790
 value is humbling R $ 15 is heavy which the problem you make a concession

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.720
 of this for how many years on average 20 years measures 25 has five days so what

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:55.600
 happens it is usually in the contract which every year increases the ipca not always

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:01.390
 now I need it, it doesn’t follow the salary I’m on the highways in Brazil

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:06.820
 it's absurd ok there is a place where you spend more fuel than with a piece

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.780
 we will try to fix it there I will try to fix it there so that everything right that

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:14.020
 we will have good news that we will notice that the river-san route

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.800
 Paulo will be cheaper everything will be cheaper and the concessions that

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:23.680
 we are doing tend to produce lower values ​​here my dream

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.310
 here you can put it is for example right every year the store toll has to have the

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:32.479
 readjust but if it is not the ipca for her i will kick here ninety percent

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:40.180
 special zep ninety percent of special 95% that came out one hundred percent that

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:46.669
 I repeat here the salary adjustments do not follow do not have followed and

00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:50.650
 do it so this is a concern because you get it after 10 15

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:54.740
 reaching the age of 20 the toll is on paying saw the company there to charge it ok

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.979
 screwing about what's going to happen you're a contract thing let's honor those

00:07:57.979 --> 00:08:02.960
 contracts so this is a concern i want you to take it ok for the couple not

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:07.400
 only data how much is more concessions also if possible I know it is difficult for me

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.520
 I'm talking here at I understand a little bit of math, rest assured

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:16.160
 ok it would almost be a price table there it is almost not like this is not this thing

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.830
 ok but let's take it forward here this thing is ok so you can drop it from 15

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:24.949
 years for these four toll plazas sadness president side ok

00:08:24.949 --> 00:08:29.940
 right I have no toll in guarulhos or bar but no two new ones

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:34.740
 the toll then what is being studied right logically that the criticisms

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:38.039
 are welcome now the way that some press organs disseminate right

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:43.470
 in these hardest hit regions guarulhos barra mansa is that never right ok

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:46.950
 I called the mayor of Barra Tame I talked to him I talk a lot

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:51.090
 calm obviously nobody wants to pay a toll know that the mayor is

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:54.600
 defending your area this community you put a piece there I know well

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.930
 region you stop this strain was fourth for rezende already went to bar

00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:04.730
 tame even a round lap with the situation here now girlfriend around

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:13.920
 so there is a very big juice to handle the car, right and the guy here who presents

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:19.650
 your proposal look i went there in union i know how much i live flow grandma lives if da

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:24.600
 window the road is all right so I promise to see the tarcísio here goes

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.640
 lower this toll and we will see the issue of the annual readjustment so as not to

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.410
 be hi is because it will be full i think all

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.139
 world liked model president in the end we will have

00:09:35.139 --> 00:09:38.139
 we will improve the service level and we will be able to offer

00:09:38.139 --> 00:09:42.459
 a cheaper rate the result will be very good for everyone and then

00:09:42.459 --> 00:09:45.700
 some states particularly rio de janeiro need a lot of investments that

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:49.540
 will see with these concessions I think we will offer a good product for the

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:54.610

 back there and 14 she ended up until the cars that are running around are what we

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:41.110
 we want is the new mercosur plate and what is the difference the old plate had

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:52.180
 a series of elements had a chip had sinusoidal net elements some designs were

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:59.200
 a little bit we already have to pay we would have to pay some right

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:04.490
 for those who created that drawing then it is very expensive in addition it had a monopoly

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:09.800
 the stamper of the guy who is going to manufacture for us we ended it all but

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:15.020
 we removed the chip we removed the sinusoidal elements we left a simple plate

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:20.120
 and it will have traceability because the whole plate will have a qr code we will have

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:24.260
 that brought around you to see this code zinho here we will be able

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:29.090
 citizen police authority and will be able to photograph he will have the citizen arrive

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:33.290
 here the application put it here it knows it will know where to stay it was

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:40.220
 emplacado which is the model owner will have a part of the chassis available

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:43.550
 to Brazil if that license plate with that car was stolen also with all

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:47.030
 sure it’s in the system it’s going to be in the system it’s the system so we

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:50.720
 traceability will be bad but we end the monopoly of

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.830
 so the thing is on the market is open and this will make the

00:15:54.830 --> 00:15:59.920
 board is cheap or there will be no cost increase now the most important

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:04.959
 and i have my car i will be obliged to vote this sign not who has the car

00:16:04.959 --> 00:16:08.860
 emplacado will continue with the plate that exists this plate will accompany the car

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:13.060
 by the end of the service life the new license plate will come to the new cars who score

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:17.050
 buy a new car sign the new car will already receive the new license plate so

00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:22.449
 this is a student no obligation of the DMV to provide then this

00:16:22.449 --> 00:16:26.380
 new user will not have to warm his head with this we take the tram walking

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:32.410
 and you did the best you could, but there were already 17 states, the result

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:37.360
 using it was already my understanding it was not well thought out that in my understanding it was not well

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:42.430
 could be just our plate you know it's hardly going to work with

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:46.029
 another one for you to do when the second january 2014 was made entered the

00:16:46.029 --> 00:16:51.220
 venezuela too and now losing it is already out of a park another country

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:55.829
 left in the Mercosur, the other may also enter, but it was also made possible

00:16:55.829 --> 00:17:00.339
 thank you there and the effort in this matter I hope

00:17:00.339 --> 00:17:06.220
 let the plate work there and the price of this one today is close to the current one

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.939
 old board is running so it's not ready so how did we get the

00:17:09.939 --> 00:17:15.250
 graphic element took the curve the drawing took the chip broke the monopoly

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:19.510
 of the stampers the new plate will come out at practically the same old price it will

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:24.549
 leaving disrespect is made change we will have represented brazil a

00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:32.620
