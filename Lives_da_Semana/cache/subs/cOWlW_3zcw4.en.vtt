00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:03.709
good evening everyone

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:12.719
 Thursday 6 pm 30 minutes to my right here our spokesman

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:20.279
 took out diego muds on the left that i already some df chief cylinder

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.849
 and we intend every Thursday at 6:30 pm to make matters

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.520
 most important of the week we analyzed as well as we could right

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.710
 our doubts that you are started we can next week is

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.320
 address this issue and thus respond to the demand of all of you and

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.550
 looking for solutions we really like you to introduce yourself

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.690
 proposals and ideas that they can ask us to serve the population and also

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.750
 obviously it's making your life easier we know a lot of things wrong with

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.360
 monies the ritual is given to roseana at first not so much do says

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.750
 do a lot that was done wrong

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:21.000
 over the past 20 years today morning we've been celebrating the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.520
 your 111th birthday I used the word and work will give

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.700
 controversy at a given moment when I said that in Brazil we owe the forces

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.540
 armed our democracy that our freedom and so everywhere in the world

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.869
 and that speech has already started to take the most varied possible interpretations

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:56.579
 so your side here more active older more experienced but the situation

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.130
 having as a minister who is a person who advises us is that person who is not

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.969
 difficult even always helps us to seek a new

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:10.940
 solution not only yours our my statement today lázló andor janeiro

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.090
 something that leaves a doubt that I would be on the wrong path is controversial.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.380
 I talked about what was called in Brazil, they were always there for democracy

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.110
 and freedom on the plate and there is nothing controversial about finding your

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:34.910
 words were said offhand for a qualified exchange and were placed

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:43.250
 exactly for those who love in their matter those who live daily the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.970
 problem of maintaining democracy and freedom

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.500
 characterizing and exhorting him to continue to play a role that comes

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.410
 doing and being the guardians of democracy and freedom and tried to

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.590
 distort it as if it were a gift from the military or civilians or anything

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.910
 addition the armed forces are determination pig

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:17.000
 constitutional and legal job holders is legal from violence can shock

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.430
 some but this is what is written and the armed forces are responsible for

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.590
 this maintenance if you do an example see the example of venezuela because the bush

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.389
 power is being maintained because the armed forces are holding the

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:38.450
 practically deposed president of venezuela because that fidel castro lasted

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.519
 the time that the power that the Cuban armed forces maintained the dictatorship lasted

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.380
 then according to the tendency of the armed forces according to the

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.260
 determination of the forces of nato and this ends up being the fundamental factor of the

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.280
 country's political regime and in the case of brazil it is clear that the armed forces are

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.720
 a pillar of freedom democracy and it is not because the sound

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.280
 I also talked about the bodies of the animals of the

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.060
 unlike what happened in the past 20 years will be

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.459
 treated in general with dignity and with respect after all is in all

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.820
 researches generally by force but firstly in accepting a

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.700
 champion of the dissident championship the objective civil control advocated by

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.940
 samuel hut with him and advocates that the armed forces should be the stronghold

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.020
 of this civilian control and naturally the Brazilian armed forces

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.150
 already are for vehemently defending democracy

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.170
 we talk about raising the issue of pension reform a new pension the

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.400
 military personnel are also subject to the new rule

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.700
 obviously respecting your specifics

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:59.760
 so it was to say that in this new proposal for a new social security it is in first

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.230
 place fight against the light pide the parliamentarian will retire with the

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.320
 inss ceiling across five thousand eight hundred reais

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.280
 so the other categories were not like that our pronouncement there and we right

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.300
 it is not because what we need to do is a social security reform that will bring

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.550
 accounts she’s more than just visiting and we don’t want brazil in the future to

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.770
 turn into a greece where it hit bottom on the economic issue and we

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.870
 we do expect to approve this reform, which is fine, that parliament is sovereign

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:39.870
 to make any possible changes we just hope it’s not too much

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.760
 dehydrated so that it usually reaches its goal and under recourse to us

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:51.990
 investing in jobs security health and education this is what we learn from

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.600
 new pension reform that we know some people dislike yes we

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.190
 we will fight privileges and we will show brazil the path of growth

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.180
 I would like to introduce

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:12.930
 the work developed by the communication secretariat is and in consortium with the

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.789
 Ministry of Economy to facilitate understanding of the project presented by the

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:20.210
 our president

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:26.610
 we have to help in brazil as information is known to everyone

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.020
 awaiting a provisional measure the Corinthians that deals with the union tax

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:37.169
 that is, the union and perhaps want to understand the contribution of its

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:40.800
 associates and he will have to issue the ticket and the worker

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.610
 if you agree with the cbf he thinks that your union

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.389
 is really doing a good job to take a year here account in the valley

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:51.810
 because I already said that if it were, it is not mandatory

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.740
 so there was a very good acceptance for society, we hope that the

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.259
 great majority parliament is not linked to unions approves this measure

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:08.490
 because it does justice to everyone in Brazil and you also say that this month

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.880
 March we spoke three official visits to

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:18.080
 countries are united israel and xvii obviously we're going to do something concrete

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:24.710
 on these visits do not accept marathons with the ministries interested in this trip

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:31.440
 are finalizing the possible proposals for agreements and partnerships we have with this

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.419
 country and makes travel in my understanding that it was quite profitable for our

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:40.440
 brazil for sure i will enjoy and treat

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.599
 of another subject that was put by a part of the press that way

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:51.990
 incorrectly reported that the corporate presidency card had spent

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:57.889
 16% more in January 2019 than in January 2018

00:07:57.889 --> 00:08:04.650
 they forgot that the inauguration period was not in January 2018 it was

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:08.290
 the president the other day nor vice president and now in

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:13.060
 January 2019 we had the president was leaving power the

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:17.230
 president was who was elected plus the vice president

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:24.640
 then a whole apparatus for the inauguration the arrival of a foreign president to

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.390
 other authorities this whole movement is love and it's over

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:32.890
 making a corporate card increase to your left and reported as if

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:39.760
 had an extravagant which didn’t happen and the increased expense was 16%

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:46.900
 now as a fan a global corporate card expense found 28%

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:51.610
 unfortunate unfortunately the company took that negative part worth disclosed that

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:56.710
 was not so negative because last year's expenditure had a

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:00.730
 president just right and in that water there were two presidents and one

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:05.040
 vice president a subject that interests you a little while ago we announced that

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.540
 will start with a project through what will be in the last year the project to

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:15.130
 our infrastructure girl the tarcíso which is an army captain who is

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:20.350
 formed by the ine that is tendered by the stage camera let's get help

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:23.680
 parliament or increase the validity of the driver's license and five to ten

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.190
 years is a very important spine thing

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:31.440
 I talked to Minister Tarsus

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:42.720
 but it is impossible for you to travel without getting a ticket and you know that in the end it is

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.790
 or says trusting that the goal is to reduce accidents is not because today is very

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:51.480
 more concerned with looking at the human side of your engagement at all times to

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.680
 see the winding of the track so a new thing that was raised here from

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.120
 same party take note of the end of the money the money is yours the fine

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:09.180
 you pay a percentage of the toll levy the company has to

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:15.660
 apply in maintenance tapurah for painting making the inter wire among other things and

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:21.780
 companies now discovering that monitoring can be part of that

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:26.640
 type of service that is the behavior are the electronic spines if you spend

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.600
 a lot of stolen money he touches collected with the toll that in the future

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.070
 will give more profit to those who are really exploring the spine

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:40.710
 electronics that you have a terrible job with regard to maintenance

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:45.360
 of the highway our decision we no longer have any new electronic spine in the

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.970
 Brazil the spines that may exist

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.970
 many is when it lost its validity

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:55.560
 at first, at the beginning, they will not be renewed, I remembered some before I already gave

00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:01.650
 the line to the region of mambucaba that i already made was also from the river the action of

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:09.600
 global car to generate some cast is hell there are dozens 60/70 speed bump

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.620
 electronics at 60 or 40 an hour and when you walk there in rio de janeiro

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:20.610
 copacabana leblon is you walk to 70 plateau is obliged and the membership does not understand

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:25.380
 it was exactly in this sense it is worth remembering that the denit, until recently

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:29.510
 time was in the hands of political parties

00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:35.580
 this apartment is now really geared towards working 100% in

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.410
 benefit of the two

00:11:39.769 --> 00:11:44.689
 he in the reserve of the brazilian army is the santos son is there in power is in

00:11:44.689 --> 00:11:50.089
 limit and certainly looks sees space for services we don't have much service and our

00:11:50.089 --> 00:11:53.230
 government is not worth saying that just military here now again

00:11:53.230 --> 00:12:00.889
 will make it possible for us to give extra attention to the military who are doing the

00:12:00.889 --> 00:12:03.709
 zealous work with many civilians also from our government has been doing

00:12:03.709 --> 00:12:08.259
 now congratulations to your children and congratulations

00:12:08.259 --> 00:12:12.259
 autarchy right two colleagues over time our academy

00:12:12.259 --> 00:12:15.790
 military of the black needles doing a good job here at the group's stand

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:21.709
 something but stopped at the great says that the information

00:12:21.709 --> 00:12:31.069
 a curiosity only is the bank of brazil in a public notice opened a tender for

00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:40.519
 technical assistant and looks only at the rigging level and there in the requirement for

00:12:40.519 --> 00:12:45.649
 you and technical assistance you had to take diversity courses

00:12:45.649 --> 00:12:55.220
 and prevention of moral and sexual harassment in education he speaks ongoing in that sense

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:59.569
 I called plenary in Brazil he confirmed together with preventing the notice is

00:12:59.569 --> 00:13:04.579
 true that the mother was being made the demand but that edict snow goal

00:13:04.579 --> 00:13:10.339
 until March 1 in future notices no longer having this obligation

00:13:10.339 --> 00:13:15.199
 now the council having you, right, if it was approved recently, it was

00:13:15.199 --> 00:13:18.920
 required and if bomb had it can go to court to work

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:23.389
 although I will try with the bank of Brazil, even if this is avoided if

00:13:23.389 --> 00:13:28.189
 opens a new term so that people don't have that diversity course and

00:13:28.189 --> 00:13:32.689
 prevention of moral and sexual harassment can make a contest can be valid and was

00:13:32.689 --> 00:13:37.889
 in 35 technical assistant courses and 60 then a good professional

00:13:37.889 --> 00:13:43.829
 in brazil sensus well i thought you are ready

00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:50.999
 concluded in brazil after all just to talk i will do what i want is that the

00:13:50.999 --> 00:13:56.189
 Brazil in addition to doing more here in the pss for the love of god, right

00:13:56.189 --> 00:14:04.859
 the last article here i would watch the video of a lady who was

00:14:04.859 --> 00:14:08.519
 talking about your daughter's vaccination booklet

00:14:08.519 --> 00:14:17.160
 the integrated vaccination booklet because the booklet right here in front

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:24.959
 says it’s for children aged 9 to 16 from 9 years old and in the end she

00:14:24.959 --> 00:14:31.079
 had no wallet in hand did not show certain figures that does not go well with all

00:14:31.079 --> 00:14:40.230
 make sure that boys and girls from nine units have access to that

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:44.369
 criticism of the lady we ask people our strengths

00:14:44.369 --> 00:14:50.269
 can serve as federal health jesus was so go to the health booklet

00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:55.980
 mental is 2012 Mrs. dilma rousseff and was printed

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:59.790
 in large quantities are 40 pages has a lot of information

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:05.689
 that yes a lot of good information doesn’t even need the end of it that really

00:15:05.689 --> 00:15:10.829
 it gets complicated in my understanding if you will think it is not a right

00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:15.419
 time so it's a suggestion the first one, right, who has a wallet at home gives a

00:15:15.419 --> 00:15:19.169
 look because it’s going to be in the hands of your genes if you don’t think it’s the

00:15:19.169 --> 00:15:22.709
 in case you remove these pages here that deals

00:15:22.709 --> 00:15:26.369
 of this type of subject that we have done here is enough in the violence

00:15:26.369 --> 00:15:31.619
 I called the minister of health for a date in Mato Grosso do Sul

00:15:31.619 --> 00:15:37.799
 the wife of the year for him and then the solution is that it was to tell you that he took

00:15:37.799 --> 00:15:42.420
 will make a new booklet with less for cheaper and its figures

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:48.510
 no and we will quickly distribute collect these antennas for the way

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:54.120
 right in my head is right and let's not forget something here

00:15:54.120 --> 00:16:01.500
 the last activity here right tomorrow international women's day and has

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:07.350
 in my mother cries with alloy port dealer is with 90 unit out

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:11.579
 from the ribeira valley i want to send a hug to all

00:16:11.579 --> 00:16:16.829
 Brazilian women were kidnapped while we are here because of them

00:16:16.829 --> 00:16:21.930
 that you are very, very important I am very important and our life the oil

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:26.820
 Brazil a kiss in everyone's heart is the president we have here is a

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:52.420
 burial is that there is a lot of difficulty because

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:58.570
 so easiness in the transparency of the whole building ps did not only for work in

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:03.940
 tatá countries is from Flemish or in here for natural talent so

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:09.370

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:53.470
 made known by the news and is official information from the president

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:57.940

 in March 2014 that the banana import issue was altered by others

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:41.640
 the equator has a scene webb problem that is not simply repealing

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:47.010
 I think that finally we have the Athena study of China so that this is

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:50.610
 information is revoked and put an end to this ghost of banana imports from the

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:54.660
 ecuador where you can hardly understand how can a banana get out of the

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:58.470
