00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.410
and there and there

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:20.070
 and then in Brasilia, April 19th, 19 hours a

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.599
 elisângela my left our interpreter libras has a right pedro

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.439
 guimarães our president of the federal savings bank works lightly enough

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:37.230
 quick and the subject of the moment right I emergency aid before that wish

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.000
 the prompt recovery for the siqueira the presenter of the tv network here got sick

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.769
 yesterday they want him to come back quickly because despite my

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:52.080
 neighbor the time whenever I post it I watch it there you want it with your mood

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.120
 with your joy brings to mind is good information and speaks the language of the people

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.250
 a hug and want bro bro the matter moment here pedro

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.520
 and it’s the first one we’ve already paid the box one has already paid and around 33 million

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.010
 33 million people have already received we have an expectation of

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.280
 number of people more went beyond that then it was the law and there are a few million I'm

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.270
 complaining that we a few minutes complaining about what you said to him

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.900
 corner this is we made president the biggest insertion program ie the

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:36.080
 people could have accounts they did not have against the history bank certainly the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.710
 Brazil and any country I know what happens there were more than 45

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.200
 millions of people who signed up so we were expecting something like

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:56.840
 20 million 25 and 45 have already registered so this is the biggest point ie a

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.260
 very large volume of people and some of them

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.470
 in several of them they have not yet received the answer because it is under analysis by the

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.300
 the whole group that is doing it has people who wrongly filled in the error of

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.520
 cpf certainly had it when the person president did not put the

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.530
 cpf correctly she couldn't even go to the second stage what happened

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.070
 was that many people who had some kind of problem with electoral justice

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:35.700
 around 12 million people were only able to start registering in the

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.550
 last friday so only as of last friday this group that had

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.730
 a problem with electoral justice can register we estimate that 4 million

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.250
 people have registered since Friday who had some kind of

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.800
 previous problem but there were also a lot of people who had a job was a server

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.250
 public so the income on the court was there to shoot

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.240
 it wasn't even in bad faith, I thought I had a right, then I don't have a right, so

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.780
 regrets it is this fine comb that is being made I think another ten days

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.760
 there must be an end point, right, and we must also start before

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.620
 complete the 30 days of receipt of the installment must begin will begin to pay

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.820
 second installment yes that very important point president government bolsonaro

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.950
 who organized all this benefit together with Minister Paulo

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.800
 guedes who idealized this benefit for the informal we have three

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:51.100
 citizenship ministry groups the box and the dataprev each with their role there is

00:03:51.100 --> 00:04:00.520
 the least chance of this government making a payment has to have

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.890
 money is in the budget so whatever

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:10.340
 happens the money already exists for the first the first installment actually

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.850
 for all but that as we had a much larger number of people than

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.850
 anyone imagined they did the registration is you need a few days

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:29.090
 in fact, it's practically solved so that there is a complementation or

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.180
 be it going to increase the value of the budget so because of that given that this

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:42.290
 government lord government will never do anything crazy there will be no

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.180
 no chance for us to pay without budget is without percent approved

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.970
 and I repeat here before completing 30 days of receiving the first right installment

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.140
 already guarantees that they will pay the second installment, right, and these people who have already received

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.260
 this is in a clean relationship then some scenes I have no problem

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:07.050
 and it goes almost a click goes to is not for everyone is for who is the first

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.760
 day and whoever has birthday in january february and march joys we already have

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:18.870
 president is 33 million two hundred that have already been paid has another 10 million

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:24.360
 people who are going to receive next week more family allowance so they are already

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:31.920
 43 million right first hand we received the resource from the ministry of

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:37.860
 citizenship then only as soon as we announce the first installment too 1.9

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:44.070
 million people who are informal so we had paid 13.1 and

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:50.970
 we will increase we will increase to 15 million people this resource will be deposited

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:57.060
 by the box on Friday night from Saturday people will be able to

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.240
 withdraw the volume of 1.2 billion reais more

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.960
 oh and whoever for example got the family grant let's suppose i got the scholarship

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:12.580
 R $ 200 family will receive 600/600 plus class 1200 or eighteen hundred there is

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:19.210
 a series if you have two family members who have a chance you

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.340
 going to receive 1200 a 1800 but what is going on the president the values

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.940
 are very significant is the level number of people is surprising us

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:36.090
 positively and this is what is making this program a success

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:41.199
 it is also not for may june for the only one who receives who receives is not entitled to

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:46.630
 guarantee fund will be able to request even 45 to receive from the fifteenth

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:51.280
 of June if I am not mistaken and still have a second the benefit will be paid within

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:56.530
 few weeks that unemployment insurance assistance then on the issue of

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:01.249
 unemployment will also have a second benefit according to

00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:07.009
 the secretary is bruno bianco dominici paulo guedes around 24 million

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:12.579
 people so we have 54 million people who were expected here

00:07:12.579 --> 00:07:18.439
 conversation with the minister the only one we expect at least 60 million more

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:24.499
 because we’ll have another 24 million people to help with the issue of

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:32.209
 unemployment and we will have 60 million people for the ggts issue because the

00:07:32.209 --> 00:07:37.579
 last year paid exactly 60 million people in the immediate bag

00:07:37.579 --> 00:07:43.039
 so it is a very large number we will have payments in April May and June

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:51.319
 the issue of r $ 600 emergency aid as of May the question of unemployment aid

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:58.579
 and in June the issue of fgts these things this color of people in insurance

00:07:58.579 --> 00:08:01.959
 unemployment and it's a personal concern are people

00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:05.559
 who lost black exactly that I don't I don't want to kick numbers here but they are

00:08:05.559 --> 00:08:09.309
 millions of people who lost jobs you are not mistaken I saw a story

00:08:09.309 --> 00:08:14.679
 today I don’t know if it’s true that we read it has to come to Santa Catarina

00:08:14.679 --> 00:08:20.169
 would have lost I'm 400 thousand formal jobs in santa catarina 400

00:08:20.169 --> 00:08:26.859
 thousand formal jobs i will discuss here the recessive measures right for

00:08:26.859 --> 00:08:33.550
 avoid people having a party with my name tomorrow, it’s okay, but it’s

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:38.349
 millions the number of people who lost formal employment without counting the

00:08:38.349 --> 00:08:46.640
 informal settlements that it was estimated at 38 million people that a considerable part

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:56.450
 you will no longer go to the square to sell a barbecue to sell a sign cloth

00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:03.620
 luminous put the basement bag on the side and sold the ice cream here whack in the game

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:09.380
 football this is a concern that now I see that part of society

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:16.520
 right there are concerned a lot of politicians start and worry I had with

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:21.920
 the governor ibaneis he downloaded the new decree now where he is having the

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:27.370
 requirement of the mask on public roads practically he opened all trade

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:34.510
 other states are following along the same lines is unfortunately saw him arrived and

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:38.600
 unfortunately and continues to lead people to death

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.100
 unfortunately especially the elderly and

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.620
 education that has some kind of disease plus a truth that no one disputes right

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:51.279
 sixty to seventy percent of the population is going to be infected no one

00:09:51.279 --> 00:09:56.709
 happens number am from then on says people all over the world is that the country starts

00:09:56.709 --> 00:10:02.350
 to really go back to normality to be able to say that it’s getting free

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:08.769
 now such a job thing that was being destroyed from back there from there from

00:10:08.769 --> 00:10:14.139
 has always been a concern of mine and I imagine how I got beaten by the media

00:10:14.139 --> 00:10:21.269
 Brazilian that always story right life you don't recover economy you recover

00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:27.730
 two problems I believe but one thing doesn’t have the number here but between Brazil

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:33.250
 for example has a per capita income has an economy and a poor country on the other

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:37.630
 African continent for example life expectancy lives here or a

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:42.110
 time there unpacked and love here we have to have day

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.730
 and what is g1

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:51.790
 good so if our income is going to fall and death comes sooner this is what i

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:56.440
 I always tried to bring the knowledge of the people I could not escape the truth I’m

00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:03.040
 responding to proceedings inside and outside of brazil you will be accused of genocide for

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:10.090
 to have defended a different thesis from oms is just talk so much and follow the ms right the

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:14.710
 director presents one in this is a doctor is not a doctor knew that the president of

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:18.430
 same thing as talking here in Brazil the face of the box was not someone from

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:24.190
 economy has no place is it the other way around not doing anything there for centuries

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:28.870
 he you see this for example you already have nothing in this right then president of

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:35.170
 ms is not a doctor oh ok and the heavy has to follow the

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:40.210
 ms have to follow ministry of justice 5 and determinations guidelines as per

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:46.450
 example anvisa also says in the law the last one in the law that deals with this matter

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:52.060
 this year, right, there are certain issues to resist, but it is a vision that has to

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:57.720
 be consulted and was not consulted has one thing more has two more when it is

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:05.640
 I have another important point from Monday now on the 27th we

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:11.950
 we will pay people who have a digital account at the federal savings bank or

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:17.890
 be president that they 15 million that we have already opened from digital accounts and that

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:24.700
 had no account they will be able to start withdrawing the money to withdraw the

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:30.370
 money in the lotteries and tennis shoes inside the agencies so January

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:35.750
 February on the twentieth and the fair and there it goes for 10 days this is

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:40.730
 very important because at the beginning in the first two weeks president we

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:46.760
 deposited in digital accounts but we wanted to give a spacing so for

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:54.500
 everyone who has a digital account starting this Monday already starts the

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:59.870
 receipt at the cashier's mouth either at the atm or the lottery this is very important

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:05.690
 because normally the most needy population and where the government of

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:10.790
 You are generating a very important question that is not only this benefit

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:15.730
 in this moment of crisis is changing helping to change the lives of these people

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:21.890
 that for the first time in their lives they will have access to the financial system

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:27.150
 to a free account and also has an ordinance published in the

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:31.860
 today and the ministry of defense and justice that disciplines the

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:37.680
 quantity of ammunition that the people here who are the collector and sniper as well

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:42.090
 how one who has the individual size of fire water can acquire along

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:47.910
 the middle of the year as well as throughout the year so it's good news because it's

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:55.290
 the issue of selling ammunition in Brazil was rationalized so it was there

00:13:55.290 --> 00:14:04.530
 facebook has to find this ordinance until then and whoever is a sniper had it for whoever it is

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:09.780
 collector me as someone who is nothing like that but we have here at home will know

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:14.760
 how many ammunition will you be able to buy throughout each month or throughout each

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:24.970
 do you like an eraser there is no time there after you read the ordinance it was worth the

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:32.019
 it is just one more thing the president is important given the issue of queues in

00:14:32.019 --> 00:14:37.860
 some cash agencies what we do three very important things

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:44.410
 thousand and one hundred agency branches at the box opened two hours earlier ie 8 hours

00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:49.329
 in the morning instead of ideas what are these agencies the most crowded agencies

00:14:49.329 --> 00:14:56.410
 truth we already started opens on Saturday this Saturday around 800

00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:02.589
 agencies opened as on the 21st holiday so the box we are going to open on

00:15:02.589 --> 00:15:07.740
 Saturday we will open on holidays and the third point president we

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:15.819
 we hire more watchdogs but it is outsourced people to help in

00:15:15.819 --> 00:15:22.089
 training in the organization of queues at 1,400 branches, that is, two thousand and

00:15:22.089 --> 00:15:28.220
 eight hundred people to and in the organization because yes in some

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:32.210
 agencies you had an agglomeration and it is this balance that you always talk about

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:37.670
 enters the issue of fundamental health and the issue of fundamental economics if we

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:42.920
 put everyone to receive on the same day or in 2 days 10 15 million

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:48.800
 people should receive there are 125 thousand people accompanying me and there are 91 thousand

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.250
 accompanies in the young pan so you who are accompanying me will end mine there

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:57.710
 in a little bit more young dad will be happy to hear augusto nunes is

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:02.270
 maria has more is not over that also there with a lot of independence that if the name

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:07.640
 of him here but the august to use maria is priceless there we will be young pan is the

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:13.700
 radio that turned into television is a really are news of the day with a lot of

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:19.130
 ownership and co-responsibility is one thing he

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:24.390
 there are few information games there are, right, so it’s worth it

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:29.640
 the person and go back to young pan one more thing was there I sun already comes to

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.980
 everyone there a hug until Thursday if god wants
