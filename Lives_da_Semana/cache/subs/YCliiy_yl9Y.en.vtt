 marked her own when she was 30 years old Gera she hits the captain already

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.750

 humble is really something that encourages us to continue working this way

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.700
 moment I congratulate then Minister Tereza Cristina and Geraldo do

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.840
 INCA Geraldinho from INCA also gave nabhan, right, nabhan Garcia, who [ __ ] the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.540
 video there briefly squeeze our environment President is also almost articulation

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.030
 these rural producers now have access to finance to increase

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.560
 your protection is also a really great joy

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.459
 This is already the case in Goiás and Bahia doing the same thing, some do not value it there

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.719
 you can see how long Jorge has not heard of MST invasions

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:18.680
 when you attack in that direction giving dignity to these people she comes across like

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.799
 of movement the others many people lived imprisoned next to parties so

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.090
 who used that person to invade property ended up land invasion

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.049
 were ten years old in the last two years that lasted a few days

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.390
 some even a few hours exactly because of that we

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.600
 and ends up giving a month, right, and dignity to these people who were used with masses of

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.680
 maneuver of political parties and the past there

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.200
 a very big controversial milestone is made when raising consumption over

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:01.250
 hydroxychloroquine is manufactured the most spent it was the day of the invitation it wasn’t just

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:09.739
 the kitchen there, other diseases continue, it is only with a video that malaria continues the

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:15.859
 lupus continues we have here on average here 200,000 cases of malaria in Brazil

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.940
 I don’t know how many pills a person takes to cure Malaria It’s a lot

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.860
 people in the Amazon region take preventive production I believe not

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.360
 i'm sure it's in the house three and a million pills a year EA lasts the

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.150
 useful life right to validate this denial four years Nobody is doing anything

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.410
 wrong throwing it away now there is the personal alciley treatment there are people who

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.310
 do not want to understand that there are a lot of doctors who use

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:48.160
 This is hydroxychloroquine ivermectin is setra for early treatment so

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.730
 there was a higher consumption of it, so was I. What problem did I take now

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:00.370
 curiosity, right? The Regional Medical Council of the Federal District published

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.080
 a resolution the goal of protecting doctors prescribing medicines

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.700
 off-label then the class of the invite the doctor in agreement with the patient

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.870
 speech does not have the remedy yet scientifically proven for that but

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.270
 we have observations and studies that if you take this type of medicine now

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:28.510
 you can insure we cannot deny the doctor the fileme treatment which is

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:34.240
 also known with out of the bull the curiosity here right

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.210
 today I am going to talk because there is a research the research of USP Brazil

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:50.080
 leads home and depression in quarantine good so 63 percent the country leads that

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.250
 have more credit on cell phones are 63 percent and depression 50 does not have is the

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.980
 one of the side effects of staying at home is that feeling of fear that

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.390
 it was placed in the house of people's heads you are going to die I don't leave the house

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:09.370
 you're going to die you can't deal with a serious thing here the thing for us

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:15.250
 You will stay at home until how long then I have an account to pay you

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.480
 soon we will have I don't want to talk here because this officer will have

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.800
 Marco also read a survey on the amount of suicide in Brazil by

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.980
 cause of this policy stays at home used right to be politically redundant

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:37.070
 this collection of rivers the kills virus we regret death we regret it + 200000

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:44.000
 it is but we have to live back there I always said here we have two problems o

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.600
 viruses and jobs jobs still exist in Brazil and especially there

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:56.390
 among informal ones across 40 million people so along with the

00:06:56.390 --> 00:07:03.620
 price of the chamber and the Senate the Economic team we are studying there to extend the

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.970
 emergency aid for how many months three four months is not defined

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.630
 even what the value is not defined now is something that has

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:17.990
 hurry has to be from March and we need we need and we will do the

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.390
 possible to serve the population now the ideal is to return to normal employment

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:26.920
 understand the skin there the state and municipal authorities that although

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:33.080
 few states, right, or municipalities are adopting this policy of isolation from that of

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.050
 stays home so the economy picks up we should

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:44.819
 is older and those people who have certain communities now Maybe right

00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:49.319
 almost right tomorrow I do a video conference Mr Benjamin Natalie to the

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:57.180
 Prime Minister Israel which issue is being developed there and the final phase

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:02.129
 medicine to cure it Invite me that I didn't say medicine back there I took it to

00:08:02.129 --> 00:08:06.389
 each he hit me ok he doesn't want Maria Massena entered the vaccine pile

00:08:06.389 --> 00:08:11.580
 right, the guy who enters the vaccine line only the vaccine or is a useful ***** that we

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:16.680
 we must have several options that those who are contaminated do not help vaccine

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.530
 people who think it's no use who has to contaminate is no use

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:24.000
 vaccine who has to be contaminated has to go to early treatment

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.889
 see a doctor to see if I get a suggestion for you and how a thing

00:08:28.889 --> 00:08:32.690
 he will say we don't have a medicine yet to deal with it

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:37.700
 and we will not have this one maybe here and very expensive it’s serving it doesn’t have

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:42.590
 scientific evidence Just like vaccines do not have a certificate

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:47.060
 definitive is also not in the same situation as this other remedy is going to have

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:52.720
 it works in many cases and the guy takes it or doesn't take it now It’s a spray

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:58.580
 that we are meeting is already settled right I do it right that can

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:04.010
 doesn’t happen right but the virtual meeting between me and Benjamin is already set

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:11.870
 Nathaniel to talk about is this new spray that is used for at least

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:17.610
 even less experimentally, the person is in a serious condition

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:25.040
 I love you Poxa will wait without disturbed Ah and by coincidence This is the

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:32.120
 developing a drug to treat and ovarian cancer called ex SUS and

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:40.490
 of 24 points 29 and apply in Opa exons and 24 applied in 29 patients lawyer

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:47.180
 all have recovered so the tremendous news I hope it is be is

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:51.470
 really effective direct to the treatment of the kitchen a question to

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:58.820
 you do you have a father a brother a friend who is there look will be intubated you

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:03.970
 will you spray him on the nose or not Or will he treat it like hydroxychloroquine

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:09.320
 because it also has no scientific proof so the world with this

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:15.980
 top treatment I take, right, called out of the package ends up discovering things ok

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:21.500
 I want here we are already working with our Minister Ernesto Araújo and with

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.360
 more people the model also addressing this issue

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:31.080
 with the hospital there in Israel that deals with the one that is developing and

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:35.730
 this remedy and if possible remedy If God wants it will work now what

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:39.480
 it cannot happen in Brazil as I said here from the Regional Council of

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:44.840
 Medicine from here from the Federal Wires cannot as some are doing

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:51.360
 criminalizing filebo treatment that wants to polish the doctor who might

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:59.730
 recent thing for those with viruses this is all over the world if you practice it and the

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:04.200
 doctor has a right but that the right I understand a duty to seek a tooth

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:09.740
 assisting this person has a disease, which we don't know all about yet

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:15.949
 she like kitchen 19 and he thinks here today has nothing if you followed followed

00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:20.779
 the protocol of your mandetta who is the poster boy for TV Globo you will

00:11:20.779 --> 00:11:24.110
 having to come back here on the day, shortness of breath to return with shortness of breath

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:29.569
 have medicine and then this batch Lembo may not give more results more you

00:11:29.569 --> 00:11:35.329
 going to be intubated and the index of people who lose both base concept life is

00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:39.110
 too big will say to that these people who want to criminalize off

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:42.139
 I remember you have to have the courage to say that I’m saying it’s a blow

00:11:42.139 --> 00:11:45.860
 all the time but I can’t go worrying about it I have to seek

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:51.939
 alternatives and transmits the population that the world and here in Brazil we are

00:11:51.939 --> 00:11:58.279
 looking for alternatives to the kitchen 19 So if God wants tomorrow the

00:11:58.279 --> 00:12:01.670
 meeting with his Benjamin Nathaniel to address this issue and I

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:07.230
 I want to bring it here. Obviously bring it here to get the documentation from at

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:14.990
 and let me know that I’m not going to do it here Okay, Avisa acknowledged that there is

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:22.050
 really the per city heals that the side effect is infinitely small we

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:26.350
 we will authorize this spray here in Brazil

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:33.100
 the idea the old man has already filled your father if he was serious These buildings are

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.790
 explosion of Brazil you think here passes or not you will not be more he will be

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:40.920
 you you best spray Monalisa not

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:46.790
 continuing here look And now there is a new news is not

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:52.399
 proven everything is still not proven the use of hydroquinone in

00:12:52.399 --> 00:12:57.500
 fogging information that arrived here is lacking a proof of fashion our

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:04.490
 part but the reports are that a few hours or the person who receives nebulization

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:11.810
 of toxin would feel relieved and go looking for logically only one person

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:18.260
 an information but it is a sign that there are people who are really concerned with this is

00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:22.910
 doctor and have courage ok it's not just stay at home with feeling short of breath

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:28.790
 come back to you, you bar there with all due respect I think I think you know

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:32.180
 this is not the right way and make it very clear to the doctors watching me here

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:39.500
 now since some have an idol diet If it were up to him the valid king is

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:44.490
 it would have been practically automatic everybody he wanted the

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:50.370
 What is private is also applicable to the revalidation test, you know that

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:55.170
 it could happen i vetoed that device the mandetta went to work

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:59.100
 to overturn the veto against it I heard that it works to overturn

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:03.810
 cat later right I didn't even know it was on a night so called I would have

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:08.330
 called him to solve this problem and by four votes we cook by four votes

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:16.560
 to overturn a veto 257 the mandetta got 253 no Almost revaled him to

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:22.660
 private lessons to be applied to was approved there in bed Zé potássio

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:27.040
 and this is their contribution to medicine

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.180
 Jorge will talk a little bit here José you about increasing exports

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:36.430
 of fish Wow, how do you have the President taking advantage of Live here and

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:41.380
 congratulate all of our farmers are going to be crops from Brazil because even

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:46.870
 in the year and pandemics an extremely difficult year a year you know that all of us there

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:54.579
 we try even harder Embrapa is now published on the 8th of February the numbers of the

00:14:54.579 --> 00:15:00.449
 exports of the Brazilian culture of fish farming and we had an implementation of

00:15:00.449 --> 00:15:06.699
 4.4 percent compared to 19 increasing here our fish scores ok

00:15:06.699 --> 00:15:11.230
 except if this is increasing we are Our tilapia and mainly

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:16.480
 tilapia is of very good quality the the american is especially also states

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:21.699
 United has received a lot of tilapia and approves of its quality

00:15:21.699 --> 00:15:25.839
 I'm from the Ribeira Valley created a book and Eldorado Paulista used to take Acará

00:15:25.839 --> 00:15:29.480
 a little wand in some the little one I ate yesterday

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:34.370
 guy is the tilapia is they are cousins ​​brothers will go back there wasn’t that

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:39.860
 very big not 300 grams at most expensive brand passes mine That's aunt

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:46.040
 Lap the aunt there that she has undergone genetic evolutions just like the chicken

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:51.650
 so for sure these tilapia today weighing 1kg and 900 grams They have been going through

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:55.880
 genetic improvement What is Union water concession what is that

00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:01.820
 president we for example we have 73 hydroelectric lakes that today produce

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:06.710
 energy for our country and there are farmers who want to

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:11.480
 use that space to produce fish then we as a Union

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:16.370
 Secretariat of aquaculture and fisheries grants a space a piece there of that

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:21.470
 water for our farmers to produce in fish on those lips of

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:27.400
 drastic was asking here is an area of ​​a water slide a

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:34.050
 100% hectare produces 10 to 15 tons of tilapia per year according to Embrapa

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:40.030
 that within that same area are compartmentalized cage increases the em

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:46.390
 how many times 10 up to 100 tons per year brakes 150 tons gives to

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:51.820
 imagine i want to have a small hydroelectric plant logically can

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:57.180
 be bigger than your water depth or help here are always ok one is it ok

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:04.780
 You can produce 100 tons of cans a year Imagine how he can see it

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:10.120
 right, sell there in your region a hundred tons for help me guys you

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:16.530
 entered the pan of how many of the 03 all 300 kg a day together this account then you

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:21.160
 do the math right there, how many kilos ran away from the fish and you are a

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:27.110
 your dream there I do not hinder us to practice

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:31.279
 fish farming on Lake Itaipu How is the negotiation with Paraguay

00:17:31.279 --> 00:17:35.149
 president all movements within Brazil we have already done with the Ministry

00:17:35.149 --> 00:17:38.480
 of the environment the ministry of foreign relations with Itaipu

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:45.200
 binational on the Brazilian side is on the side there for the Brazilian What

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:51.620
 what is missing is how there is a prohibition in Paraguayan laws we are

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:55.759
 waiting, calm down the academy a little bit with Minister Tereza

00:17:55.759 --> 00:18:01.159
 Cristina together with Minister Ernesto Araújo, we are going to Paraguay to do

00:18:01.159 --> 00:18:04.879
 this conviction because today Paraguay is practically zeroed and

00:18:04.879 --> 00:18:10.100
 fish production and they will be able to produce 200 thousand tons because the

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:14.570
 total production there are 400 thousand tons of 200 thousand for the Brazilian side

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:18.980
 200 m Paraguayan side, that is, besides us, it has already produced energy

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:23.700
 wonderful that Itaipu we can produce food for all our

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:28.830
 and Paraguay can eat fish, see you by call, all control with all

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:34.889
 sure ok it did the math there is about 300 a small lake of one

00:18:34.889 --> 00:18:39.360
 hectare of a pch can produce about 300 kg of fish per day

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:44.429
 wonderful as hell hem as hell And of course it costs How it is

00:18:44.429 --> 00:18:48.299
 that the feed of Brazil is consuming increased fish generation President the

00:18:48.299 --> 00:18:53.250
 Stock unions have now reported a 10 percent increase over 2020

00:18:53.250 --> 00:18:59.220
 is the consolidated production I will I will disclose to you until the end

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:03.950
 February but sales of feed increased ten percent

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:08.870
 It naturally increased production and we estimate it with the fisheries secretariat

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:15.090
 Between six and seven percent of the end of the month we will confirm this

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:19.139

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:58.130
 date of a 4-year date but it is to start is always you take two years from one

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:52.230
 first half there in Alcântara in Maranhão wins the population because the

 toll is over 60 retro month ok among other things here everything is wrong there

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:07.059
 inside everything wrong now it is not easy just you do the right thing is the

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:12.309
 my part of the part of what we put to work like Colonel Araújo who

00:22:12.309 --> 00:22:16.990
 recently left the Rota command, you know, working inside is a job

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:22.030
 difficult is the work that to fight corruption anywhere in Brazil

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:28.000
 it is not easy to fight corruption and it does an exceptional job within the

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:34.600
 Ceagesp when she congratulates you today Thank you very much Our is Our continence and

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:37.610
 when already you spoke if you have to change we think together

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:43.100
 Pedro was next to the cashier and he made a statement there and said

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:47.420
 I'm going to put the box that we gave 26 days after a Caixa bus

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:51.530
 inside right and now i think i'm sure it looks like there is already a theme to

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:55.309
 people here cell is not i'm not sure i sure more will time

00:22:55.309 --> 00:23:01.880
 find the time for the Caixa wire to be very active in this collection then mine there today

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:06.980
 I wouldn’t go unnoticed if it didn’t happen, you have to have

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:11.960
 at least the bus was using it inside as well since

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:16.160
 we talked about buses for I went in your backpack but I will not deny information

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:24.410
 for you end of January we had 700 the tithing prisoner last Monday

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:32.270
 another 13 cents and it looks like they’re going to have even more adjustment because the price of

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:36.530
 oil is rising abroad and the dollar does not fall in Brazil

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:42.710
 what I’m doing on my part of has Ali we have federal taxes and

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:50.060
 states, in addition to more profit from the Poço ones, as well as the profit also from the

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:55.610
 distributors have four we have a fuel price and there are four

00:23:55.610 --> 00:24:03.860
 people there for the truck owner's neck so for example I can't

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:10.670
 Federal 2012 does not fuel us and such Cid Cid is zero Cid a09 we do not charge

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:17.600
 nothing in the diesel in the alcohol in the cooking gas and don't want to see the action duty we

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:23.750
 we charge then on gasoline 10 cents so pretty ten cents above

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:30.170
 five reais in the posts represents a lot for 10 cent has another tax

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:36.540
 Federal called PIS cofins in diesel is 35 cents here in ok

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:44.550
 today I'm going to tell you about gasoline is salty 79 cents each liter 79

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:53.220
 penny if you boot Elite's to pay 7/98 reais right Redondo here boot

00:24:53.220 --> 00:25:00.930
 they r $ 8 it's hard to hear our federal tax on the album stuck the PIS

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:07.280
 cofins of blocks of 24 cents in the gas that the housewife uses at home, right

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:13.600
 sixteen cents an average is at 90 the Federal tax on the LPG

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:20.110
 and it's almost imperceptible sixteen cents on an average of 90 reais then

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:25.450
 do not manage to see folks i will start publishing here the price of the cylinder of 13

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:30.640
 Kg How much three gas costs here at the new refinery so let's say there at

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:35.860
 refinery ok not everything comes from there seeing the gas seeing the good Avon products well suppose

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:40.630
 that you’re going to assume it’s a refinery at the refinery Okay and you’re going

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:48.340
 know how much does this state tax charge that the ICMS the profit margin and

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:52.750
 also the distribution then the wholesale kitchen gas is ok but if I don’t

00:25:52.750 --> 00:26:00.850
 mistake the price of 13 kg a day is below 40 reais the price there ready for the

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:06.660
 distributor pick it up and distribute it Okay it's under 40

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:11.130
 this will tell you who is wrong if someone is wrong and where

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:14.860
 is that you can press to decrease the value of that there

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:21.670
 and the most important thing here we can charge up to 46 cents per liter

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:28.150
 of tithing and we charge 35 cents since we assume we don't

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:35.020
 we increased the price of PIS cofins and quite the contrary I want to reduce this

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:39.280
 value of that 35 cents now a project that was to be presented today is going

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:46.840
 be tomorrow the economy has delayed what we want we intend nothing more than

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:55.330
 that to regulate a constitutional amendment of formil That is to 20

00:26:55.330 --> 00:27:01.780
 years has an amendment to the condition which is number 33 which is not regulated which

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:07.260
 that the amendment this amendment thing there and it is up to the complementary law

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:12.660
 and define the fuels and lubricants on which the tax

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:20.640
 will focus only once the only time has no double taxation let's

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:24.030
 get there good so what happens what does the

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:28.650
 ours we intend here the project is ready the opinion of the economy is missing

00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:33.470
 the other Ministry I was given an opinion when it delayed me it is common economy

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:38.610
 delaying these opinions is common but tomorrow that opinion has to be ready

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:43.000
 but I had to bring it to Rever here that we want as a project

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.710
 I'm talking language for everyone to understand here to see if he has Joice

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:51.970
 you will understand has a farm council confides

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:58.930
 today we want to make the decline in what percentage you

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:09.550
 and will focus on the fuel liter or the fixed value in reais that

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:15.840
 will that will appear for each fuel line as ICMS

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:22.570
 So this is good to suppose Dido let's suppose confaz will say look it will be

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:28.690
 charged a percentage on top of the book comes from the liter of the refinery or the amount

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:34.000
 fixed on top of the liter of fuel sold at the gas station in case they are

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.480
 talking about tithing in a second moment and the governors will decide

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:45.870
 with their respective representatives How much is that percentage or what is the value

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:50.850
 fixed over the river has no interference from me anybody nor a

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:55.000
 governor to lose revenue and he will say

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.530
 the final report of the line that my God will propose with their

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:06.550
 representative I want the liter of gasoline to be charged 50 cents here

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:16.360
 cms or as much as 30 40 50 10 20 percent per cent of the price of diesel in the

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:23.530
 would refine something wrong this what we don't want and even this is

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:28.840
 being something that can be discussed in court that what you do here from 15

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:32.530
 days nowadays it takes this average fuel value and then I'm city councilmen

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:37.630
 apply the PC on top of here so that he can get it before

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:43.810
 collection of cms So what happens is the ICMS tax not only on the price of

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:48.940
 fuel in the refinery most also focuses on the PIS cofins focuses on

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:55.010
 case of withdrawal decides and focuses on the profit margin

00:29:55.010 --> 00:30:03.230
 and focuses on the cost of distribution and focuses on the very

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:09.570
 and Neto to go crazy, what else is going to be

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:14.130
 there was a clan I hope that the Parliament approves nothing too much is

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:19.440
 a right for all of you to know, right How much tax is paid in any

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:24.870
 goods that you have will have more do not require you via port decree You will

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:32.340
 crash your car be it days and the aviation kerosene gasoline alcohol which is not

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:37.320
 at the health center, you will see there is a sign there, price on

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:44.220
 refinery Let's kick here let's go back R $ 2 price of the refinery clothes ok

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:49.020
 costing here i live in Rio de Janeiro the Manguinhos refinery to book the fine

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:54.120
 is any of this fuel is going through Dori there then there is in the middle of

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.750
 way you will know how much is Federal tax our

00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:05.640
 and the ICMS State tax the profit margin of the fuel stations And also the

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:10.380
 distribution course and you will be able to see look at the federal government is charging

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:15.840
 the state government is charging a lot to bring the fuel from the

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:20.190
 line so far is this price because it is not a table can the same post in Barra da

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:27.780
 Tijuca, you know, push Barra da Tijuca and there in Méier. It looks different, that's

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:32.400
 given to live now i will show a sign how much is it costing what Talita who

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:37.500
 I can do it you will talk I put 200 already gasoline my car

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:43.160
 And you're for example real mine isn't 50 real

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:52.220
 is the price the value of the tax of PIS cofins in the book R $ 200 was for was 5S

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:58.880
 1 liter you put 40 liters each breath the defendant you paid 40 reais the government

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:03.599
 federal is too little Oi and the state is buying 30 or

00:32:03.599 --> 00:32:11.830
 50 or 40 will have a heart it's bad to talk about Rio de Janeiro

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:15.990
 phone line if you have an account at $ 200 per

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:20.880
 example your cell phone your $ 200 called see if it is inside the other

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:26.530
 you know how much you're paying for SMS and I think you don't know

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:31.510
 well then try to find out let's see if you can do the survey here to

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:34.570
 show in some states of Brazil how much you pay semester your

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:40.450
 phone and you see here the governors union

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:44.860
 Our mayors we collected very tasty we still have many today we

 increase other taxes or create a new tax

00:33:27.309 --> 00:33:32.409
 and me We are dealing with this one because I think there may be

00:33:32.409 --> 00:33:36.909
 there is a cause of exceptionality for this we are could not believe

00:33:36.909 --> 00:33:41.769
 him in what depends on me I want to reduce the PIS cofins to a first

00:33:41.769 --> 00:33:47.409
 moment the home auditors will complain but it’s just that this time once

00:33:47.409 --> 00:33:51.899
 only you won't be able to because you want to if you can reduce the diesel

00:33:51.899 --> 00:33:57.999
 for the worse the beans you are going to buy the rice Whatever it is that

00:33:57.999 --> 00:34:02.769
 depends on road transport will arrive cheaper at the tip of my

00:34:02.769 --> 00:34:08.200
 you will feel it is positively this one I'm sure I can reduce the

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:12.359
 tax burden is the interior of Paulo Guerra he has been saying this all the time

00:34:12.359 --> 00:34:19.540
 we will not only administration but also do what we are most satisfied with

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:23.649
 among the population and he can see that he is paying less taxes really to

00:34:23.649 --> 00:34:27.320
 tax burden is what this end of Brazil is the country that charges the most taxes

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:32.210
 good and the least service offered by the population in

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:37.730
 in something further it only talks about PIS and cofins which is a claim

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:42.080
 there in our agriculture sector wants to take that one and they gained to hitch a ride

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:46.159
 here is heavy now just give a satisfaction to our culture bag the

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:49.700
 orange producers in Brazil there is already a bill that is

00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:55.310
 processing inside the right there on us commissions after sticking logically

00:34:55.310 --> 00:35:00.200
 then Minister Paulo Guedes Economic team will have to give us the OK but

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:05.240
 we have been working on this because today the President chicken is already exempt from

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:11.150
 pis-cofins or pigs already have conflict management and the fish that needs it so much

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:16.099
 to be promoted in Brazil, right? You need to have this isonomy so just to talk

00:35:16.099 --> 00:35:19.220
 people that we are working with the congress work here

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:23.330
 crazy let's go fight with the Economic team went to sleep well it's not easy

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:28.160
 it's not easy but let's try now we want to treat and lower taxes

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:32.220
 in a climate of tranquility and not a conflictive climate in Brazil

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:37.950
 Hi and people from the market, anything you talk about here, you get irritated

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:44.130
 on the tip of the tongue, right, it's just Vitória Shut up, I only if Brazil doesn’t have one

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:50.910
 directions everyone is going to lose you too so let's stop being annoyed

00:35:50.910 --> 00:35:56.340
 ok you are going to lead nowhere are you looking for solutions one of the way we

00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:00.270
 we decrease the price of fuel here is if the dollar falls in here But any

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:05.280
 I can negotiate any hole in the company. This market is irritated, you know.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:08.549
 just open the dollar everybody asks with that guys

00:36:08.549 --> 00:36:14.339
 and you know the critical situation that is in Brazil we have the internal worthy of

00:36:14.339 --> 00:36:20.459
 around five trillion reais is a pay you taxpayer pay a lot

00:36:20.459 --> 00:36:26.699
 to roll out of this life so what we want is co-responsibility to decrease the load

00:36:26.699 --> 00:36:35.999
 tax in Brazil well general bikes soon twin I noted here he ran away from here in

00:36:35.999 --> 00:36:44.969
 GM will invest ten billion reais in Brazil in São José dos Campos é and São

00:36:44.969 --> 00:36:49.140
 Caetano do Sul so it is certain this is a sign of confidence Here in Brazil it is

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:53.609
 sign that we're doing the right thing co-responsibility can't when it

00:36:53.609 --> 00:37:00.390
 talks about discussing for a few more months, right a few months, the extension of the aid

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:05.549
 in management, the market stays there behaving that way,

00:37:05.549 --> 00:37:08.559
 Let's give them a signal that we don't want this

00:37:08.559 --> 00:37:14.650
 the sun you know what it's like to starve you exam the secret session my a given

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:18.789
 moment I mention some authorities I spoke to They don't know that rice and beans

00:37:18.789 --> 00:37:23.619
 you know how people are doing out here when I stop

00:37:23.619 --> 00:37:30.069
 unexpected helicopter huh there is a mission on the way back choose a small village

00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:34.839
 a thousand people that people will talk to the people you know the

00:37:34.839 --> 00:37:41.049
 need that these people go through simply does not reach out in an hour

00:37:41.049 --> 00:37:46.869
 of necessity and we know that speaking and emergency aid is indebtedness

00:37:46.869 --> 00:37:50.210
 we know that Oh and let's do things with

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:55.780
 responsibility is on camera is the Senate The vast majority working in this direction

00:37:55.780 --> 00:38:01.720
 looking for a way to meet this difficult moment that our people still

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:06.340
 so it has some emergency emergency measure is not lifelong

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:13.670
 Because if the problems got worse, it’s a political issue to stay at home, this bridge

00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:20.240
 terror on everyone if Brazil does nothing to produce and start there meets

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:26.060
 difficulties what can happen in Brazil you can imagine I will not talk

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:31.880
 then I’m not even going to draw here Can you imagine him or does he have no history

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:36.680
 present loses like idiots I think it’s impeachment you have to put here

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:40.850
 in my place and after who he is and send him to show up here i'm going to see what is

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:45.980
 what he would do than we did what we are doing so far Where's the

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:52.590
 a slow there just curiosity is not a criticism yet a secretary of the

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:58.240
 secretary of and not health secretary of Maranhão right

00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:03.820
 goes to television and Décio the firewood of that lost the number of Maranhão here all

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:11.590
 the wood goes down on me down there like you if we hadn’t done the

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:21.450
 our part so the numbers for Maranhão have not only us this is not

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:34.510
 what I’m trying to confuse here is the state of Maranhão, which was the

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:43.210
 last year 19 billion reais money from the federal government 19 far away has already been

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:51.490
 bright 19 state of Maranhão that we present nothing for the

00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:58.520
 Maranhão does not have this type of criticism and it is what makes ours the

00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:05.060
 our fast government is ok so with 19 million in total it was the State of

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:11.000
 Maranhão is the one It will be if I catch it today in 10 seconds then I want the numbers

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:17.110
 right here in Maranhão So here it is

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:21.670
 [Applause] And oh my god I'm going to change this

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:26.230
 communication team here I will not change communications team here

00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:34.480
 for the love of god knows how to stay here I double I know ok ours even for

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:41.750
 mayor of the emergency aid mayor was

00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:48.160
 in the home of 12 billion reais money in the vein of the suffering people of Maranhão

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:54.440
 so we did it was almost 1 billion reais for the best 300 million reais

00:40:54.440 --> 00:41:01.190
 in specifically for ICU beds Zé Maranhão hair people have Above all the

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:05.750
 secretary says we're not helping where did that money go I

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:09.800
 I think I'm going to ask the Federal Police to take the next book already

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:15.920
 that it doesn't have and the money was given to where it is I said the goat of the plague for

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:20.980
 where did it go was this resource so here look

00:41:21.619 --> 00:41:34.099
 and it was 1.3 1300000000 exclusively for the health of Maranhão 13 billion reais

00:41:34.099 --> 00:41:39.740
 for emergency assistance is the state if I am not mistaken has lower income per

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:44.509
 capita State of Maranhão is not by chance governed by the communist party of

00:41:44.509 --> 00:41:49.279
 Brazil where communism grows is exactly on top of the misery does not want

00:41:49.279 --> 00:41:52.880
 can see the states more than in the highest income there is no parliamentarian elected to

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:57.470
 almost has no has almost nothing elected seems there communist party of

00:41:57.470 --> 00:42:03.559
 Brazil even so much in Venezuela Does anyone know how much inflation was in the

00:42:03.559 --> 00:42:11.809
 Venezuela is last year 3,700 percent he speaks the PC do B very connected to

00:42:11.809 --> 00:42:19.359
 North Korea but it also supports the regime there of Nicolás mature offense

00:42:19.359 --> 00:42:24.500
 la3700 percent me and even more the venezuelan currency

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:31.279
 lost 90 percent of its purchasing power against the dollar basically in

00:42:31.279 --> 00:42:36.170
 function of what is issuing currency and there are people in Brazil the candidate for president

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:43.220
 you keep saying that the moment is for me to put the machines to run

00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:47.690
 of the Casa da Moeda I’m going to put paper in the money square This doesn’t work

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:55.309
 inflation I take to God of the organization and the infraction is the worst thing that

00:42:55.309 --> 00:43:02.380
 is worse for the purchasing power of the poorest people so it's OK

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:08.359
 arriving something more often we create together as the

00:43:08.359 --> 00:43:15.289
 special social security and labor secretariat the INSS the federal police the

00:43:15.289 --> 00:43:19.750
 our Fishing Secretariat, right, and Caixa Econômica Federal, an anti-fraud group

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:24.809
 on the issue the wires so for you to have an idea just

00:43:24.809 --> 00:43:30.539
 in november and december of last year more than 90 million were blocked which

00:43:30.539 --> 00:43:35.759
 would be improperly paid to people who were identified there without the profile

00:43:35.759 --> 00:43:43.140
 to receive the closed insurance is an important thing here because there are

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:49.980
 obviously has to do with the price of fuel did you know that behind the

00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:55.950
 PT government, some refineries have been announced by Brazil around the world

00:51:46.090 --> 00:51:49.840
 mobile security that Brazil more or less approximately annually

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:56.740
 about 10 million reais and another 200 million What image 200 million is the

00:51:56.740 --> 00:52:00.670
 construction of curly terminals, these people received subsidized diesel oil at the

 bakery and received from doing what is now not used in boats right you

00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:09.349
 without speaking a name or going into details above it is only with

00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:15.829
 last year and it was overpriced and there was no use for anything low either

00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:21.930
 happen also happening and there are people who were condemned

00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:29.069

00:53:58.510 --> 00:54:02.040
 stay with you there

00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:11.100
 the late secretary of the past few months has soared the price of red meat

00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:16.860
 I would like to know from the Lord if the price of fish has also risen in the same

00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:22.290
 proportion in the same intensity as the fish prices go and this he

00:54:22.290 --> 00:54:26.910
 believes that with this increase in the price of red meat it can increase the

00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:31.200
 consumption of fish precisely as an alternative to red meat and became

00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:34.410
 most expensive in the secretary hours thank you the night which is the president of the

00:54:34.410 --> 00:54:42.090

 protein to fish protein the producers come to us and have reported

00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:54.180
 really that the demand for fish has increased a lot, right? And this is certainly

00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:57.840
 a way for consumers to eat better than eating fish

00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:07.059
 and also to reduce costs, you know, if you have prepared it Decides is the brown we know

00:55:07.059 --> 00:55:16.210

 Mozão in another case Augusto question

00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:52.130
 Hi good night Secretary Jorge Safe I was wondering if the government of any

00:57:52.130 --> 00:58:01.520
 helped the fishermen who lived from fishing in rivers affected by the

00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:08.320
 rupture of dams for example that fished in the Doce River

00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:14.020
 Hi good night Augusto Nunes excellent Question like this is in the Ministry of

00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:18.130
 Agriculture we did the working group and we charged the companies there

00:58:18.130 --> 00:58:23.200
 responsible for that and they are the continue even being is like a

00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:28.570
 part of the river you cannot fish you cannot engage in fishing activity due to

00:58:28.570 --> 00:58:34.090
 to the residues that were left there is chemical residues, heavy metals etc. So even

00:58:34.090 --> 00:58:39.790
 today many of these families are being harvested through this

00:58:39.790 --> 00:58:45.010
 companies and and work we did in the Ministry of Agriculture the hug

00:58:45.010 --> 00:58:49.030
 Augusto we are the oldest today here I am here you are older than day

00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:53.880
 that day by day we get older as a team, right? We are going to be born

00:58:53.880 --> 00:59:01.840
 although the world even older that I am with 65 several of the activities

00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:07.900
 urban areas on account of politics from brass would be the case of

00:59:07.900 --> 00:59:14.440
 incentive for the absorption of labor is from the Fisheries sector, which is a less

00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:20.910
 target and say safer on the issue of the academy obliged to

00:59:20.910 --> 00:59:27.990
 the goddess Fiuza Fiuza great pleasure is talking to you with you is the

00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:32.190
 fish farming especially Fishing not because we have sustainable limits

00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:37.650
 we can’t do fishing any more than we’re doing so

00:59:37.650 --> 00:59:41.850
 fish farming is a great Brazilian potential for you to have an idea Fiuza only

00:59:41.850 --> 00:59:46.770
 in the Lakes of our hydroelectric dams, according to the national water agency, we

00:59:46.770 --> 00:59:51.810
 we can produce 4 million tons of fish per year four million per year

00:59:51.810 --> 00:59:56.940
 and currently we haven't even reached 800,000 so imagine how many people

00:59:56.940 --> 01:00:02.010
 could be involved in the cold chain in transportation industries in the

01:00:02.010 --> 01:00:07.500
 In short, processing is a sector It is undoubtedly able to absorb and we

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:11.940
 we have made regulations reducing bureaucratization President bolsonaro signed a decree

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:16.800
 in the past for us to congress also passed a law that we have

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:20.890
 really made it easier that the country that already spohr

01:00:20.890 --> 01:00:25.570
 pork meat for the whole world is also a major producer

01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:31.420
 of fish you can see the film right the wire I already touched on this subject here of a law

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:39.280
 state there in Rio Grande do Sul prohibited the fishing of shrimp in the two

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:46.360
 and my we were 12 months ago, there was a Minister of the Supreme Federal only, who in case

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:52.450
 that I saw eliminated left that law there in my people went back to fishing now

01:00:52.450 --> 01:00:56.470
 what happened before the shrimp is created Rio Grande do Sul I don't know why he

01:00:56.470 --> 01:01:02.440
 went down to the south for people to go it was fished by the Argentines and she sells it in the

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:09.460
 blue three Absurdos exists in droves in the federal government two was created in the past

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:14.650
 that police to create difficulties to sell facilities I have is a lot

01:01:14.650 --> 01:01:19.090
 thing to say but with the presidency to measure the words here but she a lot

01:01:19.090 --> 01:01:24.080
 wrong thing that happened for Inter and the most varied unassuming

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:31.619
 possible last save him save very good night president '

01:01:31.619 --> 01:01:40.840
 good night secretary looks like secretary in several fake fishermen getting

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:47.450
 that helps closed right the defense scholarship in regions other than fishing for

01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:51.290
 example here in the federal district and other regions i want to know if you

01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:56.780
 already had a fine comb there already identified these asphalt fishermen

01:01:56.780 --> 01:02:05.250
 who receive help from Zé Maria, pleasure to talk to you is yes

01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:09.710
 we are already done a job as I said here an anti-fraud group

01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:15.960
 that we released there together with the federal police INSS is the Social Security Secretariat

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:21.510
 and work, in short, several groups from within the federal government that used to happen

01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:28.020
 Maria is that there is no interest from the old fisheries managers and it is to fight

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:32.040
 this type of fraud the real fisherman he needs to receive the closed OK

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:37.890
 the problem that hit the tip 67 percent of people who receive properly

01:02:37.890 --> 01:02:42.839
 So we already have this group or fraud that only in November and December

01:02:42.839 --> 01:02:48.510
 Zé Maria saved from the Brazilian taxpayer money 90 million

01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:54.450
 Our expectation with the new system that we are going to launch still in

01:02:54.450 --> 01:03:00.940
 2021 is to really eliminate through CPF crossings other

01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:05.380
 the form of intelligence in the federal government is to actually reduce that number

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:12.160
 there it is for an acceptable number because today it is the biggest social security fraud in the

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:16.900
 world is unfortunately called safe-closed and we will fight and

01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:21.460
 we will honor our Brazil already husband but it is shot I didn’t say here that

01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:25.690
 are you Maria that the password to get us inside was with the respective

01:03:25.690 --> 01:03:30.720
 Governor this is not true so what are you doing

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:39.359
 I used to arrive in the communities, you are going to be a fisherman. But I neither know nor know here that

01:03:39.359 --> 01:03:45.450
 is earthworm will be a fisherman put and then did the political registration the password with the

01:03:45.450 --> 01:03:50.700
 guys the federal government at that time girls in the play didn't even know

01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:55.410
 that was happening and I get scared how Brazil didn’t really break

01:03:55.410 --> 01:04:02.849
 didn't go to space or to the hole every hoe here is a worm one not

01:04:02.849 --> 01:04:07.170
 I know which collective of worms came into my life as the best one is

01:04:07.170 --> 01:04:13.170
 a terrible terrible thing we are there fought against fraud that contains

01:04:13.170 --> 01:04:19.050
 Ministry thanks to God 2 years and 1 month with nothing of corruption here I spoke in

01:04:19.050 --> 01:04:23.730
 past, right, for my government, the car wash ended with the bludgeon going down to the

01:04:23.730 --> 01:04:29.760
 my grandpa doesn't have a Priscila car wash and the other one and the PF has autonomy tightens

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:33.720

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:40.910
 do and invest a lot of things caught a lot of people there Saying health resource

01:04:40.910 --> 01:04:47.130
 and operations with the certainty that not the most varied is possible and the Government

01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:52.799
