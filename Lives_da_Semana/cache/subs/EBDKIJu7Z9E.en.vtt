00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.070
 ie ii and there

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.940
 what has been made a spectacular prison should already be in rio de janeiro should

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.950
 be being assisted by the lawyer and the justice he follow what his way but

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:12.850
 it seemed that I was arresting the bandit from the face of the earth that justice I say

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.340
 I repeat, I was not on the run and I had no prison

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.740
 against him in itu by the mind if it had prevented

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.860
 lawyer i believe i believe his attendance any location he

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.820
 I would have attended and because I was in that region of São Paulo

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.680
 at the hospital he undergoes cancer treatment did not win the picture is from my door

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.869
 closed and the case of keila

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.690
 and the other important thing fake news is one more is the g1 since morning an operation

 search and seizure at the home of an employee of my son deputy flávio

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.070

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.470
 and then obviously hall spread this news for several hours until it was

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:32.030
 admitted in the small footer of the newspaper linking me to the case what our there

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:41.359
 at the press party in this car I’m sorry but it’s plastic right from the mainstream media it’s

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:47.150
 disseminate news of meaning and also said that I went to warn you in the morning

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.790
 intelligence system articulating to my particular sense that I have

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.079
 spoken friends that I have all over Brazil that exchange information with the most

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:01.909
 varied subjects especially those that matter is for our brazil or two

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.430
 fake news is my home and see first

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.800
 closed a person who takes care there clean comes out of stone from time to time observe

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.780
 sleeping there was also not my home that suffered personal search there by the

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.690
 river civil police and state prosecutors have nothing federal

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.040
 and I do not answer for what I know nor does a son of mine answer any process in the

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.280
 federal justice the before the federal police same thing

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.750
 we are not yesterday the harvest plan 2020/2021

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:46.190
 and any country in the world has a permanent objective of its security

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.110
 food and in the country a lot that is missing you have to get around with the

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.209
 when food is lacking it complicates the situation so all over the world all the countries of the world

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:03.730
 world seeks in its food guarantee let's say so and Brazil

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.800
 produces food for approximately one billion people so we are a

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.050
 giant in important food exports to the world and the whole world

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.150
 which is to diversify the countries that seek food like that was at the exit in the region

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:26.940
 das and nothing the goal of relief region of japan

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.330
 south korea and other countries as well that we type all countries want

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:38.520
 business with us nor we are a power in the in the position reduces cowboys

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.750
 agribusiness in particular and teresa cristina our minister is a giant

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:51.509
 at that time an agreement the very good we filmed the past and obviously the

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:57.270
 the economy is also interested in investing in agribusiness, ours is very big that

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.680
 I have a return is practically guaranteed because the world doesn't let him

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.220
 eat and the world grows approximately 60 million more per year

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.069
 of inhabitants so there is always a growing search for food and remembering

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:19.860
 fine reaching eight billion inhabitants eight billion then in the

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.069
 space for more or 11 years ago I world has grown in

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:32.629
 ratio of 1 million inhabitants in gives me the scary number hit and the

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:41.539
 food industry, right, agriculture is laughter all over the world and in my next

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:50.009
 where even the company's mail is all that is said and talked about the past is is

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:57.719
 is as they say here is not democratic so i mentioned that ours our

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:03.419
 agriculture grew and changes from 72 when it was created is ungrateful I said

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:10.249
 already made a serious mistake I said that the president in 72 lt blue bottle messi

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:15.149
 just like the time ago the father of the free zone of manaus was created the government

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:21.270
 white castle and also ours our stuff that went from 12 miles to

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.539
 200 miles if I am not mistaken the 70s in the government emílio garrastazu Médici

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:32.399
 this is how they graduate from the military there is always criticism you have to speak the

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:35.569
 things that were not very good that happened in that period that any

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:42.229
 regime happens things you didn't take them now it looks like you have to hide

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:49.050
 I don’t hide the good things, I speak naturally without history, nothing more

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.040
 history the christ so congratulations is the government of

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:58.120
 just i'm not mistaken my god i forgot the name of agriculture on the straight of the name came up

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:02.830
 of him here later came the alison cole delhi but who had this idea is to create

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:10.810
 embrapa and even more send young people from the countryside to study poultry farming

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:16.960
 outside brazil they learned a lot they came back here and surpassed their masters and so much

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:24.100
 is that Brazil comes year after year hitting its agricultural production straight and more

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:30.130
 still said that the country man didn’t stay home and if he goes home you

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:34.230
 saw the people of the city of all of us know, right

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:41.100
 and if the city one day dies he and the countryside survive trying to survive

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:46.860
 the opposite emerged now, you know, the countryside dies and leaves the city alive

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:52.860
 for that one will also die then the man of the field and the woman also will not

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:59.760
 stopped producing work the issue of the virus did not arrive with this

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:05.600
 magnitude as it arrived in some big ones being from brazil again let's go to voice 5

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.590
 since the beginning I was saying that we have to worry about life

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:15.450
 so fighting the virus but we could not forget the issue of

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:21.710
 economy and we know the problem that we now have in large urban centers

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:27.750
 is that unemployment has grown there is knocking on the door and everyone the consequences

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:33.539
 and it’s about jobs and what I’m just not bigger than yours our government did several

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:38.880
 protection measures expressing small and micro entrepreneurs guaranteed

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:43.400
 then part of the payment of these workers in that company to

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:50.030
 and it was to continue to firmly get it right as well as other measures is also us

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:54.920
 we find out here that we call invisible are those people who who

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:59.740
 nobody knew it existed at the first moment we have 38 million information

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:06.920
 and we found that this number of informing we call invisible is in the

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:14.380
 home 50 million people a huge number we here every payment

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:20.560
 emergency which varies from 600 r $ 600 r $ 1200 which

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.390
 some categories are entitled to double

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:30.760
 equivalent to Brazil spent right you like it has to be at the post it's not me

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:36.010
 just not tasty about 50 billion reais a month so each

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:42.150
 payment of emergency aid is R $ 50 billion that marks the achieved

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:49.450
 it is worth remembering that one year of a family grant is in the 35 billion back home 13

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:56.950
 Bolsa Família benefits are less than a single one-month benefit allowance

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:03.490
 emergency was paid the first installment paid the second installment right and has

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:08.019
 the third installment is still very much complaining about the calendar

00:10:08.019 --> 00:10:13.329
 and we wish that everything could be very agile, but we cannot

00:10:13.329 --> 00:10:17.499
 forget the number and person name 50 million people who have some other

00:10:17.499 --> 00:10:23.800
 millions of people who are undergoing analysis we are entitled another one does not and this

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:29.769
 analysis is done practically manually so we are working on this

00:10:29.769 --> 00:10:34.960
 sense I see a lot of people criticize me the dark server within the staff of

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:40.420
 savings bank he works from Monday to Saturday in search of these

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:46.390
 which are fair right and we want to help these people who

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:52.750
 they were no longer facing difficulties in informality and now 600 aid gives

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:57.190
 to make a purchase of the month I know that the person will not eat very well

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:02.950
 because you are going to buy with money money is short but it helps until you don’t

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:08.140
 we will have social problems in brazil now we need da

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:14.140
 everybody's collaboration so that if the third installment was paid

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:18.400
 it is but there will be no problem ok we intend to have the fourth and fifth

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:26.200
 also some installment I think it has to be R $ 600

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:31.300
 debt is huge right yesterday we lowered the Selic rate we didn't

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:37.300
 central bank, i only know after the copom meeting ends

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.660
 the operation owing two point 15 percent

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:46.959
 I never dreamed of in Brazil it has a Selic rate with this percentage is not good

00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:54.040
 back to with holders fixed at most 12 per cent the selic rate after

00:11:54.040 --> 00:12:01.029
 by amendment with are withdrew the sixth out and arrived without another government gives 50 60

00:12:01.029 --> 00:12:05.379
 percent ago you would have to imagine the size of the indebtedness of the

00:12:05.379 --> 00:12:09.850
 Brazil over the interest rate because it used to be at that time, you know, fighting

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:16.269
 then inflation, the increase in the dollar simply by increasing the interest rate

00:12:16.269 --> 00:12:21.939
 accuse almost automatic there problem have a little time here I don't understand almost

00:12:21.939 --> 00:12:26.529
 nothing in the economy economy despite the problems the world faces in brazil

00:12:26.529 --> 00:12:31.300
 also goes very well on the direction of paulo guedes de roberto campos banco

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:36.000
 central and is from pedro in the ruby's economy box

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.259
 at the bank of brazil ok we do our best with regard to economy efficiency

00:12:42.259 --> 00:12:48.870
 says adjust everybody only and when inflation is created it is temptation to reach

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:54.480
 special with the most humble proxy of those fourth fifth installment I see

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:59.910
 people of parliament the justice said it doesn't have to be two more plots 600 everything

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:05.220
 well but almost balance this way if we say here adjust our

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:10.380
 duplicate everybody will pay a bill much faster that calls for

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:15.420
 the governors and mayors, who are looking for an opening of the trade in

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:21.360
 responsible rational way and everyone has responsibility but Brazil doesn’t

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:27.060
 take it longer stay at home the country man didn’t stay at home our dear

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:32.830
 ms the world health organization is always there, it doesn’t come and go

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:39.820
 hi marcia protects us protects us is a quarantine so stay at home everyone is

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:46.800
 good now we are going to analyze the thing getting the corner we are not going anymore

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:52.990
 suggest guiding you to do research but then go back and then see the

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:58.720
 question of the so-so but that they not infrequently transmit the virus for 24

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:04.090
 hours later changed his mind completely is our ms leaving

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:11.560
 leaving a lot to be desired in this area, it speaks so much, so much in the focus of science

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:17.680
 team with all respect who have less talk about science is one knows two

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.670
 next right nothing is not going to see all the time it looks like someone takes

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:26.440
 decision something says suddenly someone who rules there that looks like it's

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:31.630
 that right, look at videos that are not catching up come to us like this

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:33.900
 done

00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:40.919
 I make it very clear once again the supreme federal court has ruled that

00:14:40.919 --> 00:14:47.689
 mayors and governors should conduct the policy to combat the virus

00:14:47.689 --> 00:14:53.939
 I with the president of the republic eat only what to send money to

00:14:53.939 --> 00:15:00.400
 states and municipalities is practically nothing more than that

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:06.350
 I am sorry the amount of dead we are time in the conversion of the numbers leaves

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:13.670
 many people in doubt still died of seeing put 2019 the competition is ours

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:20.450
 the theme statements from hospital directors saying that forty percent

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:26.450
 that went into there in the death in the cabbage 19 which things were not food

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:31.820
 with mobile visa this is very sad because the numbers

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:35.870
 often translated policies of governors and mayors and has to

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:41.110
 note the tip is from the line arrives in are many mismatched information

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:47.780
 we changed the way of counting hit this table nobody tried to make up numbers

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:53.100
 with a wickedly big video television there already had lunch has a

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.819
 here tidies up hiding nobody wants to answer not quite the opposite ok

00:15:56.819 --> 00:16:01.560
 wanting will show the real numbers for you to make a survey in such

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:07.649
 state such a region is actually woke up uncontaminated has decreased the number

00:16:07.649 --> 00:16:13.589
 of eggs has been decreasing so the academy has already been there to focus

00:16:13.589 --> 00:16:17.699
 approximately 70 using people is hardly anyone going from that region

00:16:17.699 --> 00:16:21.990
 goes against the virus what people who have already achieved immunization I will not

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:27.209
 transmit to another one ok this is the work of eduardo plazuelo over there

00:16:27.209 --> 00:16:35.290
 formula ministry is but the thing here some business remember

00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:41.650
 also that agribusiness this crop plan also has peace with the city

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:47.200
 resource for black family farming with the lowest interest rate is that it has already

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:56.740
 heard in that area of ​​2.75 a4 per center of family farming which was

00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:03.130
 the amount foreseen in the bag a that year and higher than last year the forecast

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:09.940
 also that we beat a record of grain production in Brazil so it's

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:15.880
 congratulations here all the people of the field and special here the lady tereza cristina

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:22.060

 earlier near the I said that when we finish there in the young pan let's go

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:48.260

 thank you very much for the hug this was yesterday that we will not talk here

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:10.550
 now is my provisional football life the flamengo team the board

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:15.680
 of the Flemish always came in contact with us wanted to change something to

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:20.330
 saving football managed small or less you know that a lot there is no way

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:24.530
 survive different from the palm trees flamenco nickname of the guild and the inter

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:30.250
 ok Vasco even tried so many others

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:34.620
 difficult about well how to survive in a way even more extra income I have

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:40.150
 other water programs or actions that I didn't have, so let's go yesterday

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:44.659
 football provisional measure 984 2000mp

00:18:44.659 --> 00:18:49.909
 and what happens cold makes the treatment of clubs more flexible with football players

00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:56.749
 during academic contracts is already allowed and light and at least 90 days and the

00:18:56.749 --> 00:19:01.789
 carioca championship presenting that I know how to eat starts today, right, the bangu and

00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:06.499
 Flemish value for me did not say that you have to see the issue of command of

00:19:06.499 --> 00:19:11.629
 today, bangu and flemish, today she went on for at least 90 days and now she started to

00:19:11.629 --> 00:19:17.239
 sum is for at least 30 days then ends in in 30 days so simple to do

00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:21.799
 a 30-day contract if you have 90 you would not be able to pay the two months

00:19:21.799 --> 00:19:25.879
 salary that ended in the carioca championship the regional championships even in are

00:19:25.879 --> 00:19:32.400
 Paulo that the engine its championships the greatest resource also has difficulty

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:39.060
 good so this is it will allow the clubs hired for up to 30 days to

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:43.440
 players people love you saw the photograph of rio de janeiro you continue that is

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:48.000

 make a contract he play football there this new contract rule is valid even

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:57.169
 the thirty-first of December if you are good at eduardão, the one who

00:19:57.169 --> 00:20:04.159
 we call it a state of calamity after back it was worth a thousand ninety-nine contract

00:20:04.159 --> 00:20:09.169

 example poster to see you raise the cup of palm trees twice world champion ok

00:20:42.289 --> 00:20:47.549
 come on an important thing in the provisional measure why I said bangu and

00:20:47.549 --> 00:20:53.309
 Flemish and not Flemish and Bangu is because it is not always p she said that

00:20:53.309 --> 00:20:59.549
 belongs to the home club the right to the arena whether today the chicken rules

00:20:59.549 --> 00:21:06.929
 Flemish image the bank of which television is the other social media

00:21:06.929 --> 00:21:11.399
 any that will transmit the Flemish game or on the track here the pizza is the

00:21:11.399 --> 00:21:18.840
 bangu right then this very important arena right that the tião conflict

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:23.309
 between some clubs right about that and this conflict lets you give up then

00:21:23.309 --> 00:21:30.260
 client is going to say here which tv will broadcast that game

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:37.530
 it is also their tribe induces by that provisional measure in peace equal to those

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:43.170
 spectacle athletes five percent of the revenue from the exploration of the

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:50.580
 audiovisual sports rights are a pay tv x5x neighborhood equally

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:57.000
 for for football athletes against watching the game of brazil presence of

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.940
 within recognizes the team is that it has financial difficulty and players is not

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:06.900
 this there the public some think that just because they play football without a salary is

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:13.170
 very good and in this game the Flemish is sure culture the bangu selling well

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:18.630
 that image right of a good collection and five percent goes to the

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:24.410
 athletes and shape he's like big rabbit next democracy

00:22:24.410 --> 00:22:30.350
 to see yesterday also to close I posted a story on facebook a lot

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:37.309
 dear people what happens the attorney general of the union he issues

00:22:37.309 --> 00:22:41.750
 opinions and once there it seems to be published in the official union diary

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:47.900
 has the force of law and stayed there at lingo, because it helps to reform the

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:53.690
 federal police officers federal highway police officers

00:22:53.690 --> 00:23:00.120
 civilians and the criminal police regarding the quality and

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:06.690
 personal integrality criticized me net that I forgot the military police leaves the

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:11.190
 market that the military poly has this right I have not forgotten is that it has

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:16.710
 right and another thing is not to forget ok is because the opinion of the lawyer already

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:22.920
 neither can he legislate he interprets the law judged to be precedents etc etc

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:27.420
 interprets everything and gives his opinion

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:32.700
 I am the one who decides the attorney general of the union and the work started then

00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:40.130
 lawyer andrea mendonça and ended up as josé levy then signing them i sign

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:44.330
 logically, the highway attorney also signed that the job was his

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:50.630
 based on the legislation, so these people, right, the federal police

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:56.790
 then federal highway civil police and canal police when retiring are going to have

00:23:56.790 --> 00:24:03.830
 to take the age for example already of the other servers so that he criticized

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:10.480
 I forgot the military policeman and already have this one, but let's see, right

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:18.610
 the same thing can only be I'm very thankful then thank the young pan here
