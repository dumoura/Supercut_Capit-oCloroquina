00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.650
and that 2009 is a good night Brasília Vinte e Nove de Outubro 21 hours delayed one

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.770
 because it was in Maranhão specifically in Imperatriz and São Luís

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.800
 is that the left Elisângela Nossa in a pound ceiling thanks for the time is

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.109
 right to our table in agriculture Tereza Cristina will say everything here look

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:46.050
 then Okay, the products will fall, this will go up on stage, I didn't know, I just wanted to

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.070
 three minutes to talk about politics when it's time for an election campaign

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.280
 Mayor and councilors I wanted to tell you the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.519
 the important way right I know that the elections that count the most Those that we

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.890
 we heard she was reelected federal deputy and i was elected president of

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.220
 republic right now your elections what else are we going to say heats up the temperature

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.640
 is a much greater concern and always almost always a polarization I think that

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.720
 Campo Grande Mato Grosso do Sul is no different, right policy update

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:33.119
 place and when the second is everything Almost the fla-flu right or a worker in

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.899
 with consignment Campo legal on this high began the carnival of Campo Grande

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.770
 there I want to talk a little bit about the police

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.970
 importance and a little experience, right? What is it to channel the party of

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.520
 people have a prank there that preaches gender ideology destruction of

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.320
 family values ​​[ __ ] marijuana release I had in the state now

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.850
 administered by the Communist Party of Brazil with all due respect is the second that

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:12.430
 almost all kidneys are brothers like us but administration of PC do B

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.709
 helps to deteriorate these numbers and gave Porto Alegre my brothers

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.420
 Porto Alegre the gauchada from Porto Alegre is a candidate for the PC do B

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:31.379
 ahead think about the consequences ok see what this party defends the problems

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.989
 that starting from the breeding for the traditional Brazilian family is that this is the

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:44.700
 right path believed Communist Party lacks Brazil beauty for itself If

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.900
 talk about democracy having a party like that what else asking me for a law

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.480
 was if you could do to end the

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.680
 communism there we can have a beer right think about 22 and a candidacy bed there

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.890
 that that the face there the current governor of the PC of the B Communist Party of Brazil this

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.930
 it didn’t work anywhere in the world it’s just disgrace it’s an appeal I make to

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.909
 Porto Alegre there I will not indicate anyone ok you go up to vote now go back one

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:22.329
 candidate of PC do B I think the end of getting well I can't do it

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:28.640
 campaign for Brazil we have Brazil to manage I don’t even have it in your car

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.740
 and for Brazil to do the campaign is because I couldn’t go on a plane from

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:39.170
 Air Force would not be able to organize security for me so my

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.760
 participation is very very discreet there I will not say it was even side in

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.800
 campaigns in Brazil but it’s okay discreetly I’ll name some names

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.630
 here some Some municipalities and those who have not defeated that candidate

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.640
 everything goes well And I know there is a candidate to get up here

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.080
 mayor will have a reaction from there but it is my opinion what I think

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.930
 may be better for the municipality and not for parties with all due respect to

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:16.070
 matches there was going to be controversial São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro and from what I think is

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.380
 a large part of the voters of these capitals and not decided by their

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.419
 Mayor and the worst you can give is to vote blank or not to put or annual

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.949
 lot agrees for sure is because if you cancel you’re helping

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:36.050
 elect people right

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:42.020
 a little model, right? This is even worse than the one you might have paid for

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.240
 so when it comes to councilor for Brazil São I'm just here with four names here

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.940
 just and quickly if you have any candidate for

00:04:50.940 --> 00:05:20.729
 alderman from Campo Grande to Edilaine Edilaine goat from the plague there in Campo

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:30.510
 Grande Roraima a poem there has its problems in which

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:36.360
 not a few are ok we have the lion collection to do there is complicated because

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.669
 Mexico indigenous reserves are playing I ask God to get

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:48.870
 solve the lion's collection in the face you see a step appears a problem but

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.470
 will get there if God wants the street is more of a problem Visa good cannot

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.150
 continue to be isolated from the rest of the world.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.070
 right he got there and good time i'm here with the candidate here oh i get there by macuxi

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:07.440
 right I call it mako-chan it's Denílson some is my name okay to authorize my name

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.680
 God take care, you’re using Denilson Bolsonaro 1038, so Boa Vista who

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.919
 can help with my candidate for councilor you who have more good

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.550
 candidates for councilors in Roraima in Boa Vista of this but I have a

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:26.350
 coxinha here you have bone bolsonaro Ok and then you in that there is no part to try

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:33.940
 and now it's a separate complication White the complication takes the joke

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:40.290
 and I've also known him for over 20 years and a person who is going to do a

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:45.910
 direct dialogue with me and the capital of Roraima o Denilson both

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:51.610
 her time put it hate site thanks there guys 10180 And this guy here from Rio

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.540
 de Janeiro you would vote for him if he was from Rio would come back remember i think i will

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:05.050
 examine What's good Carlos bolsonaro was one of those who did all the media for

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:12.010
 on the occasion of my campaign, he works, then sentenced to him on social networks

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:17.830
 it's my son, right? I'm suspicious to talk about it, so the bolsonaro case 10/120

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.120
 who can collaborate you have no candidate It still helps the case

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.330
 bolsonaro be elected who will continue helping me a lot here in Brasilia

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:31.099
 and closes it takes a hit on the company why Why does it help me if it gets in the way

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:36.020
 you will not pay to erase then bolsonaro case 10/120 of Rio de Janeiro São

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.379
 Paulo who would say guys said I was a misogynist what is it reminiscent of

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:43.280
 what a friendship in the church because he doesn’t like women, right? So I like a man who

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.930
 you don't like women or men here look

00:07:47.930 --> 00:08:05.509
 And then you take this train here, calm down, what do you think is sweet to give Jesus that

00:08:05.509 --> 00:08:15.240
 there was controversy with me there in São Luís do Maranhão and

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:33.270
 I confess that I didn't do anything to, it's nice and then you say hi, how are you?

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:40.190
 I liked Jesus, I know, I bought it in Brasília, right

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:50.630

 accumulate was also lieutenant in the army R2 served battalion brokerages in there

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:44.790
 Mansa, right? But this has to do logically, you're asking for a vote here for

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:49.160
 There in Rio de Janeiro we know there are two more eggs running

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.380
 I'm here with Teresa Cristina Our admission to Agriculture personal beauty

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:34.600
 have complained about the price of rice, right, by the day, rice has risen so much

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:39.700
 a sheet about the people is not ok I even have to help you here we have

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:45.260
 all of the hamas right from Agriculture But here are just curiosities

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:53.210
 and we have the last 20 years here, right, the grains produced in Brazil, which is 157

00:16:53.210 --> 00:17:00.200
 percent I took from you there is true the mother-in-law 200 two hundred and twenty percent of

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.250
 Dangerous Brooklin the corn one hundred and forty percent one and a half times the

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:09.170
 only eight percent rice over 20 years does not make up for the Rossa port

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:14.660
 waiting for the President rice in recent years it had a very low price had

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:19.070
 competition from neighboring countries and many people have to leave the activity

00:17:19.070 --> 00:17:25.400
 because there were losses, a lot of people broke it. It’s even rice this year we did

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:32.840
 a recovery plan is the rice rice plan is we opened some markets

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:38.390
 and what happened the pandemic came the rice producer grew in the same

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:44.510
 decreasing the area he had a great increase in productivity and this year

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:47.580
 we don't get you the rice input from Paraguay Na

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:52.140
 amount we had last year there was a change in habit in the pandemic

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:58.980
 and the rice we started to eat more rice and the rice has gone up

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:04.590
 price is that at first the farmer made money but today he

00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:08.700
 no he didn’t earn that price all the rice arrived no so we’re

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:14.100
 President living in the world is an imbalance it is in several and several

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:19.740
 commodity product prices as we call it then rice went to a

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:24.720
 of these we started to eat more rice the steel emergency aid also did the

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:30.590
 increase in this demand we talked in september we removed the import tax

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:35.550
 if it weren't for that, we knew the price wouldn't go down, but it wouldn't go up anymore, so he

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:39.630
 really stopped going up and today it already has a slight drop today I did a

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:45.250
 research in the Brasilia Brasilia supermarket which is a price

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:51.070
 a jump here in the pilot plan we have rice with around 28 reais the

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:58.090
 5kg bag that gives four and 80 four and a little kg but this now we

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:03.910
 we will have the New Rice Crop coming in January and then the prices will reduce a

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:11.470
 little not little but now So much rice is coming in from Guyana 400,000 he

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:16.330
 cut 400 thousand tons of rice I'm also using a needle now

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:20.410
 coming out of a little problem but the guy's is already coming, a little bit of

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:28.600
 Paraguay's rice in the PT government was more or less demarcated area name

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:34.450
 indigenous in Roraima shown in the sister of everyone's heart and this

00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:39.659
 demarcation encompassed the time that the staff planted rice inaction citrus growers

00:19:39.659 --> 00:19:46.059
 So for Emma, ​​who is self-sufficient, rice became an importer of high

00:19:46.059 --> 00:20:14.919
 productivity abandoned the area twice the size of the reserve mental state

00:20:14.919 --> 00:20:17.369
 indigenous and

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:25.279
 the national parks that right is really complicated the situation of a

00:20:25.279 --> 00:20:34.070
 then it’s healthy rice go for this now curiosity here in January we

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:42.890
 there is a new rice crop and about agribusiness there are people who

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:47.720
 business here secures economy Ours is a big part Agribusiness and

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:51.380
 it is not easy to work in the field of a person I have planted there in malachite a

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:55.970
 land of Tereza Cristina 30 hectares of rice from Barra is heavy EA Saturday and

00:20:55.970 --> 00:21:02.510
 capillary sunday with swollen because there was no way to play folidol

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:08.000
 eye of the broad leaf thin leaf were day i'm going to throw folidol and the grass in

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.159
 will come I was practically from zero to zero because I worked the same

00:21:13.159 --> 00:21:19.369
 a work donkey there at the rice plantation on 30 hectares, you know, curiosity

00:21:19.369 --> 00:21:24.409
 here I gave 20 years the production of soy grows on average seven percent to several

00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:28.520
 kingdoms the United States wants to know percent and

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:32.990
 we do not percent and Argentina do you think will go this year will fall to

00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:37.580
 production they are the estimate is that Deva should decrease the area a little and we

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:41.920
 we are there with a worrying drought that taking Argentina and the South of Brazil

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:46.280
 So we have a lot of political problems with Regina, you can also see

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:52.070
 Angola's problem in vote you returned from Communist Party the PC do B in Porto

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:58.910
 I am happy with the line that since Argentina took over this one, these people have

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:03.080
 to have noticed inside only here in Brazil right here Dilma Rousseff Cristina

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:11.390
 Mature Kirchner So it will cut and they Argentina is the country that has unlock

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:18.140
 the other most acute in the world there the element really beyond

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:22.509
 stay at home and the moment there was confiscation of property

00:22:22.509 --> 00:22:27.399
 and it gives a serious problem in Argentina we are in contact with the ambassador for

00:22:27.399 --> 00:22:30.849
 bring us the information you need to install a really mobile phone

00:22:30.849 --> 00:22:37.109
 Argentine economy is going very badly, badly bad and attending to the tool

00:22:37.109 --> 00:22:42.429
 regrettably Argentina left meat from that country further north there you know

00:22:42.429 --> 00:22:50.229

00:23:00.129 --> 00:23:05.889
 Elite there in São Paulo that the sound of vagabondage is terrified of Rota and

00:23:05.889 --> 00:23:11.739
 Colonel Melo Araújo is not a guy is Sectional took over on Friday already

00:23:11.739 --> 00:23:17.729

 reported to me we are giving him all the support for our part here to

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:15.899
 people make a good distraction that I'm here that I have to change there as quickly

00:24:15.899 --> 00:24:20.519
 possible, seeing the exchange of the entire exchange and carte blanche is the owner of Ceagesp

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:55.040
 what is not yet available at CEAGESP in São Paulo II

 brazil-paraguay customs we have problems we are doing this matter

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:12.820
 there's nothing here I said question let's assume that Mato

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:22.090
 Grosso do Sul your Governor or but judicial decision of you have to take

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:27.520
 vaccine to take tereré I think I don't think the vaccine is something that people

00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:33.010
 people have to feel safe to take the children we vaccinated but I

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:46.060
 I think it's four years and we don't even have the flu vaccine, not everyone

00:25:46.060 --> 00:26:01.970
 toma has a study published on the internet of and I

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:06.500
 the public here that hydroxychloroquine treatment reduced seven times

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:12.770
 well attended I had and also you will not have a day either

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:19.980
 to know what [Music] is really going to have

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:42.470
 health secretary of the municipality of Jacupiranga São Paulo

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:50.870
 and he other mayors of Brazil have asked me to take care of my health

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:54.559
 hydration here when I get to my social media that and

00:26:54.559 --> 00:26:59.330
 path to health It is only what makes analysis and decides what to do with that

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:06.260
 Jacupiranga order received then received the shipment quite a lot of masha

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:09.679
 you Piranga must have about 15 thousand inhabitants you can see I'm sure then

00:27:09.679 --> 00:27:14.450
 God’s secretary I talked to him a little while ago and he received it then she spoke

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:21.409
 who doesn't know happened received the e-mail and from the State Health Secretariat

00:27:21.409 --> 00:27:28.830
 sending sending him to collect the two dots well you want if it were me I

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:33.809
 I wouldn't return the plane, I didn't give a medicine there, which puts it at risk

00:27:33.809 --> 00:27:39.179
 whoever it is is used for malaria with which I opted for

00:27:39.179 --> 00:27:42.559
 hydration here at is simple among other things

00:27:42.559 --> 00:27:48.440
 and in sub-Saharan Africa below the Sahara, the guy with Lara who was

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:54.049
 muscle in the basal region as it arrived with malaria and socializing took the

00:27:54.049 --> 00:27:59.809
 hydroxychloroquine and held I think you are very smart to understand

00:27:59.809 --> 00:28:05.509
 that something was happening regarding the decrease in viral load with

00:28:05.509 --> 00:28:11.539
 that person who's changing me and nowadays is more and more

00:28:11.539 --> 00:28:18.230
 Túlio being that our routine reduces the number of deaths even more who takes nor

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:22.519
 goes to the hospital very much is to be intubated in the building at work Tereza

00:28:22.519 --> 00:28:28.429
 more or less you with the people she over 200 caught the virus none was

00:28:28.429 --> 00:28:32.749
 to Hospital obviously then none died seeing it appear it was

00:28:32.749 --> 00:28:35.869
 working from home huh what do you call work at home skin serious work

00:28:35.869 --> 00:28:42.570
 ROblocks work ROblocks I had not already picked up on

 I'm at home and died I don't know if she took it like that I don't know that there are people

00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:52.860
 that according to the communities right logically to these likes It can be

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:56.909
 that has some side effect I don't know you can't be but in fact the

00:28:56.909 --> 00:29:02.759
 was used she didn’t use She didn’t she didn’t use the alternatives and then appear

00:29:02.759 --> 00:29:10.679

 pano didn't even care about that even for you to connect a disc and

00:35:26.170 --> 00:35:29.770
 anyone over there to say that woman took more than an hour to be

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:33.660
 attended and everything will be resolved nothing today takes less than 1 minute

00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:39.599
 and often the solution is to seek nothing more. Asked to disclose here via Zap

00:35:39.599 --> 00:35:48.109

 people and now this here has to be fought

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:58.870
 people do not have to be with the little flower there is no such thing here it has to be compatible

00:42:58.870 --> 00:43:05.339
 is someone who does not support it then another person who is in God

00:43:05.339 --> 00:43:09.960
 and you may not even believe it Nobody wants anything to do with anyone

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:13.799
 that is yours here now get to the point of committing this to your city and we don't

00:43:13.799 --> 00:43:19.410
 married side not in several countries, right? It's from around the world, this one has a

00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:25.289
 constant c 100 thousand people arrive with great [ __ ] a person is saying here

00:43:25.289 --> 00:43:31.430
 mine here 100 thousand people are executed in deaths per year due to your party

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:36.319
 I'm going to them like that including obviously including a communist country, right?

00:43:36.319 --> 00:43:40.970
 that you know very cute that happens in there last subject here i will be fine

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:45.310
 Brazil quickly signed the declaration

00:43:45.310 --> 00:43:49.900
 against abortion EA in favor of the role of the family never existed in the

00:43:49.900 --> 00:44:01.120
 last September, 313 thousand new jobs were created in the economy.

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:08.170
 Paulo was going to leave seems to be right Paulo Cesar EA recovery very Stitch for

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:14.020
 me because you are unemployed you have to criticize is the one who told you to stay at home

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:17.400
 now and hasn't been has been ordering to stay in

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:21.960
 house Mato Grosso or not also had that not Mato Grosso side its economy Our

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:27.839
 is from Agro Agro or sleep or Agro didn’t stop the people from the field didn’t stay at home

00:44:27.839 --> 00:44:31.440
 work goes to work Imagine if you had not worked from home to home

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:36.000
 right and for sure the rice would not have gone up forty percent around

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:42.450
 but it wasn’t princess or I wouldn’t have rice for you to buy

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:47.770
 now they are paying the bill of stay at home the economy see you after that so

00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:52.450
 now seeing economics when I spoke back there has to deal with a virus

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:57.520
 YouTube employs the same right with the same responsibility and

00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:03.310
 simultaneously the company Têxtil Aline there the bill to pay and each time but not

00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:08.200
 so seeing that the country where it closed the least had the least knots is

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:14.109
 and I’m seeing I’m seeing a few here, you know, the chief executive of Brazil

00:45:14.109 --> 00:45:21.540
 outside speaking and adopt the look Down its boring again the madness I look for

00:45:22.589 --> 00:45:29.840
 and here it looks like something is weak Patrol swimming Recreio at

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:34.940
 times and your job is earning little

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:40.380
 now separate the whole of Brazil I think it’s not easy either don’t enter

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:48.450
 the regulatory norm NR we keep taking the state out of the pagoda

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:55.230
 of Who produces by reducing bureaucratization by deregulation so we have the

00:45:55.230 --> 00:46:02.549
 famous NS regulatory standards many have already been perfected right

00:46:02.549 --> 00:46:08.530
 example here look at a stationery shop in the small neighborhood here the

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:13.170
 leisure to sell snacks I had to buy a risk prevention program

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:18.220
 physical and biological chemicals and a medical control program this all

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:27.740
 packet of four virals we revoke the prior inspection there to open any

00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:32.870
 type of business even a small clothing store a stationery store you need to request

00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:38.050
 authorization and has a preview ended NR 21

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:45.580
 nr-12 work safety with machines and equipment the company

00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:50.290
 import a state-of-the-art machine for you that Beco to that machine

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:55.120
 Brazilian legislation spending an average of twenty percent of the price she paid

00:46:55.120 --> 00:47:01.330
 on that machine and sometimes make certain changes that made it configured

00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:06.970
 more productive is impressive and no one had the courage to change that in the

00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:12.829
 past and more that you mess around love you ask for her guarantee

00:47:12.829 --> 00:47:18.010
 G1 is well revoked

00:47:18.010 --> 00:47:26.740
 your regulatory norm bag this is my expense for those who produce and

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:31.900
 consequence more resistance will also sell your product cheaper all

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:43.590
 world take something there nr-15 this one is unbelievable unbelievable R15 1978

00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:53.219
 78211 there in São Cristóvão II ah and there are also nr-15 and the norm in

00:47:53.219 --> 00:47:57.479
 make open work feasible can work is open I don't

00:47:57.479 --> 00:48:03.199
 I know a lot to make this candle, right, but in the field, especially in the field of

00:48:03.199 --> 00:48:09.299
 entry to wash a car for example works at the gas station nearby so if the

00:48:09.299 --> 00:48:13.589
 maximum temperature of 28 degrees that almost in all of Brazil I think an average I

00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:17.060
 I think it's up and up I don't think so

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:22.710
 so every 15 of the work I had to rest 45

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:30.810
 to 15 working 15 weeding 45 under the water making the plants we ended up that

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:39.850
 this put for the love of God NR18 civil construction

00:48:39.850 --> 00:48:44.910
 and for example the bathroom that that you masonry

00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:50.610
 And if it was a board or a board, right, how many people talk, okay, now I don’t understand

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:54.120
 nothing from São Paulo the attention of Eldorado that put the cheap one of that of Eldorado

00:48:54.120 --> 00:49:01.470
 Paulista in the square on the side of the hug Tiririca then there is a gigantic work You

00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:06.040
 can even think about it now complicated works smaller right

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:11.750
 and now a chemical toilet NR 24 is allowed

00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:16.760
 Hi and the bathroom Look just a barrier of a company it was possible to give more than 40

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:22.580
 fines once just for example the roof it has to be of clay tile Or

00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:27.770
 fiber cement I don't even know what that cement is not going to have been is not

00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:36.990
 asbestos and wooden or iron windows And the new ones have to be incandescent

00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:42.410
 in specie was even the type of paint to be used in painting the walls and

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:49.900
 Ana only looks and if she had 15 workers she has to

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:55.780
 to have a male male bath and the poison is LGBT, you don’t have to have it well

00:49:55.780 --> 00:50:00.210
 who are thinking all the time and put everything we have to put us right

00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:03.970
 so I have to have been workers have to have a bathroom

00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:09.700
 male and female with all due respect, what if the company that has 10 15 people

00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:13.930
 I think if he has a shower, right, your problem opened the door closed for

00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:19.260
 inside That's it There it was revoked also we arrived

00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:25.580
 in the end there is the 31 that solved the problem of Brazilian agriculture

00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:31.100
 nr-31 of the safety and health of the worker of the work in the agriculture

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:37.890
 this presidency here is a revolution today whoever is in the field has a NR

00:50:37.890 --> 00:50:44.940
 appropriate for the countryside and not with the laws that governed the urban area then

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:50.700
 small producer of milk and cheese, you know, he had 10 dairy cows for example

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:55.530
 he had to develop an environmental risk prevention plan for the

00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:59.940
 operational safety work lasts every year every year you fall from

00:50:59.940 --> 00:51:05.310
 new nobody could fulfill it so this is a gain for the field

00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:15.130
