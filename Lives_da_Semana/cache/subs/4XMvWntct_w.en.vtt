 languages ​​last week I don’t know the pleasure that scolds

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:41.710
 first lady right then first lady properly and correctly warned me

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.070
 because I had to have an idea of ​​languages ​​I agree last week it was not possible to

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.670
 do that then she couldn’t stand by me

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.179
 it's because I'm not infected yet I hope God wants to stay free there

00:00:54.179 --> 00:01:00.900
 next days with another exam here is very light also a little quick i

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.840
 I apologize for that it's always good to have someone on my side to have the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.460
 contradictory is to touch on other subjects that have some specialist on my side

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.119
 right, how I wish our minister of structure had our

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.940
 captain tarcísio i will see if next week i have a good time and show up here if

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.009
 well I confess this story here very well get on my side today here the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.100
 message wages from the environment or evaristo miranda and embrapa is a

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.300
 deep man with knowledge of the Amazon region he is from Embrapa so it would be

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.970
 an exceptional person to talk to you so ask until the radio

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.750
 young pan ok guys we're watching i'm going out with you

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.850
 invited to take hope to talk about burning Amazon

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:02.909
 and environmental equations generally legal reserve one thing only exists

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.950
 in Brazil because this drop in information is easy, right? So we have

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.770
 problems because brazil the power in the lake business europe there is a sect

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.170
 environmental they will preserve nothing your your your environment practically

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.120
 nothing is hardly heard of reforestation in the region all the time

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.860
 active over ours and unfairly because it is a commercial fight

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.550
 ok too, in the past there was interest in the name of the Amazon region and today is the day

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.880
 interest all over Brazil so we are bombed 24 hours a day

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.170
 exactly is is not inspiration losing the information war is that part of

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.319
 video much of the media takes the time to criticize the same as ugly

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.530
 in previous governments that is still environmental heart in Brazil I heard

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.350
 say in fact right in the average heat seal and burnt there is a difference

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.110
 between one thing and another in Brazil we are below the average 12 in

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.780
 last years so it’s not that we’re doing well there’s something to do there’s boss

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.780
 this trauma all this stir that they do is how much Brazil in this

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:27.970
 question here so about heat alerts that there is the clip country is 90

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.870
 percent already happens in open end areas you will never end by

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:39.400
 the other side is also the indigenous, right, the native is the riverside caboclo he does

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.650
 constantly this is in his won where he lives and when it comes to amazon

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:52.150
 cool but I'm wrong your name status is nine states and a part of these

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.260
 states a large part of and now the other smaller part is not

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:05.239
 wrong promise where is the source the Amazon rainforest region and there is man

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.910
 legally on land eighty percent legal reserve nothing can be done but

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.160
 you do and we lost a few days ago here stayed with the provisional measure she

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.699
 new president fishing with the national band is works here on the side here

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:26.660
 in front of that one that was aimed at land legalization, that is

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:33.950
 today there is land and the guy is there knows that he is there all he practices burning we know

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.380
 this being cool is not cool you are often do not know there is no way to know if there

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.729
 but if you have these, how to regularize that area of ​​your body, use each body measure

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.900
 that the left still has a very strong force within parliament and I say no

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.340
 enters the house of the body that was left to enter into a vote if it had entered into a vote

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.849
 it would have been your voice and now then it was not on the agenda it was

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:02.099
 voting and ended up yielding the provisional measure to have this approval

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:08.069
 in these areas it has regularized it and once it has detected the satellite it does not

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:13.550
 hot spot or burning whatever you would have to know quickly if it was

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.839
 within the legal reserve or not and that the owner of that area and you could

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:23.399
 person without any problem as long as this doesn't happen pressure from the left that

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:28.019
 theme is despite that I admire very cool on the left in Brazil pt growing well that

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:33.059
 only the judge basically those parts come back often the network losing having is has

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:38.849
 power of another together on the bed together of the table of the chamber not to put to a vote and

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:44.999
 so then our we are all the time accused rightly and unfairly of mistreating the

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:49.949
 Brazil's environment and the company is part of the public press lies to

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:53.860
 In this respect, the company is able to see until it transmits what it

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.740
 and then I’m out there in Europe and as I said no, I’m the environmental person

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.580
 is considered a sect of that public matter there criticizing the Brazil of

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.000
 company that same press that published lies is diaper the number is right

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.349
 republic whatever it is to criticize it must be threatening all the time the

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:18.630
 government deserves close treatment of the environment

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:24.390
 ae and made it very clear here again here right ninety percent of these outbreaks

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:32.940
 of heat and she will dream already deforested is not a new example five percent on land

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:40.490
 indigenous is the Indian who does it for so much is that we brought not a child is

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:47.449
 and it is not yet foreseen you do not decree not allowed to burn by the

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:53.419
 Brazil all over for four months now I'll get you just here I know you're out

00:06:53.419 --> 00:07:01.280
 of this prohibition here the Caboclo Indian cancel but no longer this

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:07.220
 small is the man who is there in the interior of Brazil these next

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.870
 years the enormous that we have ahead it will have access to decree not as it is

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.650
 that he will cultivate something you do not cultivate this year this year there was no

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.240
 running next is more of a problem than ahead now what is missing for the

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.169
 day that the government can for all of us is responsible must to address that

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:29.470
 subject otherwise from brazil to continue being massacred all the time

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:33.860
 harmed in what is working here in Brazil, I take the business

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:38.330
 for us the locomotive of our economy I remember

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:43.309
 collective meeting in september was september of last year but i did a

00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:48.349
 pronouncement there and on social networks I went there already to see if you are now there

00:07:48.349 --> 00:07:51.740
 traditional media was criticized so I saw that I was doing the right thing

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:57.610
 between things I say and today in Brazil we have 14 percent

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.100
 and returns shows tagged with the beginning of the 14

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:04.630

 brazil government support generates girl i'm not paying anything i'm not encouraging to do

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:44.750

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:50.510
 campaign I only did some of the even because there was no pt standardization in another

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:54.530

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:44.240
 rural is what is working in Brazil is letting the sky also that approximately

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:51.360
 four months we exchanged the gift of porto de santos and for

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.380
 coincidence or not in the last four months the record-breaking record of

00:10:55.380 --> 00:11:00.800
 export I don't just get there the product right you have to have a structure

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:06.650
 so that product can be quickly delivered to ships and

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:12.660
 taken abroad then agribusiness not right now as everything is right just take

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:16.560
 nobody shoots neguinho is with the wrong stone other than fruit right

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:22.680
 hi and agribusiness being very good for Brazil there was no unemployment just

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.120
 worked in the field differently from the city where

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:34.520
 there are many governors and mayors of the fleece I participate look down have closed who

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:40.019
 will say you were right there will be history now the reality you remember

00:11:40.019 --> 00:11:45.290
 and when I spoke here in the back, we have two problems to solve

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:51.839
 in the position of life, right maintenance of life and maintenance of jobs and things

00:11:51.839 --> 00:11:59.160
 are married what that much of the bible do all the time hits me what

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.939
 that many people for me success made me up to the wall and see for the time

00:12:02.939 --> 00:12:07.799
 fight matter but it would be comment was personal saying right life you don't

00:12:07.799 --> 00:12:13.319
 recovers economy so look no one wants anyone to die from illness

00:12:13.319 --> 00:12:17.970
 none in my mother is 93 years old I would like

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:24.269
 and even more we know that the person at that age any problem here arrives

00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:28.150
 snow can get very complicated right

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:32.770
 and now the numbers are going to say to him mind has increased the number of suicide

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:39.550
 by unemployment, depression or other illnesses people who had problems

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:44.530
 more health doesn’t go to the hospital for fear of the virus so these numbers start

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:51.820
 appear and now the press begins to show what I was saying

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:55.750
 back so that when you spoke back there it wasn’t on the wave it wasn’t on

00:12:55.750 --> 00:13:02.650
 politically correct early alone against the tide is not an easy idea just said

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:07.630
 also right, he’s alone the world’s leading public that talks about it and edit

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:12.610
 back anything we have here now here I go here at the headquarters

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:16.520
 press the hair

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:22.490
 and here I’m going to round hard here not seventy percent of the Brazilian

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:29.150
 stayed until the spending could be cut spending left to buy some

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:36.740
 the second poll economy also seventy percent said they were afraid of the

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:39.070
 unemployment

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:47.769
 and I had in jaraguá avenida araguari minas gerais i'm training with this

00:13:47.769 --> 00:13:51.519
 week at the federal highway police station I stayed a couple of

00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:56.350
 hours there talking to the people the people just get to the other lane there too

00:13:56.350 --> 00:14:03.220
 pay hit me also was together making ring reaction setra and there ooa

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:06.910
 people told me that the number of pedestrians being run over increased by three in the

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:15.250
 track in the last two months here because then we say that we think it is little

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:20.320
 running over suicide is not proven but our feeling

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:25.510
 for the conversation with the family that could be for sure suicide the

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:31.510
 element catches the company is married to his son, don't you think losing black?

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:37.780
 there is also the informal one and what it said was right to sell right there

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:46.570
 cat barbecue sold one of gave the tea on the beach the male inside the beach is

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:53.410
 of a popsicle comes here home football city lose job and can't imagine

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:58.150
 suffocates him with these people wanting to sell work produce in addition to not

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:01.660
 to have on the market there is why it was also by some governors and

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:08.010
 mayors with struggles with prison look at the situation that we got right and then I

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:13.450
 I will appear the problems each with their responsibility I am not blaming

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:18.760
 nobody is here, the matter I'm always lying, putting out a hammer

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:23.600
 franciele and four out of ten companies closed

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:28.660
 due to academy four out of ten companies closed want to die more

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:37.370
 now you can even reopen the more will have to start from scratch again 1.3 million

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:43.940
 99% small business is that guy who had a two three

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:48.320
 90 employees not because everybody can you take into account here

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:54.850
 rounded numbers rounding please 1.3 million average four of almost

00:15:54.850 --> 00:16:01.339
 almost five million formal jobs lost here to

00:16:01.339 --> 00:16:05.660
 that closing five million informals looks at the problem that it doesn’t

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:10.700
 put it ah it's right in front of us right now let's preserve life like this now

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:14.660
 I repeat I repeated here I'm sorry he's watching here already ask when

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:20.470
 decided to go back to the flattening of the cross is the

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:25.630
 domain a diet right a boring the curve was the word of the night minister right

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:32.290
 example way i will pick up bodies on the street sowing panic in brazil the great

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:37.510
 the media also giving a very strong force, I’m home-made, boring

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:42.900
 curve what is the fall here and Brazil you stopped, you can

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:48.960
 that hospitals could care for the infected had no vaccine had no

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.080
 but I don't have a vaccine yet and we don't have any proven medicine

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:57.120
 scientifically we have not yet scientifically proven the objective

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:01.620
 to answer we are seeing several states left over bed thanks to

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:08.240
 God, then, that starting to open is because the crisis due to lack of jobs

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:15.150
 boat suicide depression is coming for anyone boss has to decide

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:18.209
 me and here at

00:17:18.209 --> 00:17:26.100
 the poorly made decision is an indecision decided to take yes look at the study

00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:33.840
 American here from the tank where the governor is not put the for 185 for

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:39.659
 percent of those contaminated are at home they were contaminated by relatives

00:17:39.659 --> 00:17:45.960
 home so some thanks rose touching that nobody said that nobody was going

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:51.840
 dying because of the color more so much kiko is dying unfortunately now I

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:57.370
 I will use I think auntie how to decrease the number of works divide as

00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:02.080
 to every day and are hansen that at least seventy percent of the population is going

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.910
 be infected don't take care what the taller the older you have diseases

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:11.530
 a good friendship and sooner or later that these two

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.950
 I wouldn't be on the day of being infected by the virus either. I have a

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:20.290
 reality is not that we are going to open it, let's leave it

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:24.940
 there is no problem with the ex, because years ago the carnival the federal government

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:29.320
 had spoken this problem year channel resolving to run loose I said accounts

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:35.070
 money for the state, right, this is more geared towards carnival

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:41.580
 now what happens we can't keep smothering the economy

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:48.120
 you cannot understand here the lack of salary the lack of forest and more than

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:54.090
 the virus itself is that it’s difficult, I’m wrong to say that then I

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.990
 I have to have more responsibility so that I'm having it I could stay

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:03.000
 quiet after all supreme federal court said that whoever decides everything in this

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.420
 healthy area was in paris and has still been p

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:16.980
 the capital of the colony is forbidden here, if you have no alternative

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:22.590
 because it is forbidden and has no scientific evidence to be effective but it also does not

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:27.270
 has proof of feeling that I don’t want to put what I don’t have like me

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:32.430
 spend very beautiful effective that doesn’t even have a reality now has

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:37.620
 a lot of people when they take my case the next day in their mouths left the

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:41.740
 symptoms ah and has studying was is calling now

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:48.790
 also favorable and your routine why cool has no alternative I will

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:54.190
 imagine in a while that will have scientific proof

00:19:54.190 --> 00:20:01.450
 whoever says what will get me those who banned their states

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:07.559
 forbidding their municipalities to use this one how many voices could be avoided

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:13.940

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:59.400
 I didn’t see hundreds of people and said the symptoms

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:04.049

 poster boy this one I'm not poster boy I'm not

00:21:37.419 --> 00:21:42.309
 encouraging you to take nothing will guide you to look for a doctor and see the

00:21:42.309 --> 00:21:47.980
 that he thinks that here and you decide then if the doctor said that you

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.510
 can take then became known with the Flemish is not the alkaline treatment

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:57.190
 out of the package even so we have no proof responsibilities now have to

00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:02.310
 take at the beginning in a previous protocol your mandetta

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:08.340
 it is certain that i could only see message only that i meet a serious and serious patient

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:13.890
 but knowing that it doesn't work, there was a study going on, I think it is

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:20.370
 under applied investigation an overdose in those who were in serious condition without percent

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:26.520

 no way I don’t want to take his place are issues until these four are

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:43.699
 so now they are effects and I will help me there in the course nunes that

00:29:43.699 --> 00:29:52.339
 usa usa and frau vitor brauer josé maria welcome journalism with exemption and

00:29:52.339 --> 00:30:15.139
 it seems that being exempt in journalism is being bolsonaro has nothing to do with the milestone

00:30:15.139 --> 00:30:20.610
 civil society and the civil milestone of peace basic element

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:26.999
 right guys we go some one from 10 to 16 very important expects the congress

00:30:26.999 --> 00:30:34.259
 keeps the object that allows the sixth makes it right without bidding stay for even more

00:30:34.259 --> 00:30:37.249
 30 years in this area

00:30:37.309 --> 00:30:43.830
 and I will generalize but you know that and that area there is a problem area in

00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:48.150
 many states and municipalities, right? So it is the private initiative that is very welcome

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:54.960
 now if everything went well you play that in sarah we would not have 100

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:59.940
 million people in brazil six votes and 35 million water

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:07.440
 we expect here not in the short term one in 10 or 15 years is practically

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:14.009
 so the problem is close to zero the problems close to zero wait for that

00:31:14.009 --> 00:31:20.850
 there is a very great hope according to paulo guedes we can have 500 m and 500

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:31.389
 billion access the billions of real investment in this area of ​​brazil and

00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:36.609
 the question soon open the oldest dry seam is back except it won't

00:31:36.609 --> 00:31:41.259
 answer question I will not want to worry is from your father, right?

00:31:41.259 --> 00:31:45.099
 I, people from that life behind a password cell phone, are waiting for the wrong word

00:31:45.099 --> 00:31:51.009
 ours he not to be staying after the first question bearing that the

00:31:51.009 --> 00:31:55.100
 first question that you are of what uses the

00:31:55.100 --> 00:32:04.610
 and then and even because it has to count

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:10.490
 in some managers and also justice well embargoed in some regions the

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:16.520
 reopening of activities we have also heard the speech that the country will have

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:22.730
 to live together for a long time the government intends to discuss it again

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:27.510
 supreme federal court the issue of freedom of the population

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:34.590
 to like the thread of rediscussing I would like ok the decision was of the supreme court

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:38.820
 federal if I am not mistaken it was unanimously that all measures

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:43.560
 relapses that fell solely on the responsibility of governors and

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:49.740
 mayors our participation is basically sending resources to states

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:56.150
 and municipalities this we made a country i will say afterwards it was obviously

00:32:56.150 --> 00:33:02.340
 our budgets was the country that invested the most in this one, I would like a

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:11.210
 government to participate is to give an opinion and suggest more account of the power

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:14.870
 nobody wants to give up, right, so we were not wanted by

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:20.030
 governors or mayors to discuss this issue now mayor often

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:25.750
 I wanted to open more than one decree of the governor so he was a long time ago

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:31.040
 in são paulo there are always several mayors of ours who were the governor of the corridor

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:35.870
 simply decided on the other crop subject, right, and there was friction between

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:42.260
 governor this between the governor and mayors the party itself now the

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:49.070
 dismantle the economy then unemployment is ok, it’s just we don’t have the program, you know

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:55.700
 of that uses in view of the emergency aid 16 real years big fourth

00:33:55.700 --> 00:34:00.680
 he is starting to pay the fourth installment now and we still have the fifth

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:05.880
 expects the economy to splinter back to and now the federal supreme court changes

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:11.550
 I hold supreme I don’t want to blame the toffoli days for that, right but we have the

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:16.950
 new president here that I that the fux minister who takes over september is

00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:24.330
 maybe it is with the new minister we can re-discuss this is the subject right is waiting

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:27.810
 that the supreme be accessible potion because we can all go wrong because

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:31.889
 that the supreme minister cannot get a human being like me with you like

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:39.060
 to anyone and I particularly didn't think it was an exaggeration for us there already

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:44.940
 completely out of these lactol - val situations it would not be good either that the mayor

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:48.169
 this is what the mayor loved

00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:51.619
 paulinho already make my city here inside the vase there in the ribeira valley

00:34:51.619 --> 00:34:57.020
 in são paulo there are no more than maybe two thousand people in the center of the city, right

00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:03.440
 for great urban and everything was closed until the sports lottery here is the nephew

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:08.420
 mine is not closed but you have to pay attention to it, there cannot be more than 3 there

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:11.990
 inside even when I said that my niece said little pot contains three here

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:16.100
 I loose day three in my heart, I used to fire fires, it was already good, you can’t

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:22.550
 have three here so now shoe clothing trade house in case

00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:27.260
 humble starts from there the whole closed relationship two closed and personal

00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:31.700
 survived a lot practiced in eldorado i will say i don't know but in many

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:35.900
 municipalities I am selling yourself through the back door this issue of the person

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:40.520
 that not understanding was not a good decision on the part of the ministers of the

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:45.140
 supreme federal court that could be revised i the participation of the model until

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:51.980
 a collection of the ready good to have been that by decree prohibited

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:56.440
 can hold can now what alternative to

00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:02.470
 the product the tv costs nothing to remember until

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:06.520
 Mayor, who is now the largest woman in a public square in Rio de Janeiro for

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:10.109
 example the staff women being valued

00:36:10.109 --> 00:36:13.650
 is the way that vitamin d helps to fight the virus how are you going to

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:17.910
 get vitamin d if i don't take a sun then the part that you up to 90 is

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:22.619
 stimulated right there and it was not free in that radical way the year that happened in

00:36:22.619 --> 00:36:26.460
 I get to know you because maybe that he does information life

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:31.619

00:36:31.619 --> 00:36:34.170

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:41.059
 act when this panic rifle started allows us people from state x

00:36:41.059 --> 00:36:46.410
 who called state government personnel in the neighboring state closed not

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:51.070
 it will close here too so there is a governor who saw

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:58.480
 and close everything has been with santa catarina a person who made a

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:06.730
 absurd absurd is right and so it was almost all over Brazil and we always warn

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:13.180
 we have two waves, right? It’s the personal life of life, you have to be careful, yes, and all

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:17.950
 world knew it ok well manuela disclosed that 80 population once

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:22.270
 contracting the virus wouldn't even know that against me

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:28.270
 it's just age, your physical condition with mine has been criticized a lot in the past, right

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:34.309
 that even opened it was the exchange you that and walking on the plant from time to time

00:37:34.309 --> 00:37:39.680

 soon more side will take there is no way and you will hardly be free of it

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:11.630
 now get ready get ready there is no panic life goes on we can't and

00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:17.630
 destroy a lot by a virus that is there and nobody said in the past that the

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:24.140
 these relapse measures is and avoiding getting it wouldn’t make you get more

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:27.510
 late so that there was not once their contaminated

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:34.890
 and congestion the details and the federal government did its part right

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:40.530
 the part spent I indicate all this I will everything, right, but there are no real ones

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:46.530
 and now look and give the story will say that it acted correctly or not and who

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:51.420
 stimulated panic or not in Brazil and you will have responsibility you super

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:55.470

00:38:55.470 --> 00:39:04.730
 others we continue augusto nunes the risk group sewing on the street and

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:09.390
 relations between brazil and the united states

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:18.370
 the current symbol if it is not to say about it then I

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:27.650
 I arrived at the congress the camera in 1991 I have ahead of him then he glues itamar

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:36.179
 who is the pen took back there the squid dilma the

00:39:36.179 --> 00:39:42.700
 Brazil since he practically doesn’t fhc the store

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:46.660
 hi hi rômulo

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:56.950
 and imperialist oppressors saw the treatment the integration here with fhc the

00:39:56.950 --> 00:40:01.030
 squid and dilma was basically here in south america and that he dictatorships the

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:11.740
 all over the world, right, Cuba, African dictatorships, here’s a love, right, with Venezuela, the countries

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:22.900
 Bolivarian people there she was a person without much importance to the importance

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:29.500
 huge geopolitical its immeasurable riches as well as the arrival I already

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:33.660
 I spoke during the campaign here in the next country of the best of us and

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:39.390
 the right is and even I will talk here to give a problem

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:41.880
 right, give you an example here to give a problem I will not speak the example here

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:47.190
 because you are preventing us from making comparisons as we are dealing with examples that

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:51.549
 everything is prejudice, right, so here I am, so let's talk

00:40:51.549 --> 00:40:55.900
 we have to get close to people, right, we're not leaving anybody here in south america

00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:00.069
 practically right in africa it was possible to do business everybody without problems

00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:07.539
 we will approach these countries in the pre-campaign I had connections where in the

00:41:07.539 --> 00:41:14.289

 her room okay to see how it worked nothing wet

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:35.960
 hit and take off that shirt also in one while I had the

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:40.310

 and no but nothing was economy ok i am the contact here in football want to play ball

00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:59.780
 it is the team that plays who plays ball there in the place of economy Paulo Guedes the gang

00:42:03.069 --> 00:42:09.789
 yes it is during the campaign recognizing my place giving the message states

00:42:09.789 --> 00:42:14.709
 united did not give a state military event there is one at the event there a lecture that

00:42:14.709 --> 00:42:20.289
 I gave it there on the spot there was changed the Brazilian national anthem Mayor continence

00:42:20.289 --> 00:42:25.220
 to the continental united states flag of respect was criticized here in brazil

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:30.830
 sex and any country that is once the flag of falling in love hoisted

00:42:30.830 --> 00:42:36.140
 lilo the event at the event led to selling my tributes to the flag in that country

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:41.270
 easily trump ended up taking notice that I existed is after

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:45.500
 elections we go united states so in this three times the job is on

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:49.790
 three times with shampoo we started a lot of things some were opened others not

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:54.590
 so closed until today is we got something Brazil today is a great

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:59.030
 ally this the one thing that done with the defense of denílson fernando

00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:04.650
 adventus we are getting closer to the data more and more

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:10.829
 and now I also hope, right? I hope it's my fans here I will not interfere

00:43:10.829 --> 00:43:16.160
 in no way can I even gave you like so be it beauty I was the American police

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.740
 follow in argentina also look how it is more as I cheered for

00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:25.680
 macri look at how we are, then it's the people, the change has changed, everything is

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:32.609
 can change right for better or for worse and opted for the demagogy for the lie

00:43:32.609 --> 00:43:38.010
 always there then I owe your father your brother there who is in trouble there now

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:41.549
 you can talk to more property unfortunately already have entrepreneurs

00:43:41.549 --> 00:43:47.279
 argentinos going to uruguay coming to brazil here there started that

00:43:47.279 --> 00:43:53.520
 politics back they spoke to me just now I don't know if it's true is that

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:58.650
 and for you to use a credit card outside Argentina, you pay thirty

00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:04.950
 percent so how do you absurdly personal tax so nationalizing

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:08.820
 companies this is another thing that is true not so long ago was

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:15.120
 confiscating vehicle on the street using the paneme up for this now story by

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:20.190
 trump I'm sure that and let's power it goes a lot ours

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:24.530
 relationship now took place on the other side of me I will look again

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:30.990
 do something similar if they don't want weakness right Brazil will have

00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:36.140
 to get by is around here but I think this thing, the commercial has a lot of things

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:41.580
 in brazil united states regardless of which republican party

00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:46.980
 advocacy together power I support your republic 'given the freedom I have

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:52.320
 that the trump gave me to call him anytime I might need

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:57.940
 here ready for us so hopefully he is trump

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:01.619
 right but if you don't give it he will look for

00:45:01.619 --> 00:45:08.309
 the relationship of our commercial and, after all, the whole world is increasingly

00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:11.999
 with an eye on brazil and already know augusto nunes who is not just the region

00:45:11.999 --> 00:45:18.630
 Amazon is not keeping an eye on everything here is the bill in the Senate and being connected

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:25.440
 it is allowed here the municipalities seeing their lands to other countries right until the

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:29.490
 equivalent to forty percent of your area i like to hit with debated

00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:35.310
 ask you some everything you think about it is the municipality x there

00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:40.350
 what can i sell up to forty percent of your land to other countries i

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:43.890
 I have to have forty percent of the percentage for a country or not the percentage for a country

00:45:43.890 --> 00:45:48.630
 and another percentage for another parent so two countries can buy up to forty

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:55.290
 percent of the area with us how does brazil look if the given country xyz

00:45:55.290 --> 00:46:01.350
 start buying land here in brazil we will be the farm of that country is a

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:07.590
 concern that you have to have and that weighs is a decision and if not taken but

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:17.590
 you have to think about our homeland and thanks for everything ok

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:23.369
 zé maria rosa maria a and there

00:46:23.369 --> 00:46:28.570
 and then the view is that this dispute for the market

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:32.520
 and there and there

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:40.810
 [Music] Brazil is not cleared for

00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:44.799
 Hi Hi

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:53.130
 [Music] is out playing this story in favor

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:58.860
 that Brazil is not there

00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:07.760
 and there and there

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:10.450
 what's up

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:16.730
 and Ze Maria at the beginning of the live, I touched on this subject, right?

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:21.200
 people are just cheering all right this is the car is quiet there taking ubatuba there

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:28.280
 in there was eating german on whatsapp is fried goes and cheering has problem o

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:34.740
 problem is that there are hi people the influential month together a whole

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:41.460
 part of the media preaching disinformation is preached here the outside company takes

00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:47.670
 knowledge about that outside that same press takes the published matter

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:53.010
 out there that you were a discovery even the crazy republic in here and

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:59.069
 then, attacking the government, even talking about the victim, all the time, that's enough.

00:47:59.069 --> 00:48:03.960
 see that a little while ago, we had environmental paint ministers, there isn’t

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:08.490
 problem for his name that was tito so is marina silva is the zequinha

00:48:08.490 --> 00:48:16.950
 sarney julião on o like carlos minc do boi pirata and then o

00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:20.809
 that happens at that time there was also a fire in brazil

00:48:20.809 --> 00:48:27.119
 deforestation day now what these people do not collaborate is right said like this

00:48:27.119 --> 00:48:30.420
 we can practically solve a large part of this if the measure

00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:36.750
 provisional land tenure regulation had been voted on and that if I were

00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:44.789
 voted would have been approved and you would have to know right satellite globe the focus

00:48:44.789 --> 00:48:50.309
 fire in the survey in question cpmg identifies that the owner of that

00:48:50.309 --> 00:48:55.619
 then afterwards I go to the area to find out if what has been deforested so far

00:48:55.619 --> 00:48:58.400
 if it was already allowed, it was deforestation

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:05.059
 and even ours the only country in the world that changes that is also the one with the

00:49:05.059 --> 00:49:10.460
 legal reserve is in the amazon region is the singer doing the for example of me is

00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:16.880
 what's your mikitas eighty percent 803 can't move it he can move 200

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:21.680
 hectares and then you kill everyone there’s no problem except that she looks

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:27.740
 so it’s so close, right, if you’re ready for a year, you don’t work almost missing

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:31.760
 a lap in active again that you kill yourself in front new say the man

00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:36.230
 deforestation that you catch deforestation in the latest amazon videos

00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:42.349
 you've already deforested all of Brazil because the super area is betting on the

00:49:42.349 --> 00:49:46.609
 another now this information fight we get partly in the media

00:49:46.609 --> 00:49:53.480
 social media the media only a small beach speaks the truth it seems that I

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:58.410
 I was watching a live today, that was doctor glue as well

00:49:58.410 --> 00:50:05.369
 the clubs i'm going to alexandre garcia is when the guy speaks the truth he said

00:50:05.369 --> 00:50:11.099
 what reason when you speak the truth here doesn’t happen so it’s practically the same not

00:50:11.099 --> 00:50:15.030
 can tell the truth things have to get in that wave without

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:19.710
 good and when you speak for example deforestation in the amazon region i don't

00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:26.400
 I don't know what is right here, but almost sixty percent of that in Brazil is right there in the

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:30.060
 legal amazon put how are you going to take care of a work like this now

00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:35.970
 another lie in the forest you are a mine does not catch fire it catches fire in

00:50:35.970 --> 00:50:41.820
 periphery now stay inside the legal amazon ok i stop who is responsible

00:50:41.820 --> 00:50:46.320
 forty percent of the fires and many fires is nothing in the same area

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:53.010
 every year and it takes too but the north of mato grosso part of rondônia is ok if not

00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:57.810
 there is a legal amazon in these three states, there are the number of fires and there in

00:50:57.810 --> 00:51:02.690
 low I'm doing the possible yes the zipper

00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:06.140
 of the republic the general mourão for sure is the

00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:11.079
 and he is the chief is the commander there for the conservation of the amazon

00:51:11.079 --> 00:51:17.769
 and raw we have genius the guarantee of the free environmental dodge had no recourse

00:51:17.769 --> 00:51:21.459
 today we filed a request for reinforcement at the national congress to vote

00:52:26.410 --> 00:52:31.330
 words the states spoke looked at his samuel pa what he wants you

00:52:31.330 --> 00:52:36.340
 regulating a lot is not allowed to those who committed the crime it is not desirable to

 I'm going to work delivering the hi production and insurance doesn't always cover everything

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:16.890
 what he planted and it’s these country men who are

00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:20.670
 guaranteeing more savings until the situation that is currently guaranteed by

00:53:20.670 --> 00:53:24.710
 four consecutive months from the distance post to the export rule of

00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:32.730
 products that come from the countryside in the mountains so people's lives are not easy

00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:38.040
 farmer is not easy in Brazil I remember back when I was a boy

00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:41.940
 when you arrived at the sports lottery in the federal that my father said you wanted

00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:45.900
 having to buy land today I want to think twice bought a war and

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:51.960
 a lot has changed during the pre-campaign I said I wanted to merge

00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:55.950
 the ministries of environment and agriculture have a very good feeling

00:53:55.950 --> 00:54:02.810
 in the first moment together with the country man over time we took

00:54:02.810 --> 00:54:08.250
 knowledge that the ministry would be too heavy for him alone as a

00:54:08.250 --> 00:54:12.380
 good and we decided to keep lilo both

00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:16.990
 ministries and picks you up the ministry looks forward to seeing culture who is there

00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:23.420

 her nickname she may not like it I put an atomic ant on it that there that I

00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:38.210
 mind is always a channel all over the world it opens the market for brazil we are

00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:43.400
 importing the world more and more we all feed agribusiness one more

00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:48.290
 million is another billion people have thing

00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:54.560
 better than that and well when we have the goal of relief in that they started to

00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:58.520
 direct to import thing two so as not to depend only on one country as it is

00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:04.130
 what can the country say that agriculture is incipient, right?

00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:09.890
 there and the soil will also depend on just one country i am opening the market

00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:16.630
 for famous to find india the good market then until a second on wanke 49

00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:22.060
 countries opened trade with us, it’s only in front of the Christianity that was

00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:27.340
 indicated by the ruralist bench arruda we speak but you cannot put

00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:31.930
 deputy with the roll with the vinícius then I went back to training that we go and another

00:55:31.930 --> 00:55:34.390
 why voting for me was a deputy too

00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:40.720
 well then see if you answer that answered answer here daughter carlos

 as soon as you want him to leave another story, right for me, I'm doing

00:55:43.809 --> 00:55:50.710
 exceptional work and in some I think that being less environmentally friendly

00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:55.059
 suffocate by passing a fine imposed on whoever is in the law the fine

00:55:55.059 --> 00:56:00.000
 last case arrives in the rural producer has a problem you talk warns

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:06.519
 shows it guides you when you come back after some time there if

00:56:06.519 --> 00:56:11.859
 persist in the mistake of doing back to speak of noticed the machine

00:56:11.859 --> 00:56:17.680
 it is difficult to accomplish disassembled anything it's just that you're doing the right thing or not

00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:23.859
 can the owner whatever the urban or rural producer the habit goes there

00:56:23.859 --> 00:56:28.539
 know you have please and that code selection what we did

00:56:28.539 --> 00:56:32.999
 here in Brazil is to follow the law

00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:38.410

 was the target of some criticism including from a supreme court minister

00:56:49.089 --> 00:56:54.280
 federal gilmar mendes he said the armed forces were associating with

00:56:54.280 --> 00:57:00.039
 a genocide wanted to know your assessment of politics so far and

00:57:00.039 --> 00:57:05.799
 mainly about the future your studies in the face of these criticisms show studies

00:57:05.799 --> 00:57:11.049
 some change in the way of fighting the coronavirus the criticisms we changed the

00:57:11.049 --> 00:57:13.890
 plans specifically by the ministry of

00:57:13.890 --> 00:57:24.960
 the sound of today the constructive criticism without income

00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:31.260

 there was a contact between children one even if the link makes the mistake in this conversation

00:57:58.990 --> 00:58:07.150

 if he were the owner of the truth marcelo heap of contradictions here does he

00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:34.990

00:59:30.290 --> 00:59:33.220
 mayor who gets in touch with the deadline and you will see who it is

00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:38.830

01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:14.200
 manager me 2016 the big management the father of the rio olympics takes his car

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:19.450
 it was complicated there, who knows, right, here is the politician to manage your business, right and

01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:24.070
 even problems and assumed it worked out was a successful January cleanup after

01:00:24.070 --> 01:00:29.350
 also have, but it is not possible at the time of the operation hosted in roraima, it is so

01:00:29.350 --> 01:00:34.080
 success problem had had suffering invader right venerating him fleeing from hunger

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:39.970
 of misery and violence also practiced by a grandfather nagle duda he

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:45.599
 took charge of this operation and managed to do what was possible and

01:00:45.599 --> 01:00:49.979
 praised by the UN for his work he also as an interventor in addition to roraima

01:00:49.979 --> 01:00:55.799
 he was secretary of economics doing economics okay and did another job

01:00:55.799 --> 01:01:02.069
 there in the government of roraima is calling even before the skinny take over and a

01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:05.999
 condemned party is also more exceptional so a right person in the

01:01:05.999 --> 01:01:10.229
 right place you can see who asked that there was brom who

01:01:10.229 --> 01:01:15.389
 the good sobral wave worked, I don’t want to point it out if it’s obviously right

01:01:15.389 --> 01:01:21.089
 is deviations and misdeeds would be given in any ministry then we call the

01:01:21.089 --> 01:01:25.619
 beginning of conversation that sometimes up to a month doesn’t know that resolves this issue

01:01:25.619 --> 01:01:33.779
 now this demilitarization story is not even there, you already give

01:01:33.779 --> 01:01:37.319
 a public opinion poll on them military are very well evaluated here

01:01:37.319 --> 01:01:41.669
 as a minister although we have excellent service here this service I

 in some they want it to be more aggressive or the lawyer's job is to show this

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:22.599
 solution is not to show up flapping screaming is not this for him it makes a

01:02:22.599 --> 01:02:26.950
 very good job also helps me go from the beginning maybe you have the

01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:36.700
