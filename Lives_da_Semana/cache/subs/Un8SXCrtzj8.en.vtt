00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.709
is is is

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:14.010
 And then I'm working okay, it's not good night

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:21.369
 Thursday November 12th 19 hours here is Elisângela I have met from all over

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.920
 our pound interpreter is that minister Damares woman human right

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.559
 I don't know if I got the order right here she will say something like that

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:38.370
 interesting she was criticized is unfairly for something so then

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.710
 going back to Jesus, he will explain this here and the second time back there is

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.500
 that we are going to talk about politics, right, the first part here doesn’t have a policy

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.309
 here only news and for us to really update this first thing

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.559
 today had woke up early from a headline did not make the headline in the Estado Newspaper

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:06.060
 from São Paulo saying that the government just doesn't speak government I am I would send a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:14.910
 PEC for the congress where Goiás products are not a case of committing a crime

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.009
 environmental your property would be expropriated you would be losing your

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.770
 property is well I took notice that if

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.830
 because I never discussed it with anyone and I wouldn’t discuss it already

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.790
 know my position doing when I went to see it was a proposal from the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.690
 Amazon Council and here is one of the items here

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.980
 good then priority strategic actions the council of the amazon for

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:53.790
 combat mental climate there and breed rural and urban properties and that the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.890
 urban poverty The presence of a home affected by environmental crimes or resulting from

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.540
 Village or public land exploration without authorization immediately I

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.540
 I said that this I didn't know yet, but in the morning I said that this is a

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.270
 fake News is a lie from the São Paulo game or a brave someone from the government

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:23.100
 and with the entire Damares Ciel portfolio, a person who is dismissible in my view

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.670
 eligible for a red card right at the beginning is the same thing with all due respect

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.600
 if someone from the government here starts to say that I will send a PEC to the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.710
 congress to legalize abortion is a better card ok let's go back

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:42.700
 here for disarmament it is a red card also there is no conversation when

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.129
 and when this married man among yours already knows one of my virtues my

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.080
 defect so we have a line has an agenda that the glue does not give up

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.480
 of a collection like this because private property I cannot admit

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.410
 nothing for itself there I understand that it is Sacred is one of the tripods of

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.630
 Democracy I understand it that way, right? It’s exactly one of the tripods is the

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.760
 private property You cannot live it and suddenly by any action

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.390
 you lose your private property makes it clear that there is a

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.710
 81 parole email exists seeing that I am 8110 2014

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:32.690
 is that it speaks of land expropriation right For those who plant for those who cultivate

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:39.020
 psychotropic plants without authorization or practice the exploitation of slave labor

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.610
 is the problem of this PEC is not for the first round it was almost unanimously

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:50.900
 approval in the second round of PSOL, they touched a little bit of reality,

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.890
 PEC here and we already had I don't know how much deeper the people who voted

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.840
 against her and you can talk gosh I'm in favor of slave work calm because

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.860
 no one please slave labor but only the 20 today existed at that time

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.260
 that I work analogous to slavery can also be and can be typified

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.120
 as a slave, so what happens if you want to work with Cravinas there with all

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.519
 respect right I know little about it helps me Major for example if you

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:28.680
 if you have a poorly ventilated accommodation dirty bedding a lot away

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.970
 not a lot in the non-regulatory regime I’m scoring in another and I only work on analysis

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.530
 Bondage the point doing it will lose I'm doing because of that you have

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.740
 spraying a plantation without all the equipment it will lose its

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.659
 property because of this is not an excess and it is not just him the zone to pick up

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:53.880
 reality items are 90 years old there your children and grandchildren and maybe the great-grandchildren right

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.039
 who worked under the law with their parents over 60 years old will lose all that there

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:04.979
 and now what would be the newest proposal has already been abolished here right at

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.770
 beginning there is no conversation about this one

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:15.090
 well then we already gave the answer because I got up early with a lot of people

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.940
 from the countryside so looking here my social peace with this proposal of the

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.699
 government that wasn’t supposed to post my none knew that there is not even

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:27.419
 patient discussing with all respect to the council of the Amazon, right?

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.289
 work but not even to discuss this conversation so I will address here with

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:36.470
 she But I agree President threatens private property she causes

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:43.259
 social instability and this is a government that guarantees social stability that

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:48.030
 guarantees and strengthening the family and we can no longer live on this

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:54.090
 type of threat in Brazil is the first is private right represents the

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:00.400
 materialization work and talk here about urban property in your house

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.620
 for example, it may be that your child has raised an animal there that you don’t even

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.240
 you know that you’re being created from that evil there’s framed there in that group

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.520
 distinction power suddenly someone is working you are surprised your son

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.800
 uncle take that snake in there this animal and you will be fined and help

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.670
 you lose yours from your house i'm passing because of us we already have law

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:30.640
 enough to guarantee punishment for a case like this

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:36.250
 loss of private property I think it is the absurdity of the Absurd President I

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.260
 I think that a topic like this is out of any debate in this current Brazil

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.250
 good but private is sacred I haven't lived before If one day the

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.950
 communism socialism here as you have tried several times from there

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.820
 and let's see how the people behave so I can be

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.680
 talking [ __ ] of a knife the [ __ ] for me armed people are people who

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.670
 it will not be enslaving so it is my arms policy in Brazil that the

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:05.000
 banditry i already have water the good citizen is missing now so i can

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.500
 fix more I need the Brazilian Congress you vote in favor of João

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:15.590
 Victor or investigate it there I do not want to rush what can be I called

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:21.350
 for the Federal Police as chief, right, I am not lacking in justice as well as who in the

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.760
 by law the director joined Federal so I'm not interfering with anything I called

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.200
 to know the progress of this issue go there obviously a collection is there in

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.880
 Brasília formation That the Federal Police is in a position to carry out is

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:42.370
 really a report, right, do an investigation to know the causes of the explosion of that

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:48.290
 of that transformer can be several which at first is not lightning can be a

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:52.259
 good overhead and stuff more than anything can

00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:56.550
 put it on our minds is a princess will investigate it here because a

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:01.820
 coincidence, right? There's an upcoming election, someone may even have a political interest.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:06.030
 practiced some act in that sense there in the state of Amapá I hope I don't

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:12.090
 but even Fini will now say what was the cause of the Explosion there from that one

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:18.020
 transformer lives in front Bora look And then

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:24.010
 and speak here quick thing here with two forces just here railroad auction

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:27.400
 west-east I intend to bring here in the next Garcias to touch this

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.570
 subject that is of utmost importance to all of us is transportation

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:35.260
 Railway has been reactivated by our government here so this railway

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:41.050
 west-east is known as fiol ok so we have a section that obviously doesn’t

00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:47.140
 allow you to complete this work, right? It was released by the court of

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:52.540
 Union accounts after 12 years stopped then 12 years stopped and the text So

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:58.210
 rocked to decide to release this stretch here of 500 and a few km long he

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:03.160
 call over there and forget about Caetité and Ilhéus I think in Bahia here you know

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.990
 name that should be in Bahia here ok then here or if it is important with

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:13.150
 mine here at the ore outflow in Regina do Sudoeste de da

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:18.970
 Bahia, right, to the port, right, and it also has to connect the network of the

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:25.000
 north-south railroad was also stopped for a long time and a stretch of 1,500 km and

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.150
 we’re going to pass along with Deputy Major Vitor Hugo has a

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:33.250
 present in Goiás was signed with one with the company towards If I am not mistaken

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:41.710
 tidy right ah the beginning of the execution of this work EA forecast to end on 22 and

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:46.390

 for the confidence, right, of the transmitted, this one is just our whole lips

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:37.770
 thursday if we get it wrong we are sure i was going to make a constructive criticism but

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:42.270
 with intelligence not in evil because we have the extreme confidence in Jovem Pan

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:48.060
 Augusto Nunes your your team they as a journalist the last article to take

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:54.130
 here on the agenda of entering the door of Damares here look

00:12:54.130 --> 00:13:02.020
 on Friday at our Renaissance in Paraná,

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:06.580
 small hydroelectric plant under the responsibility of the farmers of

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:14.280
 region is PC HD Bedin and look what they took if I don't

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:22.050
 mistake 20 years to get the environmental license 20 years once it got its

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:27.960
 leave in nine months they did the pch to prevent it and it was a private group so the

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:35.240
 she did with the BNDS resource, then, of R $ 30 million and she

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:41.100
 serves a city of approximately 50,000 people so a small Central

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.580
 hydroelectric as our own name says not central and east is small is not

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:50.700
 very Itaipu is a small Central Although the good news also I want

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:54.720
 today here the governor of Pará Paraná Ratinho Júnior that he said he has already

00:13:54.720 --> 00:14:01.440
 got a license for another 40 pch in the state of Paraná So if we go

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:06.630
 stay 40 let's suppose it wasn't the same is the same power there as the 40

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:12.930
 times 50 50 thousand here from two million That's right already two million dealt with the

00:14:12.930 --> 00:14:17.910
 Serves serves two million people I don't know the population of Curitiba doesn't have

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:23.400
 idea here but surely two million is not Cascavel must be less than

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:31.020
 that this Foz do Iguaçu must be the same, it helps then, bro

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.860
 I don’t know Curitiba see things inhabitants have Curitiba here ok but I think

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.530
 any other city in Curitiba I don't have a big one here too I doubt it

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:42.180
 I don't think so, I would definitely go more and a city the

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:47.020
 several small ones right look just this mine is this

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:54.190
 and until 40 pch I would like to meet linen in Curitiba as a whole and detail I had

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:59.920
 there with Jorge Jorge Safe I even put a nickname René Jorge tilápia Safe he’s

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.940
 always doing national work throughout Brazil with regard to fish farming

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:09.310
 and we released some I took some fingerlings the excellent one we released is

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:13.360
 from catfish Jundiá I lived in Jundiaí Jundiaí I think I die of

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.770
 interest the name of the dance you’re seeing letting go So I don’t know the size of the

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:23.470
 Mirror of Water there but it must be in the voice of more than four here Thales and second

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:29.350
 there Embrapa data to an accumulated the day that Thales has percent can produce

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:35.050
 up to 10 to 15 tons and took off a year if you share the same space

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:41.800
 of a hectare I don’t know multiply by 10 or go down then 100 to 150 tons of

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:47.000
 tilapia per year and we are working on pure lagriidae So Ju

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.510
 that you had in Paraguay It started with the right minister there in Paraguay to

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:57.820
 do a great production this Lapa on Lake Itaipu now would not be the creation

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:04.010
 free release would be shared and there a young man without speaking a part of the lake beyond

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:09.260
 of tilapia feed South America todinha So look at the potential a country

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:15.410
 that has water like ours does not, is prone to make gas PC has as in

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:20.920
 own ch you raise fish too now you come back to us is not

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.339
 o It is well in advance that Minister Bento Albuquerque things are not

00:16:24.339 --> 00:16:31.810
 easy here we are to leave the environmental legislation for gas PC rounded off we

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:36.519
 we want to make life easier for anyone who wants to do a pch in their

00:16:36.519 --> 00:16:42.220
 energy property for him to neighborhood he can do a lot

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:46.420
 that electricity maybe even a small industry something she

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:51.760
 sell energy from the neighboring city So this is very good for us and us

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:56.410
 help here everything that doesn’t know tomorrow we’ve already had problems with the shovel

00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:01.600
 with blackouts in the past we cannot take that risk here in Brazil because

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:06.400
 We can face more great travel and much of the energy our lives

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:11.949
 see there from the hydraulics, right from the rivers and We must take advantage of the legs and gas that

00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:18.400
 you energy and also for fish production one more thing here as well

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:23.209
 ending here when we left my three Renaissance there We stopped in the city

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:27.949
 Coronel Freitas Santa Catarina is there and there is nothing

00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:32.659
 Lady on the football field The people are doing very well I couldn't stay more than 30

00:17:32.659 --> 00:17:38.840
 minutes because the moon was getting dark and the helicopter that

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:44.119
 take off take off with the luso so it was very bad passing very fast there in

00:17:44.119 --> 00:17:48.019
 when I go ahead but I thank you for the way we were treated by the population and

00:17:48.019 --> 00:17:51.590
 all our trip will always have a joke

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:56.059
 is the brand how to make more clarification in relation to issues

00:17:56.059 --> 00:18:02.330
 that we went abroad outside Brazil is denounced that we have a

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:07.370
 genocide during the invitation here and that we will kill millions who came first

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:19.130
 we do not have 980 thousand Indians in Brazil and we have one imagine a region

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:32.360
 Southeast Minas Gerais Greater São Paulo which is Greater Rio de Janeiro has more than

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:38.750
 I need to say the following the Indians in Brazil President were never

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:44.990
 as careful as they are now wanting to know how many indigenous people died from living together

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:51.230
 world said it was a million we got to 480 number so EA rate

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.669
 mortality and among the Indians in Brazil during the

00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:58.230
 period of coexistence and was 1.8 while in the urban area it was five

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:04.500
 so President unfortunately we lost 480 Indians but I mean

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:09.799
 for all of Brazil we take care of our lives is very precious

00:19:09.799 --> 00:19:16.140
 we lost 480 but it's not what they said out there that we're going to have thousands of

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:20.970
 Indians dying in Brazil due to living together and we are continuing we

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:24.570
 we will continue to take care of them especially making the guarantee

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:31.350
 this today we have cured five million people the invitation now

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:35.460
 cured like you don’t have an official remedy You don’t have a remedy with

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:39.240
 purchase with scientific proof and we know you don’t have it but the staff has

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:44.580
 used the hydration here I used some here a crazy There is like everyone here

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:50.010
 everybody is everybody here is in the state here in

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:56.130
 flock to send the herd here will have used and see my little one and have to use

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:59.010
 Anitta also has your weird name, right? Marcos has it here

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:05.160
 that conclusion came and we already have the proof it serves as the medicine and

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:09.180
 now the serum also appeared but after I said there why not invest

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:14.670
 more than you, who also invests in the cure and not only in the vaccine, the vaccine seems to

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:17.309
 there is something weird coming up out there I’m not going to talk here to avoid

00:20:17.309 --> 00:20:22.530
 controversy that I'm politicizing the vaccine collection and cowardly saying that the

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:26.670
 that I lived to death a person who has a video of mine an audio of mine an

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:33.179
 my publication in that sense I pasted will give a third story in a

00:20:33.179 --> 00:20:37.440
 there’s an element from Facebook that wasn’t celebrating anything

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.370
 also and much of the press went to the side that I commemorated the death of

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:45.059
 a person who is not defined yet looks like it was suicide right now they are

00:20:45.059 --> 00:20:48.340
 trying to investigate why and it starts the spirit is usually a

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:56.770
 history of depression the woman left him the husband left it was a series of

00:20:56.770 --> 00:21:02.980
 thing there family history often losing a job lost everything to

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:08.679
 cause one because of the suicide, right? And then, obviously, being a suicide, there is no

00:21:08.679 --> 00:21:14.470
 nothing to do with the vaccine and proceeds may be the side effect of that of the vaccine not

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:20.380
 it can be everything it can be so I don't know if it will reach the conclusion and it clarifies and

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:24.730
 returns to research the crown vaccine in the case of the cow column than that of China and with

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:29.770
 still there doing your forehead Rios is something right who will decide on the

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:35.950
 vaccine in Brazil Ministry of Health obviously and then the certification of

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:41.950
 Anvisa on my part with the vaccine proven by Anvisa and by

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:46.610
 friendship of health we are going to make a purchase but it is not buying at the price

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:51.470
 is a caboclo there who is already very worried about his mouth

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:55.580
 Ok, the vaccine was purchased, right, so we want the spreadsheet

00:21:55.580 --> 00:22:01.220
 cost is a thirst and on my part right I know it’s not up to me that there I

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:06.740
 I want to know if this country used the vaccine there in your country is like armament when

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:10.309
 you manufacture the increase any part of the world the father wants to buy talks like that

00:22:10.309 --> 00:22:14.150
 that your army using this armament then you’re using it’s just that it’s good

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:19.460
 let's go here too so let's buy it there so it's simple and in the

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:27.140
 fifth depend on me too the vaccine will not be mandatory as far as depending on

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:34.160
 I still say Thank you that you think there is no question called in Brazil

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.880
 human rights and that we will see this vaccine in the light of human rights

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:42.290
 that's human rights violation President here now talking about

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:46.620
 continuing talking, invite an Indian being cared for here, president

 receiving in that period to care for the elderly President it never happened

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:33.179
 in Brazil the federal government sends money directly to the shelter for

00:23:33.179 --> 00:23:38.850
 example President this institution here looks over there in the city there in Mato Grosso

00:23:38.850 --> 00:23:46.080

 earning now from the Federal Government to take care there in the Shelter of our elderly in

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:04.990

 minutes more than 37 thousand said from what i saw no i just went 2017/2018 that i

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:08.150

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:12.799
 stop there put us chat with the people I couldn't get to know the city

00:25:12.799 --> 00:25:23.750
 there was time, right, the size so it looks serious is a wheel that justifies us

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:29.540
 this is Human Rights President an honor to deliver to you and for

00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:36.490
 talking about human rights remember this here President hug Marajó was the

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:46.620
 all the federal government in 109 and federal government actions in art

00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:50.670
 Marajó was an incredible day he wasn’t president it was an incredible day to talk

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:55.980
 people like me every place in Brazil that I have gone to, right, the different people with the

00:25:55.980 --> 00:26:01.050
 people go to the inaugural northeast and water we see that it is a people has a countenance

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:07.230
 more more more rigid is a thicker skin is due to the lack of water and to be

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:12.480
 punished by the drop the sound there is to find right in Marajó The water is left over there

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:17.490
 has the butt of this now is also a face unlike any other

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:21.600
 place in Brazil So Brazil is a do not say the micro but they are are regions

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:25.050
 really different sometimes within the region itself the people also

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:33.000
 extremely healthy friends I went there in the INSS boat and the INSS box the Bank

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.140
 of Pedro, right, in the [ __ ] of the weight of Caixa Econômica lacked, enabling the

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:41.550
 a family to receive emergency assistance we also talk

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:46.600
 quickly with people feel a little bit of their drama

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:52.780
 to transmit to you the way to talk if you are shy or not so much feeling

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:57.940
 that only your photos but you are there and really Marajó was

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:04.620
 discovery by Damares staff is easy Good afternoon Damares minister there human time

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:08.289
 picks up the ministers and boys who preceded the brand make a

00:27:08.289 --> 00:27:13.600
 comparison make a comparison that you always do any Melissa but if

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.260
 pass the thing more I usually say man already gives more gives more I think there is

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:24.970
 apart from that presidential ministry, right? It’s from the Braga branch, Jorge’s grandson who

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:29.320
 hasn't left there yet I think we don't have the resources

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:33.370
 city ​​hall about next year 200 million for 8 secretariats the whole year

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:37.240
 but I go after money in every place for example I won 100 million

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:41.679
 President car wash and know what I'm going to do with semi-new car wash

00:27:41.679 --> 00:27:46.610

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:58.040
 what is it here for boys in conflict with the law president the government

 previous one left us a defect of 62 units of that the prisons are like

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:10.549
 Ministry of Justice but these units that house the boys stay with me and

00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:15.650
 we have to build in Brazil 62 and here is the first one being delivered to

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:20.419
 by the government in Vitória da Conquista and we are going to build now in Tocantins

00:28:20.419 --> 00:28:25.490
 Goiás and Minas Gerais 100 million I got from the car wash and uncle Guedes I

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:30.190
 I want more I need to deliver 62

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:49.380
 attend human rights and a lot of criticism and we needed

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:56.600
 talk a little bit about it, time is running out, right? You were quite

00:28:56.600 --> 00:29:03.020
 beaten you example during the week for having a project for

00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:07.590
 professionalize transvestites this so let there be a little bit here what happens

00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:12.180
 which is just to talk about the more with a pie there different from the president or For us

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:16.740
 everyone is a human being for everyone it has to be like this she gets amendment

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:22.410
 imposing if you speak a message then Victor Hugo for example has his own

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:27.210
 his State of Goiás priorities he usually the left-wing personnel

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:32.190
 presents a positive amendment so that the Ministry of Human Rights

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:38.460
 purchase and she had to comply with an LGBT agenda as envisaged in the amendment we

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:43.020
 we have to comply with the law so the option became yours and you went to the side

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:49.049
 to professionalize Travessa speaks about prostitution and victim of violence

00:29:49.049 --> 00:29:53.890
 we will not do male we will not do seminar those caatingas remember

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:59.980
 what we are going to do is protect this audience that now invites the President

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:05.559
 are starving are sick So we are going to give courses for this

00:30:05.559 --> 00:30:10.450
 transvestite population to become professional in order to enter the market in the

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:14.860
 work and so the call notice that is open with whom institution can apply

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:19.150
 enable to give the course to transvestites so here Guys this is the

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:24.190
 our Ministry's role to protect everyone and they are everyone's country and the president speaks

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:29.039
 that no one will be left behind now the parliamentarian puts it I'm obliged by and

00:30:29.039 --> 00:30:33.820
 President if I don't comply don't Execute the parliamentary amendment has a

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:38.740
 parliamentary here it is imposing I answer for crime of responsibility

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:43.860
 I have to comply with the amendment that the parliamentarian sends to the ministry

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:46.610
 I was upset because the person even more

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:52.130
 Ah ok If it weren't, I wouldn't be in this ministry and working with budgets

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:56.450
 minutes any minister likes to work with a bigger budget he has

00:30:56.450 --> 00:31:04.610
 more things to offer for everyone so really only 200 million for all

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:08.299
 politics is very little now also comes money from parliamentary and as

00:31:08.299 --> 00:31:13.549
 comes to the LGBT community and the policy is hers as I see it in front of

00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:18.590
 best possible policy looks public because it takes professionalizing on the street to

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:22.340
 people nobody wants to see anyone on the street, right? It's the life of the transvestite, it's also on the street

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:25.820
 a long time in a short time he has no life anymore he will be a person

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:31.010
 there who will be affected by the most varied problems possible and is a person

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:36.679
 that he will not be a human being his Fullness cannot Damásio polished and

00:31:36.679 --> 00:31:43.549
 professionalized understand Thanks to President just to inform you that we

00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:46.620

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.750

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:12.909
 biscuit here the cookie right the pretended work of the Federal Police is right

00:33:12.909 --> 00:33:20.619
 the light stuff is not going to be a wooden cookie Look at you there that many

00:33:20.619 --> 00:33:25.809
 is sometimes criticizes the government on the environmental issue pay attention you know what

00:33:25.809 --> 00:33:30.340
 is reception a guy steals or steals something a third party buys in that

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:36.340
 even this is the third person at the reception something this The theme is this

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:41.499
 will be framed in the crime of reception when it comes to wood from the

00:33:41.499 --> 00:33:47.409
 Brazil to Brazil deforest right the good Saudades Marta right the bolsonaro captain

00:33:47.409 --> 00:33:54.249
 chainsaw deforest that the federal police did she took the DNA and the various

00:33:54.249 --> 00:33:58.870
 wood in Brazil that wood that the scientific name

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:05.350
 writing the scientific name here I have 16 cookies but there are 16 more

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:10.570
 Bosque but there is more and the scientific name I will say here no scientific name

00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:15.100
 that even I would have difficulty making pronouncements, but come in here Maçaranduba

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:26.649
 Angelim ferro cedrinho Angelim Cambará cupiúba Cumaru Jatobá sandromar IP between

00:34:26.649 --> 00:34:33.320
 others then what the police are doing and arrives at the port where the legal wood is

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:36.359
 being exported Ah ok

00:34:36.359 --> 00:34:43.950
 well then what happens given the DNA the police don't know where that came from

00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:49.409
 an area that is an indigenous reserve is sold, which cannot be done

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:56.159
 management right felling trees to export legally PF finds out

00:34:56.159 --> 00:35:01.730
 look at this wood, it’s not even hot, but it came in mesh and it’s not going to be

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:05.730
 transported to will not be unbearable now detail does not want more

00:35:05.730 --> 00:35:14.579
 important now on top of the DNA that was the work done over time we

00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:20.849
 we know each wood has to be there was this one for example here Send a

00:35:20.849 --> 00:35:29.400
 udder chevrole is going to France Belgium and England Portugal Denmark

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:35.130
 Italy and so each cookie here is discovered where it’s going to be made So this is

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:37.930
 many countries did not ask and you know which countries most

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:41.560
 competitive right and it's all documented now here so it seems that it doesn't

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:46.060
 felt that the sun in fact the receivers of you can speak ah but the

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:50.230
 invoice is cool I think she knows it's not cool I think she knows

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:53.980
 have a terrible care any little thing wow in here now when

00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:58.840
 interest to them do Vista grossa never wants to know if you are listening to place

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:04.840
 that is allowed or not and they always criticize us so let's put a point

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:12.070
 export of wood with DNA defined by the Federal Police for

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:17.080
 countries whatever they were if you have a contract something upside down

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:20.920
 exists but it doesn’t have that much wood to be exported so it won’t be

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:26.230
 exported and this country will now have to become aware ok

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:31.300
 collaborating with us so that wood removed from the area that is not allowed to

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:36.380
 deforestation some help in this had been helping not to deforest

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:41.390
 the region of Brazil is explained no but I will explain next week yes

00:36:41.390 --> 00:36:46.579

00:36:46.579 --> 00:36:51.670
 here and explain in more detail and this collection for you here

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:58.569
 let's stop saying that bolsonaro has a killer he is the enemy of the environment

00:36:58.569 --> 00:37:03.859
 I'm here together Gilson Fernando Noronha how many inspectors do you have me

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:22.029
 the size of Brazil I don’t know how much in total 50 on the island I think the

00:37:22.029 --> 00:37:30.700
 enough for the size of the Island now we have to put help we are no longer

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.700
 It is

00:37:36.359 --> 00:37:40.049
 and it’s transparent here it’s quiet game let Gilson say it’s good to

00:37:53.309 --> 00:37:57.269
 discussion of the answer but any answer is a very sensitive topic gave

00:37:57.269 --> 00:38:01.680
 by Jovem Pan I know that there will be no problem now other broadcasters we are

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:08.249

00:38:08.249 --> 00:38:12.059
 have a problem so come on come on I can help you here arresting ask yourself

00:38:12.059 --> 00:38:15.589
 who wants Augusto Nunes

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:22.130
 Hi good night president 'good night minister Damares minister uses lawyers

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:27.530
 of perpetrators of passionate crimes continue to invoke as an argument of

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:35.690
 defense of such a legitimate defense of honor what do you think of it Look at this

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:41.930
 this happens with a lawyer Certainly the judiciary does not accept more is no longer

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:47.300
 the country of the colonels here this is a country that applies justice and justice to

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:53.060
 everyone is absurd we still see the defense wanting to say that the man killed in

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:58.580
 legitimate honor of the Defense it doesn’t exist anymore this argument doesn’t stick to the

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:04.460
 Brazilian judiciary I had a lot around, right, couples, one that is although the other is not

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:08.119
 want to leave usually happens to the when usually the most woman wants to go

00:39:08.119 --> 00:39:11.600
 and the man doesn’t want to leave she wants to leave for some reason and neither

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:15.530
 want to know the reason we are down very quickly for the wedding I'm in

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:18.380
 its what happened i'm at the second wedding

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:24.330
 establish a stable union these two marriages there and many times a man

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:28.549
 by the use of force, you know, and it makes a freak out there, commits a crime

00:39:28.549 --> 00:39:34.579
 and then there is talk that the man did that because the woman did what he did not

00:39:34.579 --> 00:39:38.900
 should do and he did that will update of self-defense not if

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:50.980
 justifies resolving Our inadmissible the other question he ministers Damares

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:56.269
 some schools are adopting what they are calling gender neutrality

00:39:56.269 --> 00:40:02.240
 if some language adaptations changes recently a college circular

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:08.539
 French-Brazilian government recommending, for example, the use of quires students as the

00:40:08.539 --> 00:40:13.579
 lady has seen this trend minister thank you so wanting to do

00:40:13.579 --> 00:40:18.349
 an orthographic reform without talking to Brazil this is a joke is

00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:22.819
 clowning that knows how we are going to fight prejudice

00:40:22.819 --> 00:40:26.130
 discrimination is with human rights education of

00:40:26.130 --> 00:40:31.500
 we are doing this story of changing words in Brazil she is the how

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:35.549
 a great clowning good to think straight about it let's think and not

00:40:35.549 --> 00:40:40.680
 this is how the nation imposes itself to fight prejudice President I am

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:44.789
 thus getting more and more horrified by the quality of the schools that were

00:40:44.789 --> 00:40:51.750
 famous schools embarking on this to destroy our language bringing

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:56.039
 words like that about the program your countries like South Korea that hadn't

00:40:56.039 --> 00:41:02.700
 almost nothing, right, Japan with seismological problems as varied as possible,

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:09.240
 Israel that has nothing Read ok but look at the attention they gave to education in this

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:13.799
 country one day he arrives and I gave you China the presence I am not mistaken sometimes helps

00:41:13.799 --> 00:41:19.529
 more than half of the patents two fingers the parts of the world in China hence the

00:41:19.529 --> 00:41:23.730
 people complain about you selling everything to China for who has to

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:28.650
 live better and the world is investing more

00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:33.210
 education that doesn’t invest in itself having partners that stays there indoctrinating that

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:38.010
 Talissa but she with a future This girl isn't doing anything [ __ ] doesn't know

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:44.430
 a functional illiterate will come out will do what life will be will not be

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:48.210
 today not even for you how is it going to be like the society how is it going to be

00:41:48.210 --> 00:41:53.220
 a citizen its fullness does not care What kind of [ __ ] he will go down

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:58.110
 he has an idea 12 years or you will know which is the right century

00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:03.060
 vila14 that in addition to clowning is a crime with our people what does this

00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:08.710
 people do and fight it in the past and I discovered the gay kit 'A

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:14.950
 It's not the gay's fault it's the guy I choose so What is it to be gay

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:19.690
 nobody has anything to do with it he'll be happy in his own way and we obviously

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:27.310
 right I can't go back Our police to make it official as a matter of

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:32.410
 gender think that her person is better than the other one everybody my daughter

00:42:32.410 --> 00:42:37.660
 10 years old she can be a girl I am 13 14 years old one for the tip of

00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:42.520
 Pô beach has no place what country is this I just talked about two times

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:46.180
 patents are with China and where do you sell from the more you get

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:50.530
 this through study and is indoctrinating the kids on top of that

00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:55.810
 got it bulhufas don't know anything the illiterate then daycare is struggling

00:42:55.810 --> 00:43:01.750
 because income sharing doesn't produce anything and you want to share income and we know that

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:06.020
 socialist communism in his banner is to divide the income only after that says

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:11.120
 is what PSOL managed to build has nothing more to share will live

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:18.110
 everyone in misery is it here in Brazil so this traditional school

00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:23.330
 if i have a son there i take my son there is the same as can do school

00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:28.730
 place you learn Portuguese mathematical chemistry physics etc and don't stay

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:35.120
 learning this nonsense does not have a photograph of the Colégio Pedro According to the

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:41.240
 teacher he goes out the barbadão he goes back to the end of the beach Pô Essa kids

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:45.890
 that will sustain in old age, it is useless for me to retire as Deputy 30

00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:49.610
 thousand a month or how many who retire with 30 thousand a month of service

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:55.520
 I went to the front, Brazil does not generate wealth wealth it will not have to

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:59.980
 pay these guys, everyone's on the banana So this thing, love

00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:07.510
 it is unacceptable, this school should be preached at least because the school has to do

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:12.400
 for school to admit right, but it is good to measure the teacher and the parents to take the child out of

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:16.780
 your school is not changing words that we are going to send Brazil to no one

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:20.920
 with repetitive actions what we are doing in the ministry welcoming

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:25.720
 transvestites inserting them in the job market and this is a public policy of

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:30.280
 inclusion but they changed a word I imagine yours entering a meeting of ministers and

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:34.900
 saying good afternoon ministries will turn what will change what in Brazil does not change

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:39.490
 nothing we have to change if we have prejudice discrimination with policies

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:43.620
 public and with education is not changing words not

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:49.470
 just one more question he is sad about what happens in Brazil is not

00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:55.080
 sad and sees that it sucks How is this reserve she a lot in Brazil

00:44:55.080 --> 00:45:00.180
 Still don't call prejudiced I want the whole father to want the child

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:03.930
 be better than him and this is not the way the child will be better than yours

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:09.720
 father i send to my my Armed Forces is common the only common but let

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:15.060
 many cases that the colonel the genre is a corporal's son is made up of sergeant the

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:19.980
 special picture is the end of the Aeronautics sub-official there is that I'm not

00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:26.250
 disparaging the square, right, but the square, the sub cable with a son that I'm in a

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:31.620
 academy he wants it he wants it I did revealed it and so it is that it has

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:36.090
 to be and it’s not like that, seeing it I don’t know if the Portuguese has changed

00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:41.460
 to follow everything but the guy starts the clown good morning everyone and not all of you

00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:45.230
 exists and it's good morning everyone

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:50.370
 and it starts with the clowning of this to everyone

00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:56.059
 Oh and who for example do not want another question to him

00:45:56.059 --> 00:46:01.309
 the coast on the ex-president Good night minister

00:46:01.309 --> 00:46:05.359
 beauty by the Public Ministry of Santa Catarina presents a proposal for

00:46:05.359 --> 00:46:09.940
 amendment of the Code of Criminal Procedure to prevent abuses or

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:15.319
 constraints in court hearings in cases of sexual violence yesterday the

00:46:15.319 --> 00:46:19.280
 attorney general went to Brasilia and informed that he had met with the

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:24.230
 and got support to promote these changes the Estopim of it all was

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:29.210
 the case of Mariana Ferrer a young woman who claims to have been raped in which

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:34.099
 during the hearing He claims to have been embarrassed by some questions and

00:46:34.099 --> 00:46:38.780
 comments made I wanted to know from you if that's right, your support

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:42.290
 these changes and because what exactly changes with the proposal is because the support

00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:46.069
 of the Ministry of family women and human rights side good night the beginning

00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:49.460
 good night president 'we support and the bolsonaro government has a proposal

00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:54.770
 similar in that the woman is heard only once and this testimony

00:46:54.770 --> 00:46:58.440
 of it is recorded and they are resolved the only time

00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:02.760
 the violence report she goes to the police station to give a statement after the

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.810
 After the Public Prosecutor's Office the other hearing at the

00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:11.640
 times the woman even says the same thing eight times she suffers eight times

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:16.530
 different then the bolsonaro government has already submitted a proposal is already in

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:20.010
 Congressional procedure to ensure that this woman is protected when it comes to being

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:25.260
 heard and here President allow me to say one thing what happened at that

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:30.210
 case we will not go into the merits of the case but the attitude of that lawyer we

00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:36.390
 we fail and that is not common in the judiciary the judiciary it is welcoming

00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:41.010
 our judges and prosecutors are welcoming it doesn't happen that every

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:44.910

 in Brazil it decreases a lot, the data indicate that, as a result of the average salary

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:51.200
 Initial But also from the government's own policies I wanted to ask the

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:55.640
 next now trust the Residential Minister salary your ministry

00:48:55.640 --> 00:49:02.360

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:07.520
 still due to the pandemic and if the possibility of such a second wave that

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:12.020

00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:16.760
 unemployed and we are already working with entrepreneurship we

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:22.040
 we will reinforce all actions that lead women to entrepreneurship and also

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:26.510
 young people we have a survey that says that more than wheat almost thirty percent

00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:31.520
 percent of young people do not want to go back to school they want to work so we

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:35.760

00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:51.180
 new word now also President one year entrepreneurship the woman who sells

00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:56.190
 cake she is not really interested she is a non-entrepreneur the boy who sells

00:49:56.190 --> 00:50:02.250
 popsicle bag that sells ice cream he is a human entrepreneur So we will

00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:07.230
 working in Brazil with this concept, young people who have only one computer and who

00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:11.730

00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:16.500
 we will work motivating our young people to entrepreneurship because

00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:22.320
 at first we will not have so many jobs but we can here for sure the

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:27.630
 entrepreneurship is the promotion of entrepreneurship as an outlet for

00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:32.250
 this moment of crisis that we are going through and that I believe that Brazil

00:50:32.250 --> 00:50:37.450
 will be right soon if God wants 10

00:50:37.450 --> 00:50:44.830

00:50:44.830 --> 00:50:49.900
 I went to the military's house for an army contest I stayed 15 years leaving

00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:54.910
 outside being a politician where I learned this history of damage for example

 deoxyribonucleic at the Eldorado Paulista gym with the teacher

00:51:22.319 --> 00:51:28.609
 Jackson doctor there discovered at that time the so-called DNA in the 70s then

00:51:28.609 --> 00:51:34.769
 esteem in the instruction is of quality and my teachers were not teachers

00:51:34.769 --> 00:51:42.269
 engine since he was a doctor ok or so to consume zaneide already passed away that the

00:51:42.269 --> 00:51:46.349
 professor Honória de Campinas I remember this one in the friendly and they were people

00:51:46.349 --> 00:51:50.219

00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:29.799
 something moved me but although the mouth, right? Then you find a mess like it is today

00:52:29.799 --> 00:52:35.380
 up to date it was not something that I did not do my homework I didn’t submit to a job

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.330
 with the worst of nightmares that is the delegate Patrícia who climbing the

01:04:06.330 --> 01:04:11.550
 research and becoming a real Player did flower several measures including

01:04:11.550 --> 01:04:16.530

01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:20.950

01:04:27.850 --> 01:04:34.450
 home not right a little bit right every time I just wanted to finish a sentence that you

01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:40.120
 our greatest asset, our environment, spoke here and Brazil has 851 million

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:46.870
 square kilometers eight thousand Rio Grande do Norte the indigenous area we

01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:52.330

 Patrícia in the debate, talking about how to get to know Recife, which is only for

01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:46.190
 you are not from Recife so i was elected in rio several times the paulista that you are

 let's say so only he can be a candidate something has nothing

01:06:00.410 --> 01:06:05.120
 to call more was not from Recife to Ceará, then the one who elected on the side is then

01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:11.030
 the delegate to Patrícia running for mayor in Recife if God wants not to

01:20:03.330 --> 01:20:08.130
 know because I am a politician with a lot of experience, right? Celso Russomanno in São

01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:13.860
 Paulo mayor of São Paulo lieutenant of the Aeronautics reserve was the captain of the

01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:17.250
 army is just can give a strength there I think it is

01:20:17.250 --> 01:20:20.730
 I think it’s not for the good of the municipality, it’s not for my good or for

01:20:20.730 --> 01:20:25.560
 his good is for the good of the municipality is the municipality the mayor who will work

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:31.140
 for the municipality and not to get good Electoral Governor's the same thing

01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:36.199
 speak now here São Paulo there were barbarities Mayor ordered to weld

01:20:36.199 --> 01:20:42.540
 doors is that metal runs the guy can’t open his trade for anything nor

01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:47.430
 to get in there you want to continue I can only treat you that way when

01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:52.260
 end the municipal election is this current mayor to go back to talk to the

01:20:52.260 --> 01:20:57.090
 governor asking for times talking around is because there is a very rejection

01:20:57.090 --> 01:21:01.290
 large and did not see the governor make the mayor campaigning for the current

01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:06.870
 mayor of São Paulo So look at your analysis In my case I'm asking

01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:10.290

 capital Crivella descends from Rio de Janeiro was also a senator for a long time

01:21:22.129 --> 01:21:25.420

01:21:25.420 --> 01:21:31.510
 the and now contests a difficult re-election for him yes we know it's hard caught

01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:38.170

01:21:38.170 --> 01:21:42.010
 years a big television network hitting him and almost 24 hours a

01:21:42.010 --> 01:21:47.850

 this opportunity has passed, it's halfway through the term of mayor and I

01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:31.449

 he thought it was better not to invite him Because it seems that it is not enough to finish

01:33:45.639 --> 01:33:49.690
 his term as mayor and in my opinion won Paraíba It was a

01:33:49.690 --> 01:33:53.800
 excellent mayor As I said a little while ago I have an irrigation project

01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:59.110
