 new write-off of the law but sometimes decree poorly drafted

 gold approve its its its crime law the anti crisis bill that is in the

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.320
 then the Chamber of Deputies will realize that here the

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:52.380
 word for our bond here our government leader in the chamber during

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.840
 everyone the president has instructed us to be open in government leadership in

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.919
 chamber to receive suggestions from parliamentarians federal deputies

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.430
 senators and also the Brazilian population as a whole through the day

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.440
 of deputies or directly to operate decrees that are as if they were

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.870
 laws but that this data by the president signed by the president to update

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.890
 solve regional problems so I just make myself available

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.180
 guided by the president to receive suggestions there will be a legal analysis

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.669
 President's pledged to give an answer within three weeks for you or

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:35.460
 on behalf of social security already raised from the person in relation to social security

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.440
 we had a great victory for brazil this week with a lot of work

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.200
 interesting very fruitful and very happy by felipe francischini and marcel

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:52.689
 frei 32 federal deputies were president and rapporteur in the ccj

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:55.299
 constitution and justice of the Chamber of Deputies that approved the admissibility

00:05:55.299 --> 00:05:59.559
 of the pec of the new president afterwards is a very special reference

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:03.399
 also to the mayor rodrigo maia has also done a work of

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:07.839
 articulation so that this proposal advances proposal to be very good for the

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:12.039
 country and also the minister nicks who also helps in the articulation has made a

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:16.089
 very interesting job to thank all the deputies who voted for this

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:19.659
 admissibility there was a very large convergence but

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:25.959
 will approve them with 48 votes in favor and 18 in the last attempt was 31 to 20

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:29.409
 so we are moving forward to build our social security start now to

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:33.099
 finish the work on the special commission i wanted to congratulate the

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:37.539
 deputy marcelo ramos a lawyer at the amazonas pr party

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:42.339
 who is the committee chairman the rapporteur samuel moreira psdb de são

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:45.759
 Paulo who has a certainty for an excellent job

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:49.659
 I see that it is not being able to speak in decree we are not open to those who think

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:54.399
 decree that can be improved we are available to receive these

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:58.149
 suggestions obviously we will look especially at the

00:06:58.149 --> 00:07:03.360
 secretariat for legal affairs and if it's a car, we will have it for three weeks

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:09.009
 correct the decree whose day today was not to vote today was not with

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:13.539
 version a suggestion annually we here in brazil via

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:17.199
 decree we set apart from not condemning the period

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:21.429
 so not for example deputy joão campos looked for and all the arguments

00:07:21.429 --> 00:07:27.519
 by the end of daylight saving time we analyzed this suggestion joão campos

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:33.099
 we submitted the presentation by the minister of mines and energy which is a great event and

00:07:33.099 --> 00:07:38.649
 he technically informed us that they survived it was no longer necessary

00:07:38.649 --> 00:07:41.410
 because the type of gas the energy in the account is currently giving

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:47.470
 15-hour producer then trained to reduce energy consumption and the part

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:52.920
 the other has to be has to do with the health of our biological clock

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:56.320
 the conclusion of our staff we consulted in the sense that so a

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.500
 time for a lot of people hindered their performance

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:04.780
 the day worked in his life he was more hunted at the time he would go

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:10.870
 working had a problem so our decision I'm not coming we played well

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:14.890
 like all parliamentarians all the parliamentarians who had to bear in mind

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:20.290
 today on the occasion of easy credit rating but when you take it here then don't

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.680
 we signed with these people who had proposed that the keys

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:29.470
 fernandes da bahia luiz nishimori de do paraná luiz

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:35.740
 ovando gross thick legal 11 of goiás so this year we will not have the one with the

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:41.080
 admiration that depends on people right on the population that all people who

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:45.610
 did on the internet was always above 70% the number of

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:56.140
 people who voted for the independent the joke the man under the sea here

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.390
 our recipe that he will talk about

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:03.640
 on the one hand I’m going to pass now there are three interventions here in our dear andré

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:20.440
 mendonça is a boy at the moment is our andré mendonça who made it clear

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:26.380
 that this position of the supreme who is going to speak now that involves censorship of

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:32.740
 crusoe magazine has nothing to do with it was

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:40.450
 defending in the general counsel of the union the right of supreme minister

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:46.590
 propose is to abolish the restlessness taking into account the internal regulations

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:51.649
 efe he was very criticized is some thought that I had determined him

00:09:51.649 --> 00:09:56.000
 that there is no boss and employee here we are in the same role as the same

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.029
 standard of the beautiful bar and today ended up defending that then the supreme decision

00:10:02.029 --> 00:10:08.110
 to speak the restless regarding the published pregnant his wife to the point

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:13.070
 possible for this one thanks for the opportunity to be here today to you

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:21.200
 that assists us if a mess a lot of people think that there is no longer a single

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.149
 defends the executive is not true the ge goal by the constitution has to

00:10:26.149 --> 00:10:31.820
 defend the executive the legislative the judiciary the court of accounts of the union

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:37.610
 the federal public ministry itself we for example today represent and

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:42.589
 we will defend the euro also won a lawsuit that needs

00:10:42.589 --> 00:10:47.510
 president lula moved against him to act what does helton's defense do

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:54.980
 and in the case of the supreme we do not go into the merit to know if the way is a censorship

00:10:54.980 --> 00:11:01.070
 whether or not it is not the role of language that does not act in the investigation that acts in the investigation

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:05.870
 is in the criminal area it generated it she was summoned to

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:11.390
 manifest in order to analyze whether the president of the supreme may or may not

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:15.740
 have initiated an investigation and it is in this sense that we manifest ourselves as the

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:21.920
 supreme bylaws have the force of law and the bylaws provide that the

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:27.030
 president can institute whatever we did the morning

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:32.460
 in this sense what we hope is that the supreme that will soon be able to define

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:38.460
 this more clearly so that the whole society has the final answer of the

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:42.210
 supreme federal court itself was not in that sense that we

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:47.730
 we express is everyone's consensus whether press freedom is a value

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:53.370
 non-negotiable and we didn’t get into that and minister alexandre himself

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:59.250
 de moraes kelly knew that revoking her own decision was not a

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:05.130
 technical manifestation in an institutional and constitutional duty that the

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:11.190
 we had to do in that specific situation on two more occasions and

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:15.090
 will say these things are new here for sure you will like the

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:20.970
 news that I received this morning the girl and the mother of eight years of age to

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:26.370
 my new city and cinema on the occasion of Easter that we call here not

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:32.990
 understand the kids I never asked will the palm trees who deserve it

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:40.170
 no she complemented obviously she is flamenco regretted the fact of having

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:44.100
 lost the first game the flamengo hit with the brazilian cheer for the flamengo

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:49.110
 who can believe that it is true to say that I presented with the Flemish shirt

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:55.620
 is pending the father and mother had a lawyer is also is one and on Saturday we

00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:02.070
 we will visit there in the structural planned the girl's family because she suffered

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:07.350
 again it is a lot because there were a lot of people understood that she didn’t have

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:12.030
 education greet me or if you don't like it because the father spoke publicly

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:15.630
 who voted and not all this mess all your clothes

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:20.460
 eighteen candidates want to be the central target of her teacher the director of

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:25.760
 school telling a problem her leaving school was paulo did the subject

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:32.370
 wrong is in addition the use of more printed works republic carlos there was

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:37.290
 something here that reverberated in Brazil all compare me even because the girl in

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:40.800
 time in figueiredo and with all due respect in your opinion I have never been

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.790
 with this new unit which the political maturity this matter for

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:48.690
 know if it will hold there what I advocate here prone to shop a lot

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:52.680
 child already has a certain maturity understanding things not only

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:58.080
 depth we here in our city never have to visit our

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:06.660
 girl and doyle the purpose of the visit is exactly to undo this misunderstanding

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:12.140
 pay your ball that loses the game will be sao paulo a few hours later

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:20.280
 feeling sorry, acknowledged the error but we have access to it

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.390
 in the other games of pieces they were of 11 days does not form improvements and touched on

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:29.850
 day out so as not to be in são paulo almost all the others then in the matter

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:36.360
 or publish I have to be a good job no let's not go get it says do

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:41.160
 really and if that tremendous injustice done to a minor child you

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.960
 tell the truth the company has a certain company but a fact like that exposing

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:50.339
 publicly it's another child that is protected by the state of california

00:14:50.339 --> 00:14:54.749
 can happen already I contacted the reporter from the state of são paulo look

00:14:54.749 --> 00:15:00.329
 accompanying our visit our idea is to retaliate no one belongs to the truckers and

00:15:00.329 --> 00:15:05.579
 make this girl feel happy and go back to the classroom as

00:15:05.579 --> 00:15:14.699
 any other child we will open a space here our total

00:15:14.699 --> 00:15:20.040
 and in the new minister of education today I visited their waiting very well

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:26.519
 received there we talked like every month to new lines and people of 30 minutes of

00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:32.100
 conversation and exchange of information and I prefer that the minister himself is

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:37.259
 one thing that most interested us about this visit is missing for you to speak to the people

00:15:37.259 --> 00:15:42.449
 as an example the proof of the enemy and all the measures you are taking in this

00:15:42.449 --> 00:15:47.910
 their initiation in that important they said that education always thank you

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:51.930
 president good night everyone and the message that I

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:58.259
 wanted to move into this new world that we see we are dealing with a

00:15:58.259 --> 00:16:02.970
 a tiger's friend is going through the big transition while having internet

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:07.050
 while there are social media that don’t set the tone, we’re going to change

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:11.970
 much more the fame as we are communicating with the society with which we

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:15.179
 why this instrument is important

00:16:15.179 --> 00:16:21.089
 the traditional media and also a little bit of our concerns raised to

00:16:21.089 --> 00:16:29.040
 possibility that there is no urgency we in the government are concerned with

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:35.490
 leave you there in your house, sir lady in peace to take care of the

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:40.769
 problems that you already have day to day either have to stop where I have

00:16:40.769 --> 00:16:44.490
 who run after and health problems employment

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:49.470
 so our task is to avoid any surprises

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:54.000
 negative in that sense the problem has every day everyone has their

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.180
 our job is to prevent it from reaching you

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:02.580
 there was a possibility that possibility was removed from aaa

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:08.880
 the tco was very partner and understand the problem and thus at risk of not even having

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:16.020
 if the year is totally over then people are going to provide these young people or

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:21.120
 older people will need to continue studying and then a tip

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:27.630
 that I'm going to pass on to you is I think that in very controversial ideological issues

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:32.130
 as in the past it didn’t happen this year we

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:39.090
 my suggestion focus more on the technique of writing text interpretation

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:45.210
 focus a lot on math sciences and really an aspect that we want

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:51.000
 develop scientific knowledge a person's ability to develop

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.620
 new skills this is the recommendation is when the visit

00:17:55.620 --> 00:18:01.050
 to the president was there was very welcome including tour by the employees of the mec

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:05.160
 despite all this deconstruction time they try to create our deploy our

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.470
 image the president was very well received by

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:13.290
 all employees technical offenses analysts the simplest people

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:18.270
 were at the reception the president came out was to hug them he went up

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:21.150
 went to talk to esther that he has a series of plans we have

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:27.330
 many positive changes that will happen soon all of them the majority of

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:31.760
 population obviously has good things when we are going to change but everything

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:35.750
 within the law everyone's right will be respected

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:42.550
 our goal is to serve the population with a lot this government arrived here with

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:48.800
 great majority of the population supporting there in the ballot box but we play at 100% of the

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:52.700
 opposition our goal is to respect and give back to the

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:58.060
 population the tax that she for education is paid

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:03.650
 for the tax that you have when you buy the cell phone not be for your line

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:08.420
 impulse phone in your home's light has a post

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:14.090
 this tax goes from the federal state and municipal government to develop

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:19.490
 among other things that in my case my education portfolio, we are 5 and

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:23.390
 improving the quality of education in brazil is a large amount of

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:28.670
 taxes that we have already collected this is my message study for real

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:36.410
 and study things yes ideological direction as there was in the past will not

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:46.580
 change has already changed and will change more and more calmly without those at heights with nothing that

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:51.500
 messing up calling the president is exactly what takes a man with a woman in the

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:57.350
 difficult situation in which he finds himself is the knowledge that we want in the absence

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:01.910
 of the line our children are better than

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:05.570
 us this situation with all certainty of the father

00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:09.080
 and a mother who has a child for what happened after finishing a technical course

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:14.240
 or higher with the knowledge baggage he

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.620
 can have that function much of the day the tie considered

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:23.960
 there are a lot of people finished college to put a paper on the wall

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:30.190
 just good writing is not important the person did not know how to do

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:34.660
 that makes it clear that in the past I took a technical course she was active but

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:38.650
 this phase of life to fix television and refrigerator

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:42.100
 I once found a more modern classmate course is he doing here in

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:53.080
 Brazil you come here to do nothing you are there because when the resource will come back

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:57.340
 because spoiling a journey never even charged me which will prevent the

00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.700
 work so i went to learn to fix january that with all respect to the

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:12.730
 professionals have no difficulty with washing machines or outside and a lot

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:17.350
 much more than people have a college degree with all due respect to the course by

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:26.620
 that I see I don’t agree and I think the government’s role is to respect money

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:31.420
 of the taxpayer so what do we have to teach children to

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:38.110
 young people are the first skills and being able to read and write and do math

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:43.540
 the second most important thing a craft craft that manages income person well

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:48.340
 be with her family that improves the society around her

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.880
 japan my country our people lewis president

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:55.900
 Japan is a much cleaner country in Brazil

00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:02.650
 he's taking public money from the college taxpayer are

00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:07.450
 seen as faculties for a person who is already very political or elite like

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:15.820
 philosophy can study philosophy where own money and japan reinforces that

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:21.130
 this money that goes to college as a sociology philosophy he puts

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:29.010
 in colleges that generate return from in fact veterinary nursing engineering

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:34.919
 medicine but again president who is in the current courses does not need

00:22:34.919 --> 00:22:38.309
 worrying anything is going to be their right is going to be

00:22:38.309 --> 00:22:42.210
 respected everything follows normal life faith is not

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:46.799
 worry the only thing that we can talk about here we don't agree

00:22:46.799 --> 00:22:50.669
 with several things that have been done in the last 20 years

00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:56.669
 so Brazil is far from its potential and then it starts to change

00:22:56.669 --> 00:23:03.480
 is a minister of education has his twitter in use speak he does not hear is

00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:09.179
 difficult for me it’s easy society looks like I’m from artillery relieves itself

00:23:09.179 --> 00:23:12.990
 imagine the other sister souls there since he was

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:16.590
 japan had to roll we are going to japan in a few minutes

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:22.230
 weeks of the g-20 meeting and I am preparing that last time I would not

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:26.220
 get it because I want to buy jewelery of course

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:31.169
 look how far we have come is just that we have an identical alliance here

00:23:31.169 --> 00:23:37.409
 mine of gold more or less 30 an alliance of that man of four

00:23:37.409 --> 00:23:43.620
 twelve hundred reais, right, 40% more expensive, because that looks, just look at prices.

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:49.169
 so look at jewelry stores and say it’s already used in the country and we have

00:23:49.169 --> 00:23:54.330
 now the circus go out on winning an alloy an alloy steel just iron steel the

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:57.539
 building structure is r 20 man because it is more resistant it is more

00:23:57.539 --> 00:24:05.130
 known in china case board of the 31 now little 399 pipeline towards

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:09.389
 Germany is using a convicted car key and as I said now there are

00:24:09.389 --> 00:24:14.519
 little bit that it is more rigid right but it is more resistant a certain flexibility

00:24:14.519 --> 00:24:21.299
 as the first first is the idea of ​​that entity how much stronger do you use

00:24:21.299 --> 00:24:25.980
 less the lighter in being lighter you

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:31.080
 spends less fuel to take a destination similar to our car here is

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:35.120
 quite heavy so here twitter us ourselves

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:40.529
 before I leave the safe I will return here is not the subject

00:24:40.529 --> 00:24:44.750
 all are important but the third most important since the end here of

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:50.460
 andré miele looks only he is a lawyer has one by one

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:55.860
 political party was organized for 19 in the case is to have an action at the supreme and

00:24:55.860 --> 00:25:01.769
 crying at the question of gambling is to vote against his message the party

00:25:01.769 --> 00:25:07.529
 when collecting the correction of the misdemeanor she wants to legalize the game in brazil

00:25:07.529 --> 00:25:16.440
 our minister that our lawyer left to present her position that

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:21.659
 the government's position in the bars but nothing imposed on me on this issue and the

00:25:21.659 --> 00:25:26.490
 that I am more important to take into account the changes the problem is that if I have

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:35.250
 decided to stop being against monthly that is made by the chamber and the senate that

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:40.620
 the subtitles only, we can’t together in the series that the judiciary nor

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:47.130
 jesus as well as him a short time ago and it was highly praised to defend a position that

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:52.110
 it is not the government with little residence but it is a right thing when the supreme

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:56.700
 is on vote week 4 to 0 they want to justify a new book

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:03.840
 as if he were born, that is, the supreme is resurrecting that infamous plc

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:13.039
 122 was treated in the past that parliament decided that by failing to legislate

00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:19.090
 why not taking a position is also part of parliament that's it

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:23.380
 so andré please talk about gambling in the

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:28.090
 Brazil that you took your protection in the government is with the supreme court

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:31.080
 previous federal thank you president it's just a matter

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:36.640
 important social that affects the day-to-day off in several ways

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:42.059
 the first game of chance is a gateway to money laundering

00:26:42.059 --> 00:26:48.610
 illicit activities computing illicit assets then has this

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:54.250
 aspect related to crime another important social aspect generates

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:57.370
 addiction how many stories have you heard of

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:02.799
 people who have become addicted to losing their assets and leaving their family in

00:27:02.799 --> 00:27:08.380
 misery without your child being able to study properly taking money home

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:14.290
 occurred with education I we cannot accept that the game of chance

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:20.160
 will be lawful and that is what we set ourselves up for in the supreme court

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:25.500
 arguing that there is an illegality in the game of chance

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:31.090
 we defend that we will continue to defend but even if there was some

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:35.770
 possibility of discussing the matter would fit, as the President said to the

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:39.340
 national congress then president we stick to that

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:45.669
 defense and both the supreme and the illegality the illegality of the game of chance

00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:49.360
 he will vote on one last case shortly

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.779
 I mean for you to have breakfast

00:27:51.779 --> 00:27:55.559
 the table today when kim journalism is half right

00:27:55.559 --> 00:28:02.340
 in the afternoon not doing 76 but most of them here today are magazines and I asked

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:06.179
 authorization for us we filmed everything asked for authorization for all of them agreed

00:28:06.179 --> 00:28:10.109
 that we could publish is almost an hour of chat

00:28:10.109 --> 00:28:15.419
 we are hitting here by carlos here who has a channel on youtube for hours

00:28:15.419 --> 00:28:19.019
 he will publish who has time I think it is worth getting to know a little bit

00:28:19.019 --> 00:28:24.210
 journalist starts to miss fighting with exceptional and also the

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:29.159
 first question right at the beginning a journalist you asked

00:28:29.159 --> 00:28:34.229
 next is because it's been on twitter for three days and facebook is sure the car

00:28:34.229 --> 00:28:40.339
 is blocking is censoring you to achieve until recently you were

00:28:40.339 --> 00:28:45.899
 massacring in pacaembu and saying that I should rule doesn’t stay on twitter ok

00:28:45.899 --> 00:28:51.389
 now three days later leave the time for me to return well without any problem of course

00:28:51.389 --> 00:28:55.739
 that your function of your freedom to expose your ideas on twitter where

00:28:55.739 --> 00:29:00.119
 it was an account that this war is worthwhile if you have the time, right

00:29:00.119 --> 00:29:07.919
 watch survivor on our youtube channel will now pass the young man who even

00:29:07.919 --> 00:29:11.190
 the only time my indication always on that right

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:18.570
 to the secretariat the secretary of fisheries who will talk a little bit about the new

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:22.769
 channel with action by thinkers that story according to the defense has a lot

00:29:22.769 --> 00:29:27.450
 fraud there and we have a little purchase until next time

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:31.460
 he will talk to him better than me

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:37.889
 thank you very much for the opportunity is personal

00:29:37.889 --> 00:29:41.820
 last week the president missed that issue that we're

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:46.619
 dealing from the first day of government that the issue of closed insurance right

00:29:46.619 --> 00:29:54.419
 there behind 2014 and it was repeated there are indeed the tests in 2017 the statistics

00:29:54.419 --> 00:30:02.609
 polls harassed the union's general controllership is that a 66% detector for

00:30:02.609 --> 00:30:09.539
 more is fraud condition the winners ie people are getting a

00:30:09.539 --> 00:30:17.159
 benefit that was not right for them is we want to take a benefit from the

00:30:17.159 --> 00:30:22.289
 fisherman there is no benefit we want to export so it looks good

00:30:22.289 --> 00:30:26.070
 clear but obvious that we were hitchhiking with

00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:28.499
 our education minister has not yet spoken

00:30:28.499 --> 00:30:32.759
 we want to respect the public money respect the taxes that the

00:30:32.759 --> 00:30:38.759
 Brazilian paid program, it is not possible that a social program without at least 66

00:30:38.759 --> 00:30:42.929
 cent is fraud is our quick money for people who are not

00:30:42.929 --> 00:30:47.219
 fishermen so what happens a group and it's already

00:30:47.219 --> 00:30:51.869
 led by be it involves other federal government games

00:30:51.869 --> 00:30:59.070
 aaaah knew is inss ministry of economics our secretary of

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:05.249
 aquaculture and fisheries there is even ministry of justice federal police

00:31:05.249 --> 00:31:11.700
 so, passing through a study task force, you know, because unfortunately in the old

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:15.950
 Brazil since 2014, if you were talking look, there is a problem with these benefits

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:22.499
 we will correct harvest 2017, that is three years later, we will repeat the same

00:31:22.499 --> 00:31:27.029
 information so the subject is not new the subject of the government jair bolsonaro is a

00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:32.760
 government is an old issue that we are simply dealing with is with

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:40.100
 respect to the issue of taxation in brazil so what will be done is we

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:46.049
 let's make a new system it will be ready until the beginning of June in the mountains

00:31:46.049 --> 00:31:50.179
 and this system we will do a national re-registration of

00:31:50.179 --> 00:31:54.840
 beneficiaries is from closed insurance many people that week after the

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.230
 lake last week the president contacted the secretariat

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:00.450
 through also on social networks filming

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:03.870
 look i feel safe closed but i don't want the cool dad i don't want to do

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:07.230
 wrong thing like I don't know if I have a right or

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:12.929
 not the second defense so a very simple and very easy tip for you to know if

00:32:12.929 --> 00:32:19.860
 you are entitled to closed insurance you your main economy is the party you are

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:25.980
 fisherman you are artisanal fisherman you depend on fishing for a living or you

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:30.620
 is a doctor right as we saw here in the database is a doctor and dentist

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:37.110
 unfortunately there military mayors councilmen mechanics a lot of people

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:42.929
 there are even fishing colonies that amaze you in places that people

00:32:42.929 --> 00:32:47.220
 there's not even water to drink so we need to work for you

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:51.990
 have any idea I think the youngest worker in Brazil is a fisherman that we

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:56.669
 we have in our register people with seven years of age a seal according to defense I

00:32:56.669 --> 00:33:00.600
 I think the oldest person in the world is Brazilian is provided also has a

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:05.490
 person in the 148-year-old registrations received second closed

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:10.649
 that would be comical if it weren't tragic if it wasn't for the disrespect one day the

00:33:10.649 --> 00:33:14.490
 public so we will do this re-registration and we want to give

00:33:14.490 --> 00:33:18.149
 opportunity we don't want to do witch hunt not

00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:21.880
 we want to bring citizen problems well many people were

00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:27.580
 induced there to receive to enroll in closed insurance is not our goal

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:32.080
 is three million reais almost 3 billion reais of the money of the

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:37.240
 Brazil plans to build the road the game continued hospitals daycare centers as many

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:41.320
 things that we look like investing in culture in fish farming and so many things

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:45.520
 who are unduly in favor of people and capital

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:50.320
 there is still an even more harmful aspect of the closed insurance issue he

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:54.610
 account for retirement time ie people today are receiving the

00:33:54.610 --> 00:34:01.570
 wrongly closed 66% and then later on in old age they will still enjoy

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:07.299
 of retirement what we were not entitled to so we are doing the

00:34:07.299 --> 00:34:09.940
 registration of people we are hearing about

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:15.190
 jorge how do we do so i don't work asks that i already worked i went

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:19.629
 induced we know that many people was induced is unfortunately in

00:34:19.629 --> 00:34:23.290
 election times don't know days like what we can do

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:27.040
 you will look for your fishing colony to have a great partner

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:32.919
 our colonies federations confederations you will look for them and say look I

00:34:32.919 --> 00:34:37.990
 I am no longer a fisherman or I have never been a fisherman.

00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:41.770
 ideological do not want problems with the Brazilian justice please remove the

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:47.609
 name because who provides the list of names for the inss are the entities

00:34:47.609 --> 00:34:54.510
 related to the inss, which are the colonies, answer something so I

00:34:54.510 --> 00:35:00.970
 information unproven by what appears to be a state the respective government the

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:05.170
 governor had faith he believed he well understood

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:12.300
 is is up to six months to a year and four months is a family of three

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:21.740
 friend throughout the year and we have an obligation to ensure public use and

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:26.119
 combat this to him i was very attacked during my

00:35:26.119 --> 00:35:32.270
 campaign will not end the second of life and by coincidence or do not want to

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:36.410
 go into details here but I lost only in the state of brazil taking the

00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:42.349
 northeast region I lost exactly in that state of the order to select the state

00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:46.430
 where it has roll and concentration to benefit defense insurance

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:50.869
 you can see that it even uses public money if a car is you go back to

00:35:50.869 --> 00:35:55.640
 represent someone saw me I paid at the time will for governor found

00:35:55.640 --> 00:36:01.790
 I'm sure I'm going to lose my mandate now, we will pay 43 billion for

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:07.820
 at 36 almost 3 billion the expenditure on five defenses is almost two million is

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:12.859
 talk and with that money if you buy a lot of people if you bought the election is election

00:36:12.859 --> 00:36:19.640
 for deputy councilman and even more for Czech than January when he

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:23.869
 stepped on Sunday at the beach accusing me of the environmental crime agent who was

00:36:23.869 --> 00:36:26.900
 assessed on a day and hour that he had put in.

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:31.040
 the presence panel here so he wasn’t there having a conclusion has the

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:35.470
 governor and to had as a mother I

00:36:37.329 --> 00:36:51.020
 believe that created the municipal closed insurance apply the lion and municipal

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:54.210
 [Song]

00:36:56.059 --> 00:37:00.079
 today and perhaps defended everything is done irregularly

00:37:00.079 --> 00:37:04.509
 just to complement a little information that I ended up remembering

00:37:04.509 --> 00:37:12.499
 personal 70% 81 of Brazilians use internet 70% these are statistics

00:37:12.499 --> 00:37:17.869
 however it is fishing personnel from riverside personnel in the corners of the

00:37:17.869 --> 00:37:23.239
 Brazil often do not have knowledge they do not have access to technology so many

00:37:23.239 --> 00:37:27.439
 people also didn’t ask who will make this registration the registration will be

00:37:27.439 --> 00:37:32.059
 through the colonies federations confederations and in the future you also

00:37:32.059 --> 00:37:35.119
 will be able the fisherman will be able to make his

00:37:35.119 --> 00:37:38.119
 register today when you are going to declare your income tax

00:37:38.119 --> 00:37:42.589
 you cannot make your lawyer your accountant your brother in the future but the

00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:46.489
 brief future i will speak a very distant future later this year the researcher

00:37:46.489 --> 00:37:51.769
 you can also do it if you prefer, but we as a government

00:37:51.769 --> 00:37:55.729
 federal we will remain with sells is with the

00:37:55.729 --> 00:38:00.529
 colonies federations confederations the only detail we will start the

00:38:00.529 --> 00:38:04.849
 re-enrolled by was that of the federations confederations which in turn

00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:09.829
 you have to do the meeting minutes again, you have to do the board again

00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:14.959
 the whole rite I don’t know in my head but you don’t know why there are

00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:19.039
 some of these entities that do not make their elections do not have their board

00:38:19.039 --> 00:38:23.689
 elected for a long time because we are going to start the stepfather for these entities

00:38:23.689 --> 00:38:29.390
 because they will be responsible for the people who were benefited then the

00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:36.019
 person who will declare to aaa is a fisherman will have to answer it because it is a

00:38:36.019 --> 00:38:40.849
 self-declaration today for a declaratory act and the colonies that know

00:38:40.849 --> 00:38:48.009
 who are really fishermen and fishermen and who are not on my part

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:57.030
 the world would watch the episodes to see in the newspapers hear on the radio a number

00:38:57.030 --> 00:39:03.000
 vehicle accidents of deaths in this holy week holiday

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:10.980
 we had 11% less accidents and 28% less death if it weren't for

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:15.359
 framed majored who would be responsible who for sure I

00:39:15.359 --> 00:39:20.970
 because they are talking I am going to make a decision with our minister of

00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:28.770
 culture is the earthquake of us is no longer accepting the proliferation of radars in the

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:34.470
 Brazil that a slot machine who assembled the industry and tried his way when

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:36.630
 I talked to him and showed him a little over a month

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:42.270
 eight thousand and said that new concussions in Brazil plus 8 thousand points

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:46.950
 it's our uncle's business that we noticed I started to notice if fighting equals

00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:53.730
 to leave the decision with him is that the federal contracts and highways please

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:59.340
 federal gods we are not going to renew this contract and i will put an end to

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:05.490
 drastically a fine industry maybe the withdrawal

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:09.660
 no radars were quoted had time to take positive action on the issue of

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:14.930
 number of accidents and deaths in brazil

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:19.910
 the last very important matter

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:29.150
 [Song]

00:40:32.539 --> 00:40:37.579
 china and to publish for years the union it can also has force of law and effect

00:40:37.579 --> 00:40:42.859
 binding president ie all federal public administration will have

00:40:42.859 --> 00:40:46.910
 to follow the guidelines of the opinion what I said during my campaign

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:52.910
 angel the campaign also transparent as I didn’t talk about black box the

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:57.529
 bnds has improved deserves who better like that

00:40:57.529 --> 00:41:02.719
 we want something that is worth it all the public sensation cannot take that

00:41:02.719 --> 00:41:08.209
 story of look I cannot this ministry

00:41:08.209 --> 00:41:13.729
 with that official bank the state company cannot then andré had the initiative

00:41:13.729 --> 00:41:18.739
 together with your colleagues in the union force and do something like that here that

00:41:18.739 --> 00:41:21.739
 I'm going to do it now but first I want him to explain it is actually with

00:41:21.739 --> 00:41:26.509
 technical language with I prefer by all what is it that I'm coming up now in

00:41:26.509 --> 00:41:31.549
 first hand for all of you as president a very relevant opinion

00:41:31.549 --> 00:41:40.429
 important that has the bias to change the life of much of what the citizen

00:41:40.429 --> 00:41:46.999
 has come today that corruption for a long time the organs of

00:41:46.999 --> 00:41:52.339
 control the one who supervises the money cuba public ministry in tcu a

00:41:52.339 --> 00:41:58.819
 general controllership of the union the federal police all these bodies had not

00:41:58.819 --> 00:42:06.589
 free access to public money to the money that was going to be used is in

00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:11.029
 school in health in education that we're saying that this opinion

00:42:11.029 --> 00:42:19.519
 president that from the signature of the lord published in the official diary all

00:42:19.519 --> 00:42:25.729
 the control bodies federal police courts of accounts

00:42:25.729 --> 00:42:32.419
 they will have free access to public money meaning the money has been

00:42:32.419 --> 00:42:36.580
 passed on 10 hello to the municipality

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:42.040
 there the state of the union these control bodies will have access

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:48.460
 free will not be able to be defended that it cannot have access because of the secrecy

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:54.190
 do not have bank secrecy from this president signature on

00:42:54.190 --> 00:43:00.520
 in relation to federal public money, you will now go to the map

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:05.620
 from that to every time for example someone within the impression of

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:12.340
 money for vat own loophole for construction bank promoter

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:18.460
 the control bodies will be able to have access to all the documentation as it was

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:25.810
 deposited because it was deposited who received it because they received what acts they

00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:30.160
 are involved if they justified justified

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:36.220
 in other words, everything that had been happening illegal under the

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:39.730
 cloths now the public money we're going to have

00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:46.000
 how to identify why it is there for whoever leaves president to sign an act

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:52.660
 this is very simple but it takes political will can you

00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:58.690
 having courage and political will as a citizen and as a lawyer for the state

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:04.840
 Brazilian we can only thank the personal courage you are having to say

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:10.770
 now that the citizen's money the court of auditors to the police

00:44:10.770 --> 00:44:17.010
 the controllership will be entitled to the claim because this public money is being

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:22.290
 destined for that purpose is a new level

00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:26.550
 a few years ago president said he will file a lawsuit against the bank's

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:33.510
 brazil at the request of the federal police the federal police can see in the account of the

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:40.080
 Banco do Brasil for those who were paying the money that we citizens pay

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:45.420
