00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.820
Hi good morning good to Amazonas Manaus Manaus tourism Good night Tuesday ten

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.359
 November 9:00 here the Fabiana interpreter of pounds EA right I my

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.430
 colleague of Clínica Agulhas Negras with her not Menezes candidate for mayor for

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.599
 Manaus is fine Today I made a pronouncement no

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:37.220
 was talking about tourism Alina in the presidency was a speech a little

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.860
 long but I think it’s worth watching it soon I’m going to put

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.210
 our Facebook page where there was more to nothing in the Turismo Brasil collection as

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.540
 difficulties and some I think the beauty president alone can I solve

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.860
 things writing stuff you man be mayor there in Manaus you for

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.940
 will often depend on the powder camera will depend on the prosecutor

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.309
 will depend on having a good acceptance for the father, with a lot of that curve

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.289
 problem poses a problem to be solved in the neighborhood on the 10th of November

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:14.930
 10 part of that you're going to have that he entered birthday birthday has

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:23.060
 So it depends on a lot of things and tourism is the way

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.460
 and how to say easier easier less difficult for you to succeed in Brazil

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.960
 now the big problem are the obstacles environmental issues like

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.860
 I explained my crossing today of the Bay of Angra that I have a dream of

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.720
 transform the region into a great Tourist Center here in Brazil but you have

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.700
 to revoke a decree and to revoke apron decree it’s not me decree

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.520
 The Brazilian parliament will most certainly have it there in the State of

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:03.399
 Amazonas does not have a municipality that is an apa that is an ecological station

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.450
 that could have some change, right, any change in that for you to

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.530
 favor tourism even to bring about the preservation of this area, which often

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.410
 personal piece that you demarcated is solved there are no cheaper ways for

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.040
 over someone invading that area and causing a

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.140
 it is very big if there is someone living there waiting for tourism that person is not going to

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.540
 obviously collaborate with the environmental issue so I'm here today for

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.430
 Colonel Menezes is my colleague at the Military Academy of Agulhas Negras

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.920
 candidate for mayor in Manaus had a pass by his sensual family I had

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.290
 we stayed there for 16 months, the president who only talked about tourism is one of the vectors, you know?

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.959
 that we consider to be complementary to the economy of both our state and the

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.480
 city ​​of Manaus because tourism is all about us there, right? You know there are

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.590
 United States cities there and Las Vegas that created a city and it was the

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.480
 desert and create a tourist city there in Manaus in Amazonas like all right your

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.250
 knows that area well we have it Our natural vocation there with certainty that

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.050
 we have some obstacles now with this new one of yours

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:29.140
 we want exactly that, jehovah has a lot of water used, so Tarcísio

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.540
 last month, the condition of seaplanes was fixed, but if few people saw the

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.080
 hydroplane here in Brazil I talk I never saw you already came here in Brazil I

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.630
 I’ve never seen it. You’ve never seen the plane from Brazil

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.320
 there is no if there is so much water here there is something you are hindering having

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.630
 been tidying it up so the circulation of the plane from Brazil if it

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.250
 much easier and you who live in the region of a lot of water Amazon any

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.930
 europort airport location that this will benefit from is very will help to show

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.700
 those who come from outside show that the Amazon basin does not catch fire it catches fire

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.180
 Amazonas neighborhood doesn’t pick up because it’s only the whole wave against us because the

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.440
 very great economic interest, especially in the rooms, right expressions of

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.350
 agribusiness but it also gave hope Of the same moment Hope President like me

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.000
 I was asking, we were 16 and Suframa and we had our first

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.350
 year of management there the Manaus President Pole with your support here from

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.960
 very intense federal government we had the highest revenue, right of the last 32

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.090
 years ago we could also get some from Mia now this year and today the numbers that

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.930
 we have both the State and the City Hall in relation to Public Management

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.160
 they are favorable exactly because of the work that was Governor and

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.880
 Mayor closed everything not next everything more or less was today is closed today

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.460
 open a little more the city remains restricted many people knew each other

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.570
 we saw each other as we were unaware until today so in my opinion I always

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.919
 I advocated vertical isolation and not this horizontal one, everyone stays at home

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:15.500
 because I said back there we don't have two problems the virus and the jobs and

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.660
 we must take care of both simultaneously with the same responsibility

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.040
 I caught Tocantins a lot with Tocantins

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.120
 it means that I am concerned with the life that I mocked the Dead that

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.470
 whole story that doesn't know that this great peace the media makes against us

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.570
 today we came here and the isolation, right, the confinement Lock

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:42.540
 Down things that you couldn't do the way it was to see that that isolate the

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.170
 elderly person at home i'm elderly that up to five years old must have isolated in

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:51.270
 home, right? Although I always said, when I catch it live, I won't have

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.600
 problem for sure because the best way you have to face

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.530
 you will ask for health for health too the staff mocked me too right

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:02.190
 little athlete body I didn’t feel anything man can feel like not feeling anything

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:08.430
 now who had obesity community age problems there regrettably

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.140
 these people had a lot of difficulty in some died what our

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.850
 we regret more is it is life is reality now I will leave everyone at home right

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:23.250
 regardless of the age independent he has as a skill or did not take and

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:29.370
 mass unemployment in Brazil one that does not appear appears more or less 1

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.430
 lost million of jobs is formal signed portfolio

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.950
 the most employed the forecast to reach 10 million or more that we had measures

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:46.840
 right of employment protection and the informal ones you calculate 38 40 million informal

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:51.490
 is the guy who sells cat barbecue is the one who sells water at Praia Verde a

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.570
 target on the signal on the signal there from Manaus quite a lot of people's faith were

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.800
 practically high student losing everything understood everything where she entered remember

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:05.170
 reason that some even complain about, it was five months of leaving real sense for

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:10.890
 more than 60 million people as there were people who earned twice that

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:17.440
 some people with mothers it reaches the next 50 I saw a month or in debt

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:23.269
 same is what saved the economy and there in Manaus not if he can count on you

00:07:23.269 --> 00:07:28.219
 many people who received the celebration It is true President and this helped a lot to

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:33.949
 population of the city of the state I we have always visited the communities in

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:39.110
 the last 120 days, mainly in the eastern zone of the North Zone of Manaus, which are

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:44.449
 most populous of the most needy people and we have seen it, right there Always at the doors

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:51.319
 of the banks and people thanking them for the fact that they received from the

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:55.789
 federal government this support was extremely important for the economy

00:07:55.789 --> 00:08:01.249
 location and several measures were taken in addition to that I use plant a program of

00:08:01.249 --> 00:08:06.800
 aid to small and medium-sized businesses was 32 billion owes another 10 million

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:13.639
 Now you could take out a loan, right? You paid interest as per year from

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:20.670
 SELIC two percent plus 1.75 low is a little above inflation

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.060
 and not so long ago there was no interest rate that you didn’t assume you didn’t

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.870
 mistake is seeing 14 percent of the error rate and it was gradually decreasing

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:32.430
 with seats in the economy was not using the pen as some have done in the past

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:37.380
 it's not like the police phone right I quickly ask friends from Manaus

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:42.900
 I have an acceptance on behalf of Manaus, it was very good to vote in the second round and

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:50.130
 I am interested, yes, I am interested in Brazil, in the elections of

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:54.450
 Manaus electing here our dear Colonel Menezes running for mayor,

00:08:54.450 --> 00:09:00.480
 number 51 a new important city is in the heart of the Amazon until

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.700
 I usually say, right, that the free zone is one of the great importance of the free zone

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:12.330
 we can say that the Amazon has Brazilian people there and that it guarantees

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:16.260
 right so let's say tell us that Amazon Wow otherwise we will have a

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.680
 present green desert that we don't want and it is a saint and riches in which

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:26.320
 ah it's true President and there are people from all over Brazil in these people

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:32.620
 here in São Paulo is from the south of the country, the center is south-central and the most important

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:37.149
 President here the Industrial Pole of Manaus with all that We structure

00:09:37.149 --> 00:09:43.029
 We also have a lot of interference in the economy here in the rest of the country because

00:09:43.029 --> 00:09:47.770
 the raw material that goes to the pole it comes exactly from that of the rest of the country the

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:55.020
 people who study more is Care in the Amazon says that we know

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:59.980
 approximately just five percent of the biodiversity wow so imagine the

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:08.370
 potential that the state has, rightly so, the capital Manaus to discover things that

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:14.830
 really only after discovery we will understand what we had there

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:19.540
 our exposure for a long time and our potential

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:24.080
 President in the bio is just know is fantastic and right now we

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.220
 we are there very close this part of the regularization there at CBA which is the

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:33.350
 biotechnology center of the Amazon that in our management it was reformatted and

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:38.210
 now for sure it will bring Good Fruits to our region of our country to do

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:42.830
 a little pout here about free electoral propaganda Look guys I'm

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:48.800
 receiving a lot but a lot of criticism because I’m not ignoring I’m ignoring

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:56.090
 is certain certain capitals certain city does not mean one thing are thousands of

00:10:56.090 --> 00:11:00.920
 people who supported me voluntarily are thousands of candidates for councilor of

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.880
 Zeus candidate for mayor has no way to do here gives a little strength everyone

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.530
 you would really like Manaus and participate with you in a rally of a

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:14.870
 motorcade of a walk I would like more I don't have several reasons the first

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:19.280
 that I would be abandoning here is the job that I have to take

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.620
 Avante wants to command Brazil must not have the resources to

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:30.150
 so it produces local the day has to have a guarana I saw is private right or

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.930
 commercial and also take a few dozen security eat I have not known

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:38.070
 so I'm discreetly here, giving strength to other candidates and

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.940
 those people are all you're not sorry I'm like a colleague now

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:47.130
 I even regret the way you addressed me in the capital of the Northeast that

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:52.650
 I'm stabbing in the back right-wing candidates in yours your

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:57.840
 the city doesn’t have conditions

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:01.470
 right in the buffer in the buffer than you imagine the support of the three you already more

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:06.360
 easy three get together and decide two give up happened if it makes more logical

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:12.330
 now I want you to choose how I have no way to choose I think I interfere there five

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:16.800
 percent maybe awake in a voice that's gonna be six percent four maybe i'm

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.680
 collaborating with some if I do an electoral program here G

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.490
 the whole will not have 100 people you my Live because it just takes patience

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:29.170
 then goes away in some capitals and a big city

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:34.450
 and is that I took sides asking for the understanding of other candidates not

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:39.430
 I have spoken his name so if it were possible I would say for example here

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:45.339
 Santa in love with the hand Santa pencil from Parnaíba Piauí As far as I don't know

00:12:45.339 --> 00:12:49.959
 there is a second round, it’s going to be reelected, I didn’t even need my strength

00:12:49.959 --> 00:12:54.910
 what more the way you treated me twice that i was there in there in

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:59.050
 Parnaíba could not have publicly demonstrated my sympathy my

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:05.500
 gratitude and my support for the heavy Mão Santa there in Parnaíba another person too

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:12.190
 that marked my life a lot here I was in bed 1992 when there was the episode

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:21.070
 Carandiru in São Paulo and then the whole press started to laugh right with

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:25.959
 up to 400 years in jail the military police in that operation in Carandiru

00:13:25.959 --> 00:13:29.180
 and we have an embargo here that was next to the Truth

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:33.470
 justice alongside the right people here in case she the military police

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:38.180
 of São Paulo and today our dear Sartori is running for mayor there in

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:43.160
 Santos and he already demonstrated back there that he is on the side of good against

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:47.030
 crime has the courage to make decisions

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:54.340
 I hope I ask here the people who have not yet decided there in Santos to return there in

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:59.470
 notary public 55 for the city hall

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:04.230
 we have Crivella from Rio de Janeiro who lives in Rio knows the

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:08.100
 his work and more than knowing the work with that the work of others

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:13.339
 are a candidate there so I have an affinity with Crivella

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:20.199
 already caught the next destroyed city hall that preceded it and the way in

00:14:20.199 --> 00:14:24.040
 as far as possible it tidied up criticism in the city hall We will always have the

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.399
 any candidate now we are not going to fight because of that I don't want

00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:32.709
 vote on the penis she has half a dozen more candidates there decision yours and and good luck

00:14:32.709 --> 00:14:36.820
 for your candidate, right? And whoever arrives who does a good job for the

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:40.510
 then the Crivella 10 in Rio de Janeiro

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:47.200
 and now here a person that I think is exceptional is a young man a boy with

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:52.990
 great future calls a boy who is almost old age is not younger my

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:56.500
 fine room Okay, and is a candidate for mayor there for Belo Horizonte

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:01.180
 Bruno engler so he knows we have a candidate there who is ahead

00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:07.780
 fired I will not criticize or praise it is the one who will have to do this since this is the pain

00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:12.370
 is Mayor is the resident of Belo Horizonte if you liked what he did for her

 convince the population you use arguments or your proposals your

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:03.920
 plans and more than that all showing your past you can glimpse a

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:07.130
 little bit that will be that person knowing her past I have

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:12.140
 sure that the same manages to pass for insurance, little is missing is

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:16.820
 we will have a good a good tie there the healthy democratic I hit on the occasion of

00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:21.860
 second round by Manaus city hall at least 51 good luck there

00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:27.699
 Hi, we have reached the end here. We have Celso Russomanno here in São

00:17:27.699 --> 00:17:35.450
 Paulo is very disputed there is the second wave is for the second round

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:41.640
 I hope that what Celso is able to get to the second round clears everything

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:46.770
 so we can see how the municipal elections in São Paulo look like is the

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:51.780
 city ​​São forma he is the third in the budget of Brazil So many think

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:57.660
 in it the other goals our thinking my Celso's is how well it goes

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:01.680
 administer the city the relationship he can have Central power as

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:06.360
 any mayor can also be not only is he not if the other cherry there can

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:10.800
 count on the same Good Will Our after all our obligation this

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:15.240
 our work but I want Celso to be a colleague in uniform, did you know that

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:23.220
 he Lieutenant of R2 she is a pilot but also then I'm in the crowd who's

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:27.680
 indecisive São Paulo if possible I ask to vote for Celso good week

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:34.010
 the last one here candidate for mayor we have more or less 5,700 City Hall of the

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:39.920
 Brazil in all of its locations there are people that I have shown themselves have made their voice heard in the

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:45.170
 Brazil and the right-wing collection São Paulo right-winged right to Ceará and

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:50.180
 Amazon right and that exists in Brazil all over So a lot of people helped me and

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:54.560
 unfortunately there is no way to help you all if I had the right party

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:58.610
 with me unfortunately it was not possible to stay on my part Lisa I don't have

 problems are up there campaigning just for our party no problem

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.280
 I have Captain Wagner here, captain of the Military Police, well known to

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.630
 population there in Fortaleza

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:17.390

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:21.590
 fight too he’s fine there but second round another fight so I’m in the measure of

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:25.160
 discreetly possible that I would like to be in Fortaleza doing

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.970
 campaign for him to also make a motorcade with rally a walk and not

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:34.910

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:53.240
 Fortaleza partly Ceará time to change and the name is the name that

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:57.170

 President in the surroundings of Barcelos over there on the Rio Negro Marcelo tourist potential

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:52.190
 Spectacular is something right now only with

00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:01.140

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:08.950
 region's natural resources have everything for tourism

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:13.630
 for your municipality or state but we should disclose that there we showed

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:17.170
 really what is the state of amazon and also the parcel turns off

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:20.580
 that and he knows Venice is in politics

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:27.720
 right, we have an election, she is single from Brazil, attends to the forfeiture of a slate

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:33.240
 complete of a councilwoman by a Senator advertising from Mato Grosso and

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:37.800
 now so you can see next to noon 15 also now sunday we will have elections

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:44.880
 for the Senate but Mato Grosso and our candidate here Colonel Fernanda has

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:50.100
 I said Colonel Fernando obviously military police is a woman is evangelical and

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:56.130
 is a person that I met a short time ago to have good information about her and

00:21:56.130 --> 00:22:00.210
 I I invited her to see the Senate candidate the truth I invited her she agreed

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:05.930
 accepted the challenge and has been working in the state it was too big I think

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:11.730
 territorial extension is Amazon she later I think it is Mato Grosso field

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:15.420
 I'm not mistaken, let's stop, let's go, right, it's one of the three biggest states

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.310
 of Brazil write its territory so very large including it

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:26.950
 And last month I was on the little plane there, a foot fell signal that she is in

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:31.770
 hard leather there so I ask you from the state of Mato Grosso If it is possible, right

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:37.180
 especially those undecided who return in Colonel Fernanda to the Senate always

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:41.320
 there are good candidates for the Senate there for Mato Grosso but my candidate is the

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:46.360
 lady who is a Fernanda has ours ok ok passing Campo Grande a hug one

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:51.180
 here you are in the class of 80 will go out looking for the sea Saraiva here in

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:57.680
 Campina Grande Paraíba Councilman 2525 from paradinha to

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:02.850
 and you know how I'm going to see my ministry, right

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:09.150
 choosing a sex life person ok today I said that the car wash was over and to

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:14.870
 I ended up hurrying opposition picks up and says what I ended up with the car wash is

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:20.430
 everything from another fact So for me until today the car wash didn’t have any work

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:26.580
 because we reap less by looking at their past lives also by looking at the cover of

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:31.200
 slow pedal And we also have one thing that I think all mayors

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:38.070
 could have Here we have one of the 23 - 1 is the head of the Aegean controllership-general

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:43.470
 of the Union He is always fishing the mysteries contract takes the contract

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:49.500
 Ministry such there has a hake which company here is what kind of bidding

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:56.100
 this material is compatible This price is compatible or not So what?

00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:59.310
 when I felt something always a light in the yellow and gives one more

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:02.860
 investigated felt that it’s weird so it’s better please

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:07.390
 And if it were not then, doing a good job of prevention, I believe that

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:11.710
 in the municipality of Manaus the same thing can be presented that you found

00:26:11.710 --> 00:26:17.110
 who can only be sure of that President is even we don’t care

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:23.860
 President with no party, right We are in an independent structure exactly

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:28.450
 so that we can have the opportunity to indicate and freedom

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:33.250
 EA Independence needed in the same way that it only made us dedicate our

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:37.990
 secretaries within exactly that criterion begin to cite the names of the

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:43.480
 boys don't know that you compare science with previous governments difference and

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:49.630
 Technology Marcos everyone makes an astronaut an exceptional person is

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:55.150
 dedicated you take another wisdom, you see that passing through the infrastructure just

00:26:55.150 --> 00:27:00.040
 engineering doesn’t get Ricardo Salles in the environment to people in the field is

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.840
 in love with him does serious work without Activate

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:07.760
 and this catch Tereza Cristina in agriculture at the beginning until your call

 the mayor has to govern the Campo Grande right the governor I say I

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:22.640
 Cristina would have all due respect to the Governor or mayor of Campo Grande is

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:28.520
 a person is sensational The agribusiness we are doing very well has already started to fall

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:32.630
 the price of personal rice saw me no one is complaining anymore I sent the

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:36.680
 my people, you know, get to the supermarket in Brasília, the price dropped a lot

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:41.720
 price of rice or soy has already started to fall is also when a rush

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:46.430
 too big so i talk here for you will be missing beans if i talk will

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:50.240

 he has a bag of rice molding at home because he bought it to make the stock and

00:27:54.170 --> 00:28:00.550
 now i can't eat everything here rice helped

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:08.309
 and helped her run out of rice on the shelf lacking price work rice

00:28:08.309 --> 00:28:14.580
 everyone is harmed rice we import with 60 thousand tons in the

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:20.400
 United States to help here I cut the flow here the account here oh don't say

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:32.309
 to end of stock So we have this in this is returning to normal here in

00:28:32.309 --> 00:28:36.510
 Brazil and every time it is only for the price Fábio who recognizes here it only always goes up

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:42.929
 obviously, the market doesn’t provide for that lack

00:28:42.929 --> 00:28:49.100
 producing more by planting more than the price returns to normal but in front

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:56.630
 the two candidates for councilor for São Paulo i'm in love with the streets i can

00:28:56.630 --> 00:29:01.520

 bringing the hotel radius the thousand km motor for sure because this

00:32:17.559 --> 00:32:23.440
 supplying energy even to Amapá, those who have potential have to turn it off

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:28.389
 very big right in a short time and the river is perennial so there is water

00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:34.480

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:45.970

00:38:00.309 --> 00:38:05.739
 speaks with the heart and the truth of the problems that we have and many I think

00:38:05.739 --> 00:38:09.039
 that I have the power to solve on my own don't often have depending on the

00:38:09.039 --> 00:38:14.950
 national congress the girlfriend of the times depends on the life of the prosecutor

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:19.450
 depends on the local population a lot to see depends on the indigenous community for

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:24.759
 resolve but we are always at the forefront not running away from our our

00:38:24.759 --> 00:38:29.289
