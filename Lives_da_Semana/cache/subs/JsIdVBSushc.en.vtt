00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:33.880

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.240
 75 years of marriage Okay, I have our feelings for João Pedro's family

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.300

 of those 25 thousand of the Spiritist sheet home of peace little by little alive so there is no

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:57.250

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.340
 story including you love that lasted 75 years passing by eye Street

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.660
 Pedro wants to talk a little bit about Caixa Federal and the aid

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:17.769
 emergency today Pedro we had in Juazeiro do Norte Ceará right we stopped there

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:23.590
 to make a Pick up a helicopter we went to Coremas where we go to see in the operation

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.390
 of a photovoltaic power plant

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:35.470
 so quite large complex is to meet the short term forecast EA

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:43.420
 would have 300,000 homes with solar energy and the total area after all ready you

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.230
 complex is equivalent to 1100 the football field in currency quite

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.950
 big is private investment just like Caldas Novas, right we had both

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.900
 weeks also just that each one has a particularity was within the is within

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:10.150
 the city has a human site and here we comment very unfortunately we are not

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.710
 in this research, it doesn’t make researchers live for another one, we have

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.820
 researchers in Brazil More specifically for this I believe it is

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.420
 heavy effort at Mackenzie University in São Paulo I don't know how

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.240
 that Mackenzie is on this project program here at the Super Drums here was

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.520
 everything opens now is niobium and graphene is a battery that will

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.910
 have a capacity to recharge a few minutes separate separate a post

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.920
 of fuel and the car in the socket will drink coffee

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.090
 drums and why that few minutes And how your composition of Oliveira

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.030
 Son allows you to inject faster

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.560
 faster Unlike the normal battery if you accelerate charge you end up

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.670
 having an overheating and and damaging the battery is going to be one i'm going to

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.260
 a revolution in the global auto industry today with all the

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.239
 sure the price of oil will start to fall Until at last Brazil is champion

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:20.030
 renewable energy is just a lot of criticism for critical Brazil that has knowledge

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.130
 critical right Brazil is the country that most preserves the environment approximately

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:32.300
 85 percent 80 85 percent of our energy consumed in Brazil is energy

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:39.770
 unlike the world that is in its 70s 80 percent more energy than

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.350
 fossil, right, in particular coal coal, so Brazil is to be congratulated on the

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.639
 this basically and it is enhanced what happens here

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:55.319
 in Brazil in a negative way because in our field we compete for the product in the field

00:04:55.319 --> 00:05:00.029
 nothing bro the whole world Brazil is the biggest producer is the biggest producer of

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:07.319
 let's not go there I will say that we are going to size Mato Grosso we are going

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:14.699

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:20.159
 corn is also the first soybean in Mato Grosso and the first cotton

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:37.109
 it was in amazon the second time i stop if i am not mistaken or maybe the third in the

00:05:37.109 --> 00:05:41.759
 Mato Grosso, right, but it is the great champion in the production of grains of meat food

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:49.270
 Ok so then tomorrow if not Yes I know you're just preparing a

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:55.660

 fast is passage there by the States has some Ceará and Paraíba Ceará and

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:16.420
 Paraíba Ok last week we had it here at the fiol in Barreiras right if it's a railroad

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:22.420
 West-East integration is part of this street on this railroad.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:28.360
 support of the Brazilian army the Brazilian army definitely helping

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.700
 collaborating in the implementation of Brazilian railways, I made an order

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:40.150
 during this year for me, the defense says the request, right, because there are no certain things

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.050
 you can't do it right You have to see if you have conditions answered no right because I

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.520
 I am the president I will reach Avenida Do this for

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:54.259
 the film requested for him here would study the possibility of increasing the

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:59.629
 I came to ask for Engineers at the military academy of Agulhas Negras

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:05.659
 so it was for now but there increased me three four five six the number of

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:11.150
 vacancies for Engineers in that military in Agulhas Negras is the people who once

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:16.849
 Sandy there goes to the railroad battalions battery construction hit and

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:21.750
 will help us to Coar infrastructure here in Brazil

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:28.590
 assisted her total 1,500 km connecting Ilhéus Ilhéus in Bahia to Figueirópolis

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.890
 Tocantins

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:37.430
 and how long ago Rodrigo Leitão Rocha came to know you spoke a long time ago

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:41.750
 of railroads in Brazil back there hear the option for highways that the price of

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:45.350
 oil was down there so it made up for that woman I’m

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:52.190
 aged 65 are more or less 55 56 years ago the price of gasoline was

00:07:52.190 --> 00:08:00.110
 insignificant then investment in that at that time if it was done it was more

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:05.660
 advantageous life to pass the time because after the C200 September oil crisis the

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:12.920
 sales that wasn’t that way but stopped investing is in this world

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.150
 in this world spinning quickly Pedro come on how's the payment for

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:22.040
 emergency aid is how the fifth installment plays wanted President today we

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:30.710
 we started the sixth installment for those from Bolsa Família 1.4 million people

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:36.510
 already received this installment we've already had the five

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:43.020
 installments not only for Bolsa Família but for over 30 million Brazilians and

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:47.910
 was the first batch approved in April and we have also finished the

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:53.130
 fourth installment for basically everyone else so we're president already

00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:59.670
 with approval of the extension of the aid and the schedule will be announced by the

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:03.990
 Ministry of Citizenship soon And then Caixa will detail but that is

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:09.540
 important President the sixth installment has started and has a very relevant data

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:21.800
 until today we are your government has transferred 197 billion reais and of these

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:29.940
 197 million 68 billion went to the Northeast and 21 to the North, that is

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:34.540
 almost almost good afternoon of the aid money me

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:41.350
 regency was for the two most needy regions the north northeast and the states

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:46.750
 of these help me there we approved is a Provisional Measure was approved by

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:56.080
 Parliament paying for three months r $ 600 for number here didn’t know it was so much

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:02.260
 reached 65 million of 67.2 for the work provided to land and has a lot of

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:09.280
 people who have a view to having a child have passed h1200 so there was an average of 2,800

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:14.380
 reais per average person doing these accounts, it was almost almost 50 billion

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:19.870
 for even just over a little over 50 billion for even some neighbors in the

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:25.870
 internet I follow a lot eh eh people's money is not people's day this

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.770
 individual that is going to account that everything like that you had no money in

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:32.150
 Banco do Brasil's cash at the Central Bank

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:39.890
 there are 50 billion there the hair of Caixa do Rubi from Banco do Brasil and it really is

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:44.960
 too heavy for us For Brazil, I know it’s money that isn’t much

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.590
 but it is also not negligible that I didn’t hear from anyone who gave up

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:54.170
 of the appeal so now we have extended a little over two months 5 months and

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:58.820
 now the moment of truth has come, I could not continue with $ 600 if I could even

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.990
 die for everyone here wonder no problem no Only that the

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:08.270
 consequence money in the market the will in relation to the basket eternalization

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:13.760
 basic he has a reasonable Malta just complains a lot there things are ok

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:19.280
 right, the rice really went up quite right, there is a super harvest of

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:25.160
 there for the end of this year beginning of next year we are also inventing

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.820
 import tax if I'm not mistaken with those thousand tons of rice

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.130
 that comes in the United States for us to see if the

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:37.170
 the price that we use to lower the price is using the law of supply and

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:43.500
 Search, do you think we should reduce the rice in the pen, right? Canal if you

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:49.680
 freeze or product goes off the shelf in Venezuela it's frozen there's nothing

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.750
 buy is the other country further south is coming with the same problem around right

00:11:54.750 --> 00:12:00.750
 This is really just freezing and this other country further south is more serious

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:07.140
 new government said next the businessman she is forbidden to send banned

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:13.950
 send it away writing there is no way not to go wrong, but I will also do it

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:18.990
 a lighthouse just a point to make it clear to the population that it is important as the

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:23.760
 you guided yourself because of the pandemic we unbalanced so only

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:30.060
 to be very rare when we started paying we made the deposit into account

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:35.140
 of digital prints and the days after that people can get the

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:41.260
 money so only President for a difference between when we deposit the

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:47.100
 money and people consume In their digital accounts and when the withdrawal is

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:54.310
 physical so what do i mean from this 197 and a half million are in fact the

00:12:54.310 --> 00:13:01.090
 around 250 billion so there's still a lot of money that has already been transferred

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:06.220
 that will be transferred but that has not yet reached the hands of the population so still

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:12.340
 for example, another 30 35 days and people will receive it and that in fact

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:17.710
 are not accounted for in that year 97 So it means that the impact for the

00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:22.570
 President economy it will still be felt when we say that already

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:27.160
 we pay the fifth installment the fourth installment does mean that people have not yet

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:32.150
 received some money in their pockets that not everyone with

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:39.470
 How to use your cell phone how can you talk, right, I had a paper problem Okay

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:47.090
 right to see the $ 200 bill so now the love house is printing more $ bill

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:51.260
 200 So we don't have a paper problem anymore

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:55.910
 so digitally paying imagination a race of people to

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:59.990
 bank right to withdraw the money to have the paper at home and we will have a

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:03.890
 Serious problem to have I was very happy that nothing leaked regarding this I

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:08.990
 I couldn’t enjoy a vacation Okay, do something and she would come down from

00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:14.450
 assemble another 50 billion a month really i think the total circulating currency

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:19.490
 it is not all this is not really even that it is ok then this one is over

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:25.100
 out of paper problem and I saw a lot of people commenting talking by the elbows

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:31.670
 the government’s intention was to collaborate with corruption, it would be up to

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:35.400
 more going to the shoe box has nothing to do

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:41.310
 old Even the note of all reais is a lot there, you guessed it, you didn't like the

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:45.990
 maned wolf But now it's ready for some time and it takes you almost a year to

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:49.860
 make a note of that so there was no Season had to use the maned wolf of

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:54.420
 200 reais right Record this I think a note was never issued so fast

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:58.260
 I remember that Roberto always said that, so it was a last success. Only

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:03.390
 no wall in the world has done that which Brazil has done and it is a great pride for

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:08.670
 back and then people must be complete a particular case I was accused a while

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:14.310
 ago by ex-minister Sérgio I live to interfere in the Federal Police this

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:21.120
 accusation of him right and even that at the time he that in that session Our

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:27.230
 reserved right Italy Pizzeria the evidence that interference in the land has

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:34.189
 unfortunately right This video was the homily Celso de Mello released

00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:38.119
 Unfortunately it was to disclose Only on our request that interest you

00:15:38.119 --> 00:15:43.639
 the Hubble process says everything 29 for lavender over there but the way I

00:15:43.639 --> 00:15:49.369
 talk and vent many times and nothing was found there now the investigation

00:15:49.369 --> 00:15:58.220
 continues and the rapporteur minister Celso de Mello is wanted me to testify is

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:03.199
 face-to-face answering questions are two lawyers from the hill and the

00:16:03.199 --> 00:16:07.399
 Sergio Moro himself affects the world has to ask anything to see he has to

00:16:07.399 --> 00:16:14.359
 be hours saw you your excellency right with you we got it right a while ago

00:16:14.359 --> 00:16:19.189
 interfered here did this did that Because it had a quick rebound

00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:23.200
 look 30 days before he left he gave

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:29.830
 an interview is saying that I had never interfered with the Federal Police but

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:35.410
 also then I appealed one day yesterday at around ten o'clock in the evening

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:41.560
 as Minister Celso de Mello is on sick leave Neilson Marco Aurélio

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:50.470
 gave an injunction today suspending everything from this investigation until my request right

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:56.290
 to be heard of in writing as has happened in the past with the president

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:59.500
 that preceded me was worth it too so you have to do it for everyone

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:04.720
 world right then the plenum of the supreme will decide I don't know how much is at hand

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:11.800
 now the minister fux lacks that and then God wants to bury you soon

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:19.880
 process there and put an end to this with this farce saw this former Minister of Justice

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:25.069
 and use it lightly the best he claims no testimony of him you are a wall

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:30.020
 who did not accuse me I brought the suit is a joke

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:35.560
 and it is now up to the Supreme Court to deepen the investigation or are you kidding me?

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:41.760
 this Sergio I live was all in and it will be that it is

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:49.170

 I even speak, right, the step is going very well despite the president, it's the same thing

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:17.940
 Flamengo was champion despite Jesus because he was the coach until there is tension

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:24.540

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:30.150
 understood will lose the game telling the certainty but that's okay And I didn't Yesterday I

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:34.470
 I said I live together I think it’s worth it for those who haven’t heard a little bit of 12

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:37.710
 minutes that I said are on my Facebook on mine Sometimes you are worth listening to

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:41.770
 what happened when we talked him and I said say

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:45.220
 G1 and everything I thought I had done

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:50.350
 everything that I had the opportunity and did not omit me I took a

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:55.840
 I talked about that decision I had about his vitamin I said that this story

00:18:55.840 --> 00:19:01.480
 stay at home, right, the TV economy, then it’s not like that, the bill is coming to everyone

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:06.610

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:11.230
 have the most days the kids without class are only missing

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:18.850

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:43.100
 almost all teachers in Brazil, right, is the staff

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:48.380
 the radical that for him is very good to stay at home for the reason it hurts first

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:54.230
 that for him I’m a Workers Union at home and another one, you know, collaborates so that now

00:19:54.230 --> 00:20:02.419

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:05.600
 Brazil present there only gives two information very fast which is very

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:12.830
 important is you helped revolutionized ended 37 and a half million

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:18.350
 of Brazilians was that they were invisible that was not in any kind

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:24.530
 of government program were found by the government of the five 37 and a half million

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:28.809
 of people that the person who survived the informality ship the satan and who

00:23:28.809 --> 00:23:33.320
 great part were not the first ones hit by that measure closes everything to

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:38.110
 I couldn’t sell the cat barbecue in the square, I didn’t sell the

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:43.080
 biscuit on the beach the soda there in the states

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:48.149
 and even wait for you there, wait for it to start there and even public the

00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:53.549
 football games here is not with its full capacity plus ten twenty

00:23:53.549 --> 00:23:57.990
 thirty percent before you can start opening Sergeant Tocantins I think the

00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:01.649
 people will see Anvisa's opinion of health for this everything is positive

00:24:01.649 --> 00:24:08.669
 walking in this direction here and the last number is 33 million Brazilians not

00:24:08.669 --> 00:24:13.529
 had with whom they go And why is this important President These people

00:24:13.529 --> 00:24:18.539
 when they needed to borrow money and one for a moneylender and take

00:24:18.539 --> 00:24:23.190
 Twenty percent a month and read to the loan shark there, the banks would charge

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:27.210
 average when we assume what to look out for in the past on Overdraft 14 by

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:32.279
 cent per month the cash is charging how much now 1.8 percent we are

00:24:32.279 --> 00:24:37.350
 studying reduce more is almost here believed 1.8 percent That's right

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:43.090
 rates that increase in the country there from the post the next of the first Mortal a little bit

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:48.790
 Ah ok because the distance but it was already acceptable the recommended you do not enter

00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:54.790
 on the overdraft already, if you want to enter, go to the cashier when

00:24:54.790 --> 00:25:04.650
 I cache Pedro the fourth couple if I already have three hello come on Question

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:09.600
 asks Pedro II

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.670
 and we have seen a sharp heating up in the housing market and the

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:19.840
 question to President Pedro Guimarães S this is also reflected

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:24.220
 the biggest one is for real estate financing at Caixa

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:31.210
 Economic she thank you very much for the question the box broke the record

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:39.160
 of the last five years in real estate credit in July in August September

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:45.550
 we are very well President we had a reduction in April and May and June

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:50.440
 we had already recovered Júlio was an August record also at Caixa

00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:56.410
 Federal Economy we’ve already felt a better economy for about three months and

00:25:56.410 --> 00:26:01.840
 we will have a very strong year plus one at Forte da Caixa the wire to use you know

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:06.530
 of that Caixa Econômica right now Pedro can talk

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:13.400
 and who are your directors, right, who are your vice presidents, didn’t have any

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:18.170
 political nomination is filling the past dear board of directors belongs to a party

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:22.730
 political group any other because another group also had this reflection

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:28.220
 or the gifts from Caixa were a guy who said stepping on eggs, right hoping for

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:31.820
 do not go wrong you better present it so you want one

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:36.980
 thanks to the president my boss Minister Paulo Guedes is just corroborating

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:42.200
 the president always spoke of restricted support I think the result is this

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:47.390
 the box has never had so much profit interest is low and governance index so

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:53.210
 good is the same thing Banco do Brasil Coincidência right That's how I do it and today

00:26:53.210 --> 00:27:01.190
 with the name of the city Down that old city there that you already passed here

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:08.840
 the ET woman uses Augusto Nunes on these trips, right? I just force A

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:14.030
 the bar is there I impose it right I have to go up there by helicopter

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:19.610
 let's choose a place to land so they can't often without

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:23.960
 all that security right but attention is my functional okay a blouse

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:29.570
 helicopter helicopter of the Brazilian army that that really are more

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:36.740
 rustic, right? And we can today in Mission Velha mission are old and

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:41.000
 it will be the Missão Velha Ceará so they land at the football stadium over there

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.170
 football field right the wonderful reception you can see the images of the

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:51.110
 ours on Facebook and there the staff asked to go to reactivate it the post of the Bank

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:57.410
 from Brazil and then you walk the box then in those 45 minutes I can already give a

00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:01.170
 news for you and for the Missão Velha people we will have

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:06.750
 mathematically, it is a post at Caixa Econômica Federal, even because this is a

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:10.470
 attribution of the box, right Learning everyone is a community that can be

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:15.240
 it is not profitable right but the social point of view president of Caixa o

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:21.590
 bank of all Brazilians so there is a social point and we will open

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:29.040
 a point there is a small agency but we will open mathematically so the

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:34.170
 people from in São old then old can charge me for the word I do I will

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:38.370
 I contacted the entire Banco do Brasil cashier Rubens Rubens to see if it is

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:43.770
 it is possible that it does not Force the bar does not wear it is possible for Banco Brasil to reopen that

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:48.930
 there in Missão Velha ok and Missão Velha Ok and he said he was going

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:54.150
 study and now you take advantage you don't know if there are any Caixa agencies

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:59.550
 it doesn’t have it but it’s a place that has social services

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:03.220
 with the box and the month is a region I will be there even

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:08.080
 President a month from a Mais Brasil cashier and it is very close to Juazeiro to vote

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:12.130
 in Juazeiro and then I will move to Missão Velha we will be received

00:29:12.130 --> 00:29:17.890
 as a lucky old television there simply Rubi is left to give

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:22.570
 answer if it goes Anything I take Ruben will also make Brasil Caixa the

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:28.530
 good Asked to get out of here now he asked 75 years because to take a break there

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:34.150
 recharged the batteries before coming a little to family etc. Rubi served

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:38.920
 very well we at Banco do Brasil here another question if he wants Zé Maria

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:41.280
 and

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:50.679
 and save a very good night President Jair bolsonaro good night Pedro Guimarães

00:29:50.679 --> 00:29:56.710
 Caixa president looks at Doctor Pedro show took action there against the market

00:29:56.710 --> 00:30:00.909
 financial market has been operating there for over 20 years in the financial market and

00:30:00.909 --> 00:30:06.580
 know that this is a great power right and the same taking these measures your

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:10.899
 ensured that Caixa Econômica Federal did not get in trouble until it made a profit

00:30:10.899 --> 00:30:15.970
 but my question is you really need to have three big banks still in the

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:22.090
 government the Banco do Brasil box and tmds thank you already got that one for me going

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:29.260
 let Pedro answer the answer after it certainly is for the boss of is

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:36.519
 the box never got so crazy we arrived last year with 21 billion

00:30:36.519 --> 00:30:42.340
 real crazy record profit and that year before the pandemic we were just fine and

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.840
 we will also have a very strong result

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:51.830
 What is possible to have both social service interest rate reduction and in

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:57.980
 true the core which is a consequence now this question your obviously the

00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:03.320
 president of Jamari I already said that Banco do Brasil and Caixa Econômica of my

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:09.320
 government is not considering his privatization as well as that he in the private of Casa da

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:14.570
 Currency there I just talk interfere exercise my right is no difference is a

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:21.500
 right my sign that you or the boys right in the case Paulo Guedes da

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:27.260
 Poça Elsa to the present state banks Okay The Mint I thought that

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:31.850
 it was not the case had information I had from other countries that privatized it

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:38.899
 and then go back I think that what the Casa da Moeda takes away It has to be

00:31:38.899 --> 00:31:43.220
 something like secret is blind not a national security thing

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:50.030
 the Mc passport the money coins among so many so many things there so in the

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:56.780
 my government will also be Faces 3 right the rest is not easy any

00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:00.919
 privatization is time-consuming does not justify the mainstream media saying that that I am

00:32:00.919 --> 00:32:05.570
 holding eating okay holding on like this Sensations there's a lot here that gives

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:09.110
 prejudice you have to privatize yourself until you give yourself free to someone until

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:13.159
 advantageous not only losing money, we're losing everyone now we too

00:32:13.159 --> 00:32:16.460
 we understand everything that the private sector can do that will give up

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:20.960
 say this our thought let's go like this

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:25.320
 good then Hi good night President bolsonaro Good

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:29.520
 President Pedro 'night with the pandemic the government was forced to mount and

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:33.720
 managed to set up a transfer payment program in a few weeks

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:38.490
 of income that was the emergency aid program and that includes the inclusive

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:43.380
 people who were outside the government's social registers, right, the so-called

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:48.600
 invisible now past that moment President Pedro what remains

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:54.330
 learning What were the biggest lessons the mistakes made the hits with

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:58.920
 that emergency aid program and what would you change or what could

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:03.240
 be improved o If there is a new government social program in the future

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:09.990
 thank you good night thank you very much in sleep sometimes easy right President were

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:15.420
 It was a very important moment in Brazil in the world and in my life I remember

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:21.179
 that the president she in the beginning is we pay 50 million people in two

00:33:21.179 --> 00:33:25.270
 weeks on the app's good morning we're going to

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:32.860
 we have three days of the law we find 42 million Brazilians is between

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:37.120
 people who ended up being approved and not approved but it's something that

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:41.790
 changed my life I wanted to thank the 36 thousand employees of Caixa

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:46.690
 President knows we have almost daily meetings that the President always

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:55.090
 asked us we had a very impacting disease and the question of lack

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:58.990
 money and President Minister Paulo Guedes asked Pedro how it is

00:33:58.990 --> 00:34:04.240
 going at the beginning was very complicated because everyone is in the

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:09.520
 agencies we had by But I believe this is what management is

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:16.960
 react to problems so in an objective way we had 67 million

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:22.610
 people getting it every month and many of them

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:28.150
 there are millions can't move on their cell phones, right? So, they are needy people

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:32.450
 several times the president even spoke on the cell phone people receiving

00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:37.190
 1200 sometimes 1800 when I had a dependent never had a visa so much

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:41.690
 money so i can tell you the following no country in the world has done this

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:50.570
 we have the largest digital bank base in the world with 120 million people eight

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:56.290
 out of every ten adults in Brazil has a digital account at Caixa Econômica Federal

00:34:56.290 --> 00:35:00.590
 this was done in a very intense way I want to thank the president

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:04.730
 and Minister Paulo Guedes and the cashiers, but I can tell you

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:09.740
 say this is a one click life experience continues today we

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:15.560
 we start the friday tomorrow i'm going to Maranhão on saturday we have one more

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:21.530
 payment and what Caixa Econômica does is every weekend we are in

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:25.830
 somewhere in Brazil the connection 72 weekend and in a while

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:28.830
 two weeks there is even an event with president I don’t know if we can talk

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:35.490
 no but they are very impactful things because it is exactly or with Carioca to have

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:39.630
 lived in São Paulo are two years in Brasilia together with president I

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:45.480
 never seen this poverty is that we see it in Brazil So just to finish the

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:51.270
 that is happening in aid when we take out 33 million people who

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:57.210
 had no water in it and we included 37 million people in the registry of the

00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:04.730
 government changed their lives or the pandemic is very serious really people

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:11.340
 passed away But there is still another point we changed the lives of more than 30 million

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:14.940
 of Brazilians because when we needed money they go more

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:19.680

 we killed by completing many works in Brazil and attention Our people more

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:22.620
 important besides the lack of resources is the

00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:26.730
 transposition of the São Francisco and began at the time of the empire If I'm not mistaken

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:31.320
 is this project, right? And what we want is this is a sign of respect for money

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:37.020
 of the taxpayer And what we really want to do is end this with this

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:44.820
 stock of works from the past I had these days here as coach Bittar do Acre
