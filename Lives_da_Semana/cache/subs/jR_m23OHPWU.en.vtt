 the moment of the accident at the time of the murder at the time of a persecution

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.269
 it has been an extraordinary role for the state to accompany the victim

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:47.100
 completely huge of assignments what in the past

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.720
 and he was even the Brazilian population there, people spoke badly about human rights in

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.910
 Brazil, you know, I used to say that inhumane is the right of healthy people to

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:03.000
 margin of law and that changed there from the camera mass length thank you very much for

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.280
 have accepted the challenge of speaking, you can't believe rape of a party

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.549
 child is the biggest violence in Brazil today

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.710
 registered is against children ours says that it is always identified that it receives

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.820
 all reports of violence in brazil and human rights violations

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.590
 first place is violence against children second place

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.580
 president is violence against elderly Brazil attention few will be of the

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.750
 violence against the elderly, but this government is giving priority to the agenda of the

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.220
 third place of violence against people with disabilities and when the

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:50.070
 people get to the child theme violence the biggest violence is the neglect a

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.170
 psychological physical violence and after sexual violence and then president has

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:01.160
 people saying that this pedophilia story is a small talk on the right

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:07.200
 they even said president that you and I are making up that there is

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.300
 pedophilia which is a new speech from the right read the report says that

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.700
 have pedofil the city in Brazil and I'm not

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.880
 making a thought that I slept president because I am the minister not

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:24.580
 I did this a long time ago, you know that, in fact, that was one of the

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.690
 reasons that the president brought to the government and violence against children

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.400
 sexual violence today we are facing a tragedy that is rape

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.020
 of newborns and when I speak newborn the president is a little baby

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:44.740
 8 days 7 days we have a 7 day baby study record in brazil and

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.150
 it broke out in the last five years it broke out and we're dealing with it is

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.860
 that and I have a very sad news president to give to you in that

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.310
 right now my national secretary for children's rights is at the event

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:04.000
 online to warn that in Brazil it is already possible to pay to watch the abuse and

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.690
 a child live online attention brazil we are facing chaos this

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:16.370
 it is not the intention of the right and that is hi and the federal police gave the error the

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.960
 ministry of justice and our ministry is going to confront the

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.850
 sexual violence in this online world and has been getting worse and worse president

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:34.770
 it is human rights, it is confrontation and child protection is

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:53.699
 and not even imagine it now but there was a website called linked to a minister

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:58.670
 do not speak her name please and he is very clear

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:06.210
 and the story is as follows if you and walking around saw someone abusing a

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:11.639
 child you must not take that angel neighborhood to a police station yes to

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:17.820
 the hospital in there should be submitted to the side as soon as even if he

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:25.500
 has suffered a disorder he must to the hospital wants to say something to

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.450
 speak the name here I don’t remember and I mean the following we don’t accept

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:34.320
 relativize everything I wanted in this government, pedophilia doesn’t relativize you don’t

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:39.810
 justification is not minimized and pedophilia is not explained if it faces no

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:43.919
 come up with this story to say and we’re going to put everything in the picture of illness

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:50.280
 we will not we will face as a crime and organized crime the president there

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:55.979
 an image of a baby in brazil being abused can force between 50 and 100 thousand

00:07:55.979 --> 00:08:01.140
 I mean that this is organized crime and we have to do it

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:07.690
 and secretly that they are millions of reais and in this child pornography industry

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:11.050

 all over the world I want to strive is soy president I want to export is meat is

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.730

 back to school program for people to try to identify violence

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:50.830

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:56.710
 and he is the director general of ms he told concurs days that we cannot choose

00:12:56.710 --> 00:13:02.290
 between lives economy is a false choice academy is an economy health alert

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:07.400
 they are separately there behind spoke right we have two problems right

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:15.500
 the issue of the virus and unemployment and treating both at the same time and

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:19.660
 with a lot of responsibility there came that little group, right?

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:25.280
 the economy recovers life doesn't know what i was saying recover more economy

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.360

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.160
 can we guarantee i had to see when the father a highway i'm mill and a half two

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.730
 hours highway complementing the ram the arrow at the road police station

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:43.460
 federal government not one of those I was here in the region of mines I talked to the head of

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:50.030
 prf post he said he had sent 131 to the boys on the track is run over

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:54.950
 but I ask them there that you are the one and then, right, she will deliver the ones from

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:59.720
 idea and then what is the root cause of this I have no way to prove but the

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.930
 the suicidal principle this is depression is the person who asks

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:09.449
 job at home the woman loses her job has children etc and enters whats

00:14:09.449 --> 00:14:15.749
 despair despair downhill right and ends up practicing the right suicide is more

00:14:15.749 --> 00:14:20.749
 one is also because I found today the French Prime Minister is this bra

00:14:20.749 --> 00:14:30.959
 with us she doesn't speak english nor french ok he says the following that she saw a

00:14:30.959 --> 00:14:49.690
 woman in the presidency the worst of all is that it is

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:55.630
 jean castex almost cost, right, the worst of all is that we are going to sink because we don’t

00:14:55.630 --> 00:15:00.540
 we are resuming activities in an economic and social crisis that

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:04.589
 it would be much more dangerous than the child everything is here has no ball

00:15:04.589 --> 00:15:09.000
 crystal you are a smart person a normal person there behind the word

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.570
 look hello be very careful I've suffered but not

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:16.320
 we can give a remedy such that the side effect is more harmful than

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:21.060
 alive himself and unfortunately we have this problem we have been in the news

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:28.589
 here son here was name of paulo guedes what economy is reacting to

00:15:28.589 --> 00:15:34.550
 Expect it to happen really, right, and we’re going to throw emergency aid

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:39.320
 by the end of the year I said last week 600 times is bad it's just hit and

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:45.080
 way will live that you and your reals is a lot for who pays is a lot for the father

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:49.250
 who pays is not me who pays the country and look here some lines this money is

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:53.600
 our no money is yours is indebtedness you will get the money

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.350
 in the borrowed bank the money is yours you feel like turning brazil is out

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:05.000
 division are also 50 billion per month of the image nothing I wanted 50 billion in hand

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:11.220
 in tarcísio he I think the bull of my hand of the year practically

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:18.090
 it would solve the big problems of the structure of brazil and the budget of the

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:24.240
 tarcísio this year that will now enter the forecast if eight billion already budget or

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:30.390
 eight billion reais for structure is giving 50 per month in debt is that

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:34.410
 the person who begins to see everything that is a place loses the rest of Brazil cannot

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:38.910
 miss the brief you don’t have to talk the economic link paulo guedes can’t

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:47.670
 keep the third real talk 200 is too little and too much and I say has sense is too little

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:52.410
 so booking is a lot for those who pay, so people of evil do not see them

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:59.130
 children also says that they are watching now augusto nunes and his

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:05.040
 colleagues he knows they make comments mind afterwards our program is healthy

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.689
 repair our fault like that and have to criticize

00:17:07.689 --> 00:17:12.519
 ah but it does with a lot of responsibility right so we can’t continue

00:17:12.519 --> 00:17:18.399
 doubting an idea between 200 and 600 reais by the end of the years that when it was

00:17:18.399 --> 00:17:23.529
 created is for three months this right there I spent the classic some want your more

00:17:23.529 --> 00:17:29.010
 four it's impossible to break brazil we lost confidence

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:35.000
 good and we have to notice the work but I don't want almost anyone for the money

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.210
 lost your job right so let's blame you I won't do it

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:44.940
 then you know everyone is aware of what happened that exaggerated it was

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:49.950
 beyond the limit, right, that politician who is very concerned about your life is right

00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:55.200
 there is the collection of wax work in life now I stopped to take a broth

00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:01.650
 cane there the government of the ratinho beach near it another one and mouth of the iguaçu he

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:07.460
 the people got there now but now the young man who was he saying that

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:13.380
 in desperate information here losing everything that is tourism region is right and the

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:20.940
 closes everything closes including jozu last year is closed restaurants

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.240
 road

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:30.150
 what 1,000 2,000 km taking food for the guga will he will feed like

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:35.290
 arriving this absurdity thinking that it leaves your world closed, the joseph says goodbye

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:40.000
 I'm leaving hem bye to say you lift me all responsibility how are you

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.580
 seeing we are now seeing how things there in your house have a survey here

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:50.920
 I will also say that they are right but talk about the states here you are

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:56.590
 to avoid controversy right the states that didn’t accept I don’t want and don’t ask

00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:01.450
 in return here in the pro federal government almost half of the states didn’t just ask

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:05.830
 the states more left right the governors it seems that some some

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:10.850
 were against me and solve another by whatsapp with that light

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:17.900
 if you want to give today or virus you are so what am I here at right away

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:23.300
 attention early life-saving treatment remembers that I went there in that small town

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:29.420
 in the interior of piauí going through brazil talking about early treatment is a solution we

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:34.850
 we could have prevented many deaths in brazil president warned us we warned is

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:40.220
 early treatment does not stay at home seek treatment immediately and

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:44.270
 look and anything calls there on dial 100 that we talk to you

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:50.570
 president many calls on the patient's complaint 100 dial-in is the right of the

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:55.460
 patient to treatment and we need to repeat here that this is human rights

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:59.540
 is why I get involved in this story is because I am the crazy minister not

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:04.160
 because the lack of human rights is mine and it is the patient's right to

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:09.170
 treatment and discuss it in the light of human rights and something else autonomy

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:12.779
 doctor in brazil we are going to have to discuss a lot about

00:20:12.779 --> 00:20:18.090
 that president human rights and average autonomy over there it is decided that

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:24.120
 going to be patient mini-skirt is the doctor cheered to hear us subject to

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:28.769
 simulate back in the guetta protocol even though the rope here we just

00:20:28.769 --> 00:20:34.289
 could be taught with the patient in serious condition I sent that word will

00:20:34.289 --> 00:20:40.320
 home with feeling short of breath from the to the hospital runs inside the go maybe

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:46.529
 could down the glue here give it to the guy say there are people here the doctors

00:20:46.529 --> 00:20:51.269
 here a meeting with time a little more cms your week here than when you

00:20:51.269 --> 00:20:55.470
 serious condition no longer has an effect there changed the side of my building the

00:20:55.470 --> 00:21:02.850
 presidency 200 and few servers and I also took the glass I don't know how

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:05.909
 this treat there I think so the knowledge that I have the great

00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:10.840
 most um treated I'm already here in the nobody went to the hospital

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:15.730
 and nobody went to anyone nobody was piped 200 and few people the most varied

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:21.460
 Flávio's ages now it's me plus ten ministers I also get gilson here

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:27.940
 got here da da is for you okay and even the business does not have the medicine as

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:34.110
 scientific proof then the doctor decides you take too long

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:39.070
 and the consequences the chance of death increases alarmingly

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:45.429
 and continuing here it’s more expensive than the plague, I’m not, I have lived for many years

00:21:45.429 --> 00:21:51.009
 northeast so i chose to be northeastern president sergipe a hug for my

00:21:51.009 --> 00:21:58.990
 sergipe state how beautiful wonderful he was calling the president let's see

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:11.019
 there a factory of a power plant, right, even the electric gas four times more

00:22:11.019 --> 00:22:17.320
 cheaper than that of diesel, right, for example in roraima and we are

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:23.350
 taking advantage of this gas that was often the conductor reinjected in the post of some

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:26.769
 day my google case is burned alive in the body a long time ago it is being burned the

00:22:26.769 --> 00:22:30.309
 gas that she produced now, now we use it there and gas is also coming

00:22:30.309 --> 00:22:37.059
 out right but see now that you can leave the party that provokes right there and

00:22:37.059 --> 00:22:41.080
 paraguaçu rio grande do norte and i wanted to talk to the people right

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:45.409
 people say that I'm abusing is my doctor is going to take trouble is mine just ok

00:22:45.409 --> 00:22:49.940
 it was mine there I like the people there with my knife during the part of my

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:52.970
 I was among the people also without any problem on my part and who

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:56.659
 visit my life it's me nobody has to guess my life here okay

00:22:56.659 --> 00:23:02.090
 in itaguaçu rio grande do norte curiosity i don't know here we are

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:06.349
 almost in brazil it spends almost 1 billion reais a year with the water tank and the

00:23:06.349 --> 00:23:11.269
 army I brought I am not mistaken 90 there in the late 90's was to stay

00:23:11.269 --> 00:23:16.460
 one or two years to 20 years the one taking care of these conditions we have a

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:21.559
 budget problem is lacking the water tanker feature we don’t

00:23:21.559 --> 00:23:28.700
 we want to spend two or three months without taking the water to these people who live

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:33.609
 there a nursery in the sertão there is more or less like then itaguaçu in azalea

00:23:33.609 --> 00:23:39.499
 we opened the well of the artesian well curiosity in that region of the farm 70

00:23:39.499 --> 00:23:44.000
 the family that lived there looks only at the person 70 families

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:51.440
 and it was a 45 kite car a month gives a kite car e-mail a day how much has a

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.430
 car that reality paternity owes beauty so 15 thousand liters of water per

00:23:55.430 --> 00:24:02.570
 day 15,000 is 15 water tanks, right 15kg used for 70 the youngest family you

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:07.960
 see your final wear bill for the final water of the month mine in the bar I

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:17.680
 the two children at home were on average 35 cubic meters so there was only one

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:24.010
 of those was already a month what 35 families were already also imagine how it is that

00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:32.799
 economy of going there so in this community 10 45 tankers per month for even

00:24:32.799 --> 00:24:37.539
 approximate cost of 12 thousand reias has to pay for that car broke down so we stayed

00:24:37.539 --> 00:24:42.100
 free of this community among others besides several wells being drilled per month

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:47.100
 here and also when you take this water of course there is more water in the community

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:51.960
 better people's health is and reminding the president that water human rights

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:56.559
 basic sanitation human rights and it is good to talk about it because

00:24:56.559 --> 00:25:00.269
 Now Brazil is aware of what human rights really are President

00:25:00.269 --> 00:25:05.470
 basic sanitation is human rights and the bolsonaro government is the

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:18.680
 right which is the government of the preservation of human rights i

 and there and there

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:36.190
 not everything that looks much more numerous

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:43.210
 it is what it is

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:51.480
 and I want to thank you for the question, it’s good to remember that no less than 10 percent of

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:55.950
 sexual violence against children is denounced so when I say that in

00:27:55.950 --> 00:28:01.680
 ministry has 88,000 cases of violence against children and 17,000

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:06.870
 is pedophilia multiply that by no less than 10 percent of cases are

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:13.230
 reportedly and unfortunately but 89 percent of student presidents is within

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:18.210
 home and what we have been asking for the whole society to help us

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:22.500
 denouncing we now deliver to brazil a channel for receiving

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:27.180
 complaint that runs until dial 100 and how are the people assumed the president

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:33.030
 they were 40 minutes on the line to talk now it's less than 20 seconds also for

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:38.880
 application through the website the complaint not only in the dial 100 as the police but we

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:43.480
 create a protective network neighboring vigilant teachers

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:49.600
 the educators vigilant everybody any sign that the child emits sign

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:54.550
 president the child emits a signal that something is wrong with him is resigns

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:58.750
 venuncia is the way for people who reach the child and our

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:03.640
 ministry offered in brazil the best channel for receiving complaints

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:08.710
 and I answer that way everyone says that without a call for us we will protect

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:14.730
 children in brazil the right is easy augusto really to treat

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:21.150
 of this subject in the clinic happens at home many times the woman there she is

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:29.730
 pressured, right, she is humiliated, violated too, and she has nowhere to run and

00:29:29.730 --> 00:29:34.770
 often ends up suffering doing ends silence enduring all his

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:41.910
 humiliation and does not denounce and afraid to go to her husband or partner to leave

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:48.240
 home is to be in need of bigger ones because there is no way to survive that

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:53.079
 asks if you use the letter

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:06.590
 and thank you chairman the amnesty committee is indeed flagship one is

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:11.750
 truth we go from the previous governments a disregard for the amnesties they

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:16.310
 announced a very small group and very high values ​​of their having an idea

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:19.160
 president there are more than 9 thousand applications that remained for his

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:24.470
 government for us to analyze how many elderly people died emily if

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:29.030
 including him the recognition of amnesty I have a request from 2002

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:33.830
 that I will still analyze the picture is serious and we have a lot to analyze but

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:37.970
 we are applying the law and we are being fair to each

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:42.530
 requirement i believe that one more goes a long time there to analyze all

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:48.020
 that the commission meets once a month there to use we have technical chambers groups

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:54.020
 but we have a huge number but justice is being served

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:59.460
 applied and we are also reviewing some indemnities which is an order

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:04.320
 ronaldo we are these fab cables in millionaire indemnities that were

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:09.899
 granted we are reviewing in this government now only from the ex-cables of the fab

00:31:09.899 --> 00:31:14.190
 but we have a lot to do yet the president of the most spoke that is

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:19.649
 fulfilled the law I know how these times were done does not speak even at the time of

00:31:19.649 --> 00:31:26.899
 en was in front of the presidency 10 to benefit

00:31:26.899 --> 00:31:32.539
 your friends who might already be there to ask for compensation that suffered some

00:31:32.539 --> 00:31:37.789
 thing we know this then no regime is perfect you don't fool me anymore have

00:31:37.789 --> 00:31:42.950
 about 40 thousand this year, brazil has a lot of knots since the more than 12 billion

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:47.539
 of reais in damages in brazil president of the sky if i am not mistaken the

00:31:47.539 --> 00:31:53.179
 38 thousand licensees to too many people abuse and how did she do the process the most

00:31:53.179 --> 00:31:58.729
 discharge the president has long been a very subjective judgment depends a lot

00:31:58.729 --> 00:32:03.169
 of the commission so when they are they thought they deserved they deserved when I say that

00:32:03.169 --> 00:32:06.469
 I'm applying the law is that the requirements have to go with proof

00:32:06.469 --> 00:32:11.749
 and then I'm applying the law because I want proof that there was persecution and that

00:32:11.749 --> 00:32:16.399
 the person deserves or not the recognition of advertised so we are applying

00:32:16.399 --> 00:32:20.960
 the law being together and too much our judgments are transparent the

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:25.129
 people can follow all ligaments and president and there in the middle

00:32:25.129 --> 00:32:29.190
 there are some public goods already in my hand the car of

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:35.820
 ex-president dilma is still with me also a request from ex-president squid and

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:40.979
 also from some authorities here who are still there asking them and but

00:32:40.979 --> 00:32:46.349
 let's analyze it is a too complex commission the president already had

00:32:46.349 --> 00:32:51.119
 finished this is met all the requirements but believes that still

00:32:51.119 --> 00:32:55.950
 today there are people applying for jobs today 2020 requiring some

00:32:55.950 --> 00:33:01.769
 thing from 1964 so people are very complex a lot of energy there but we

00:33:01.769 --> 00:33:07.139
 we are applying the law and whoever does not agree with my decision look in the

00:33:07.139 --> 00:33:10.799
 justice its recognition but there in our ministry the body is the perfect

00:33:10.799 --> 00:33:17.220
 and the justice being applied is not easy to rely on sometimes it is

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:50.590

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:59.539

 with his wife dilma rousseff with getting married back there

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:08.119

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:22.830
 dangerous from the fab he asked for compensation claiming that in the 60's who

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:27.750
 and little bet was chasing him when I caught his age that I

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:32.580
 I went back to the year of the concierge he was six years old so we

00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:38.460
 saw there was a lot that was a labor action and they were in the

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:44.010
 amnesty commission so there was a lot of misinterpretation there I didn’t

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:49.530
 know if it was a lawyer induced but i'm also granting him afterwards every

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:55.140
 thousand I channel sometimes one succeeds because it really proved that at that time

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:59.310
 has a chase at work and set up a political chase but

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:03.040
 labor action in labor justice right in my ministry not then the diet

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:11.610
 our a secret session there in bed

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:18.700

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.780
 personal testimony from araguaia combining

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:27.950
 and so it was to deal with these issues 38 thousand a left for the love of god

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:34.120

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:56.560
 i

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:06.980
 [Music] your story of buying the girl 10

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:12.700
 years and then the adult what hi hi

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:19.930
 and this possibility of abortion will not the bolsonaro government will not present

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:24.579
 no proposal to change current abortion legislation this is a matter for the

00:38:24.579 --> 00:38:29.020
 national congress national congress that decides what we're going to do over there

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:34.030
 especially in this case continue to follow and we protect this

00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:38.740
 girl in everything she needs and even know if she will be better

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:45.490
 with the family or somewhere else but we’re going to give this girl a follow-up

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:50.230
 until the end of the investigations and there are many answers in this case that we

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:56.349
 we are still looking for and so she is one of hundreds of girls with

00:38:56.349 --> 00:39:00.849
 less than 14 years pregnant in brazil president when we entered that

00:39:00.849 --> 00:39:06.839
 program to talk about early sex in Brazil we were criticized that it was

00:39:06.839 --> 00:39:11.770
 abstinence and that i was a religious i know what i'm talking about the

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:15.410
 children are the next sexual sooner and later

00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:20.809
 in this car it was abuse it was this double but we also have a great

00:39:20.809 --> 00:39:26.329
 motivation for the erotization of children in Brazil and we have to face the

00:39:26.329 --> 00:39:34.760
 disabling child in Brazil by saints here but about twenty

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:40.880
 percent of footsteps in brazil are children between 9 and 18 years old is

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:44.630
 more or less this happens more or less it’s very high we’ve even

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:48.829
 managed to reduce early pregnancy in brazil president from

00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:54.680
 from 15 years old to 19 years younger than 15 years old we can't reduce the pregnancy

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:58.670
 early in Brazil we were dancing very dumb why we are going to have to

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:04.700
 to be incisive in combating is to raise awareness about the risk of sex

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:09.260
 precocious that not only generates pregnancy president pregnancy is one of the

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:15.210
 consequences of early sex the pregnancy is but it has the simple president we

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:19.800
 we are in a very bad time classics in brazil and simple leaves the cells

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:26.640
 simple teenagers blinds attention daddy and mommy illnesses guys

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:30.210
 there are free sexually transmitted diseases so we

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:35.520
 need to talk to adults that early sex it’s not only pregnancy has

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:41.730
 other sequelae and also the emotional sequelae with a 12 year old girl if

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:45.630
 taken to sex earlier and earlier he’s old ah but they’re doing

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:51.270
 sex between them lie is adult with child and then it goes to the other side

00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:58.090
 which is a crime is pedophilia this is a complex issue in how

00:40:58.090 --> 00:41:04.300
 to deal with that, I said that it seems like care never enters, right, a child of 9 and

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:10.870
 18 years old has a lot of nine-story child girl here is grateful for what

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:14.920
 and I certainly don't know that yesterday I left more focused on one of

00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:19.750
 child is the city of servant the president is is the number is very large the

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:27.010
 all over Brazil the early pregnancy in Brazil that raped this girl that

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:34.000
 minor under 14 who has sex with a child with less

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.800
 from 14 even though she fair is rape I remember he switching to two is not

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:42.910
 exact wanted to decrease to and then president had the courage to

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:49.060
 present the written project 12 but behind the scenes attention brazil but advisor

00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:54.220
 will speak now backstage were talking 12 was on paper but let's

00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:59.980
 debate if it is not better to put 10 I sheep debate from the pt government if it was ok

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:15.210
 choosing 15 wasn’t behind and changes the penal code, I don’t know anymore

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:19.320
 thousand articles there and there in the middle I can't do that

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:25.440
 realities was 2012 and they had to approve by the end of 2012 remember

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:31.230
 because we, because in 2013 and even the Confederations Cup there, I could come to

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:36.600
 Brazil get the girl up there 12 years old legally and 2014 until the World Cup

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:41.970
 so I could legally get a boy and girl in Brazil if it weren't for some

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:45.960
 warriors in those backstage in president that we didn't have there

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:50.160
 called me crazy it's possible that he was in Brazil and had more

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:55.200
 I don’t know it wasn’t just the age of sex, it doesn’t clear if the case of prostitution was for

00:42:55.200 --> 00:43:00.960
 also legalize and there was an air in the paragraph closes if those that have

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:07.740
 boys and girls under twelve pear then over 12 run away so

00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:12.700
 a move on the proposal and that was there in the Senate

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:19.810
 still speak here in tse a minister proposed there to hunt a date a councilwoman

00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:25.240
 and from goiás good harsh abuse of religious power this

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:32.980
 councilwoman was an evangelical at the evangelical church event there at the service she asked

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:40.000
 asked asked and here the minister of tse asked her this land I'm already with him

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.340
 voted in favor, right, lost 6 to 6, two, but the personal return begins to

00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:49.570
 wear out more and more shoot at Christian

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:56.950
 the [ __ ], right? If you take the religion out of society, you hurt the

00:43:56.950 --> 00:44:01.330
 family eroding values ​​is easier for you to take power than a

00:44:01.330 --> 00:44:07.720
 society is a everybody fight with everybody you can be a great benefactor or

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:13.800
 you can do is a Democrat's up and you take on the

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:20.900
 power using the weapons of and then I didn’t support it for a long time

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:24.619
 after their conversion more actor marco feliciano now no i gave a

00:44:24.619 --> 00:44:29.660
 force that managed to stay with her for a while

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:33.890
 way that provoke low is not even then lost the power to start

00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:40.549
 entrance get there in their field and the story of the gay kit 'nothing against you only

00:44:40.549 --> 00:44:43.460
 for god's sake but from the moment he goes to school

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:49.190
 it got complicated it was late 2010 we are going to start appearing in this collection of

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:56.809
 family values ​​up to the key that they began to feel the weight, right, of tradition

00:44:56.809 --> 00:45:00.170
 of conservatism in brazil so this is what happened happened with my

00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:04.579
 collection nor are they having a miracle of the stab, you know, who managed to survive thanks to

00:45:04.579 --> 00:45:10.509
 god and then practically a miracle is also perfect just talk about fake news

00:45:10.509 --> 00:45:15.869
 I was slaughtered all the time by fascist or non-phobic already

00:45:15.869 --> 00:45:22.769
