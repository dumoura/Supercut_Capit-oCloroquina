 lost everything you don't have to do not lose anything and you take a lot of situation

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:04.939
 complicated so be it with your opinion since you think that brazil doesn’t

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:12.230
 supports more right on the part of some states is to have this blockade so

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.110
 big in commerce it's okay actually yes

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.680

 millions are not going to announce we have an exact but government measures have avoided

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.290
 here 7.2 million jobs were it not for the instinct of brazil so the government comes

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.370

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.280
 some solo yet right i want is thinking about economics not in life isn't it

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.930

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:34.720
 where we include in relation to money from activities essential to

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.979
 civil construction some of it is to be released other than the issue of

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.060
 industrial activity but makes it clear that it is not enough just to open it for

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.590
 industrial activity industrial master produces can put on the market begins to

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.710
 close there your part is full your deposits are full ok and having

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.930
 this problem at the end of my lack of consumption we also released gyms

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.490

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.860
 hurry a person without health not having a healthy life and also beauty salon and

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.120
 hairdresser some information governors who were not going to fulfill our

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:20.800
 decree I make one thing clear, right, we are all slaves to the law,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.190
 some government is against us secretly it has two ways picks up the deputy

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.780
 federal government showing the duda is in the state right and enter a secret project

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:35.260
 legislative act can make it not effective, our DMV is not seeing life as a subject

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:44.590
 or else let's go to justice okay go to court say justice that can there a

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:50.050
 authority of the judiciary to say that the decree is unconditional there to suspend the

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.740
 he did it we will resort this is the way it is just not I will not

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.900
 fulfilling this is not the attitude of a person who speaks and democracy speaks

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:04.540
 freedom and who is ahead of the ultimate account executive is I saw a

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.550
 a very firm position today during a videoconference that

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:15.130
 we did with a few hundred entrepreneurs from fiesp and ahead of us Paulo Skaf in the

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.620
 next if the south what the president has not decided if the

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.659
 brazil if whoever decides the governor and mayor then who should actually

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:29.680

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:36.550
 roraima which one are you how is the problem the city hall in pará is

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:41.050

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.460
 take this position and I greeted and at the end of the line with all due respect

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.389
 by the governors who have to decide are the mayors if it is not the president

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:05.020

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.039
 is the second largest state in brazil are connecting extension first to the amazonas

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:14.470
 the difference and again book the municipality until rio de janeiro say

 get pleasure from the city there at the base of the beach and the mountains aba difference

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.000
 huge so each case is a case it is also injected into account the amount

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.540
 of inhabitants of pick up a city that has no building is only at home already used

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:34.400
 quite large e-social doesn’t need all that money for you to contain

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:39.440
 the expansion of containing for a time that the wine will reach at least seventy per

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.910
 percent of the population this is a fact that nobody discusses now that way

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:50.960
 radical money provide one that’s hi I said that because there isn’t

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.550

 80 ok and it was difficult to get into the filter, they signed up for complexity and

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:49.620
 received, just that they were plotted outside themselves by meter and in our midst

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:55.620
 when the guy does something wrong, you know, the animal gets it, so they'll give it back and

00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:03.959

 talk more I will continue here it is a warm economic news that gives us

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:53.290
 worries and it’s not just in the savings bank that we try this problem

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:56.630
 in the morning i called pedro lima on an exam night there i went there

00:12:56.630 --> 00:13:00.380

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:05.630
 five million people are paid there to install their own house in the box

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:11.530
 sacramented by the good ruling class and you could negotiate the delay until

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:16.210
 two installments and you’re short of time decided to move to three you can’t

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:19.840
 avoid and it is not the press that the pedro guimarães savings bank will have to

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:24.720

 for asking now already approved four months of pause reminding only president that

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:28.850
 circular movement of the central bank generated by roberto campos allowed up to 6 months

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:34.340
 without changes in provisions so the box remains extremely history but

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:40.220
 is a help from the federal savings bank including in this real estate part a

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:45.950
 million and a half jobs were kept by the cashier's help in financing

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:51.560
 loan take advantage since you talked about roberto campos roberto

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:56.720
 fields grandson there I was educated with his grandmother ok it's an honor for me 91 to arrive

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:01.250
 in bed he they as deputy times is logically had no contact with him

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:07.010
 a bed has a lot of people, but there is a person there that a lot

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:12.649
 respected in bed and his grandson there now the president of the personal central bank

00:15:12.649 --> 00:15:15.709
 started to argue about saying that a provisional measure published on the day of

00:15:15.709 --> 00:15:20.750
 today you know that the scene is me i'm responsible called measure for aiming

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:26.930
 the legal protection some started to talk about it, you know, the mp for

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:31.550
 protecting possible fraud in the states has nothing to do with it

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:35.779
 he has to deal with the purchase of credit explain path with words quite

00:15:35.779 --> 00:15:39.560
 simple of course we even talked to roberto my friend more than

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:44.779
 20 years was in the region so what exactly is this provisional measure is

00:15:44.779 --> 00:15:52.640
 a simple thing exactly to help in this credit issue the central bank

00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:58.279
 with all the central banks in the world will be able to buy on credit only

00:15:58.279 --> 00:16:03.810
 that roberto bom central will buy without 1200 1300

00:16:03.810 --> 00:16:10.800
 it is once without this provisional measure if a credit the two hundred or three hundred thousand

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:06.699

00:17:06.699 --> 00:17:12.640
 entrepreneurship is that the economy does not stop working it has will be sectors

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:21.130
 of the economy is that it is quite complicated it is complicated to survive

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:26.320

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:04.610
 work because saving jobs and saving ahead is saving lives right

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:10.950
 well maybe it's the last subject right hydroxychloroquine protocol I

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:19.749
 I talked yesterday with the minister, the fish, right, fish, the Nelson raffle is

00:18:19.749 --> 00:18:26.590
 I told him that the federal medical council recommends the use of chloroquine

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:31.539
 from the first symptoms and our protocol of March 31 that still takes

00:18:31.539 --> 00:18:36.370
 the mandetta boys saying that claudina can only be used from

00:18:36.370 --> 00:18:42.279
 an element is in there in a serious condition well say there you have to tell me

00:18:42.279 --> 00:18:48.070
 I talk to a lot of doctors about how much the human being is in the

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:53.230
 serious situation with the snake, he hardly recovers it

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:58.509
 hardly now when it is in the initial stage, even older than the

00:18:58.509 --> 00:19:04.119
 the youngest person affected, his problem is hardly aggravated so the most

00:19:04.119 --> 00:19:10.450
 the elderly with the glue here, it’s not confirmed yet, but it looks like it’s working

00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:15.800
 right no i think tomorrow is the best to protect gives an answer to

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:19.850
 people I think it will be due to the change in the protocol I think it will be

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:23.360
 abusing protocol so that it can be applied then from the same

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.780
 symptoms especially for people more or less i want to leave the

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:33.170
 testimony my son my mother is 93 years old if the brother sees a sister speaks to

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:37.610
 the time was positive for her ok although my brothers already accompany me know what

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:41.870
 I think, right, we're going to go to Claudiana to find a doctor there who has

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:46.490
 very favorable doctor, you know, to see if it’s stirring and I got in there, I put it better

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:50.690
 also don't have to wait ok, logically my mom is quite old

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:54.950
 she saw yet another one with 50 for us we were fifty there okay

00:19:54.950 --> 00:20:00.390
 too ok well and the disclosure there everyone wants to know

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:08.740
 dissemination of video regulation of video is and those who believed that it is a

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:15.830
 checkmate is now screwed overpowering video you will fall off the horse

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:20.899
 good morning carol first i hope first moment that the video in full

00:20:20.899 --> 00:20:26.779
 is not released and has conditions is safe national and personal account is spoken

00:20:26.779 --> 00:20:30.289
 an economy is not the case updates now what she asks why does he

00:20:30.289 --> 00:20:37.429
 washed is that it costs a tie then takes a scene if it is destroyed when you see the

00:20:37.429 --> 00:20:45.529
 the ex-minister says that in the video it's very clear he was trying to interfere

00:20:45.529 --> 00:20:52.460
 on the front pf 20 minutes ok I could introduce it was not a second time only

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:56.120
 so I tried to think about disclosing I had already spoken here at the reception here

00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:01.669
 now that this place comes my request from the minister of the supreme federal court

00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:07.860
 celso de mello we delivered a video on the internet obviously the video is

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:16.440
 and he is this he is as secret is there secret is right the video has already been seen

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:21.960
 by the lawyers of the ex-minister he was also seen by the a g1 by the staff

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:27.890
 of the federal police and tomorrow the attorney general of the union will go there

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:33.030
 petition the rapporteur minister in the supreme court has the right to say the following, right

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:37.020
 are two 30-second sections with process interaction so no one has

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:41.750
 doubt about it but on my part I authorize to disclose every 20 minutes

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:47.040
 even to see in a context the rest we will fight I hope you

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:52.950
 here there is sensitivity a rapporteur who maranhão reserved ours has nothing

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:58.740
 is does not exist is not is filmed with a lot nor how is it in bed is like her the

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:03.240
 federal senate and expect that support that's it and spread the word I don't have

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:07.290
 expletive don't lie is my way of September one who doesn't want to hear

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:13.180
 swearing and does not warn to see and understand that it is a

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:19.150
 meeting preserved and it's the way we have to conduct the salary talk will see

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:24.460
 there that there are no words so it is federal superintendence that has there

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:28.420
 when security is lacking and that security is my life after the

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.700
 accident right better than attempted murder

00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:36.950
 and I always occupied but my family and some friends of mine what even

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:42.769

00:22:42.769 --> 00:22:48.889

 thirst of the plague but I never tried to process it did nothing even because it doesn’t have

00:23:06.919 --> 00:23:11.299
 how to interfere ok and even fake to have autonomy time should be scheduling

 before the preliminary injunction, I talked to dilma and handed it over to

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:46.050
