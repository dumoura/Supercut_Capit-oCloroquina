00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.830
and I wanted to say something since today it is said that I’m version I don’t

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.860
 I died but I was there on the edge of death

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:30.179
 on that sixth day of September 2018 the last moments that I realized that

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.630
 was happening

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:48.219
 and I was in the operating room of the holy judge house outside I saw that

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.289
 there were a lot of people on my white side

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:00.299
 given me moment the last words I heard was it is

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:10.840
 and we will open those words, maybe there was a doctor doctor borsato

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.540
 that I talk to him from time to time but I didn't ask him if he was the one

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:22.710
 said that i remember the next day if there is september seven and

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.600
 today i woke up was being placed inside the uti plane and inside the plane

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.300
 there is a person I'm 60 years old that I had no idea that she

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:46.310
 was later I learned that this person was a famous doctor, Dr. Macedo

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:56.250
 I'm sure that by god at the hands of these doctors and judge from outside and the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:06.110
 albert einstein hospital i went sunshine as well as for the prayers of millions of people

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:16.250
 who accompanied me in the week to come and I think we all have the sea is

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:25.650
 it's a story here on earth i believe that god did not leave a simple person

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:33.260
 like any other is like me go away in that

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:41.620
 day but the other miracle in my understanding happened I see here in front of me

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:50.200
 some who were politicians, I'm seeing brillet here in front of me on the screen

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:58.400
 it is and these people know what politics is like in brazil how it fed

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:07.139
 over decades and the profile to reach the presidency was not my nothing

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:17.969
 had to arrive if you want to have a party by March 2018 there was nothing left to

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:25.409
 tell it to come to the presidency as it was a norm of that

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:32.579
 time that this miracle happened even without leaving the hospital or after my

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:40.969
 home or many people to visit many evangelical catholic Christians

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:48.840
 among other denominations split taram and it happened at the end of october 2018 in

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.220
 election and what I confess I started to work

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:02.170
 four years before alone walking through brazil i had to pass me that

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:08.890
 really deserves a movie but I didn’t say it can’t be easy as

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:15.480
 for example my ticket to manacapuru monaco arriving alone

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:24.100
 in that city where some 200 people were waiting for me at the port and then I believe that a

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:32.440
 very important thing if you get the victory is john 8:32 always always

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:41.320
 bringing the truth to these people I never spoke to me to speak

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:48.100
 what the people wanted to hear and I always said what the people had to hear and has

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.230
 one more ticket also so as not to go out too much

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:56.110
 living a lot here how did brazil appear above all god above all

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:02.180
 Brazil above all is used in the military environment up to the length between the

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:08.510
 military and other he is Brazil above all for the first time the god above

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:14.980
 everyone you can search the internet every day of the event in front of the

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:21.580
 national congress I have several parliamentarians present this is 10 years old

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:29.260
 approximately and he jehovah multi-political leaderships that I was there and

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.570
 suddenly a pastor arrived who was not because he was not a politician and said, you know, only three will

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.520
 speak one is you pointed at me it was but i'm not evangelical are you going

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.580
 talk there didn’t use the word just a little while ago at the beginning of this one there and I

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.020
 I was thinking, what am I going to say? How am I going to direct to people from

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.690
 6 evangelicals say something wasn’t a candidate there at that time right

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:01.270
 I saw that I knew I was a candidate but nobody knew in my mouth, right?

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:09.640
 I had this piece to claim and addressed myself I spoke to this audience and with

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.330
 success that when I spoke and everyone I did not know how

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:20.449
 complementary I sent something that has me sent me to speak god above all

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:26.810
 you can be sure of that as well as the values ​​that we defend so

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:36.370
 worn out over the past few years and especially family members disrespect

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:45.080
 nailed tax against our children and the classroom the more and more wearing out

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:52.460
 institutions like the military are increasingly preaching discord the division

00:06:52.460 --> 00:07:01.520
 between us of race color sex this all of us spoke exactly the opposite as

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:08.660
 should be should keep brazil for us all 14 tension and i believe that this

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:16.640
 second miracle the election happened is because what was at stake was not a

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.690
 a government that could simply change something was a government that

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:26.780
 I had to change a lot and, who knows, I apologize if I'm wrong

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:33.180
 I can reformulate what we are going to talk about here now but I understand that there are

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:39.270
 something much more important than our own life is our freedom and

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:45.030
 saved walking and to be a venezuela as we have

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:51.870
 now there is a great danger ahead of us that we are already preparing to

00:07:51.870 --> 00:08:01.319
 away from it we cannot place the destiny of our country without a doubt that

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:07.380
 freedom will be maintained at any price I have an obligation the duty to

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:13.889
 awareness that you have to worry about it even knowing that you have against

00:08:13.889 --> 00:08:22.649
 us a huge media page to be found we still authorities that

00:08:22.649 --> 00:08:29.189
 work to make the country a country worse and worse than just this way

00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:36.000
 this can again ascended to power this responsibility is very large the

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.089
 weight is huge in my family everyone has suffered something even who

00:08:42.089 --> 00:08:46.160

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:53.819

 god and that the country with these people we could

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:31.480
 overcome this obstacle now see this virus is what I have been saying since the beginning

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:38.079
