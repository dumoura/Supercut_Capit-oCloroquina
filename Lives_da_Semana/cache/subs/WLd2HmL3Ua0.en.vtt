00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
there are specialized people we can't find out what happens right

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.650
 or this interference in the signal here from here from the palace of the dawn facebook

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.820
 of that, right, with them, some people, team analysis, we are not with us either

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.590
 something is happening isn't it supernatural not any difference is

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:29.079
 happening forever I'll be here look at the trial yesterday at the tse that is being

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:36.309
 judged in the action that was proposed by the pp by the cake by the marina aiming at

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.860
 integration of the bolsonaro mourão plate so in september 2018 there is a page there

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:50.710
 not had the bolsonaro women against bolsonaro there hackers entered there and would have

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.660
 the transformed the bolsonaro page into women with bolsonaro can against for

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:02.289
 As a result, these three parties went to court over the years to challenge the

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:08.920
 because when changing a page on the internet from contra bolsonaro to to

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.420
 bolsonaro interfered in the 57 million votes in the second round

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.869
 the joke is alright come on the tsf nation judge the rapporteur so it is that

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:27.229
 can gave for the filing of the I deserve to ask back asked for views to the

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.900
 process and presented his vote where he separated saying that

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.030
 and investigations should continue on who hacked the page

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.910
 that moment until the question we will assume that finding out if joão da silva

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.920
 here I have never seen in my life and has no connection with me and even if

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.690
 had it, right, because he decided to hack that business there is to challenge

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:01.020
 a plaque without comment also my judgment went on for another three minutes

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.780
 of ministers voted until minister alexandre moraes asked for views until that

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.510
 moment she 3 to 2 for the continuation of investigations to hold accountable

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.070
 who was the rack that broke it right that made the change this guy is a genius

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.920
 stay should be hired present at night goes to interfere elections take

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.200
 an entry renaming a page he changed the region 57 million

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.890
 voice for me and defeated hadade right we will apply for a visa

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.569
 ae're 3 blue then against the archiving and missing there being more

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:43.040
 come back and also the last one in that idea tie the vote there of the minister barroso

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.469
 the muddy to see if the investigations continue and make it clear as

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:57.319
 says there in the statements of the ministers is that the civil police of bahia is investigating the

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.590
 question of the search to identify here is the rake could not find so now

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.959
 if proceeding is being judged for the continuation of investigations the police

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.969
 federal government will enter the field to find out who was the one who hacked this

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:19.760
 miraculous page of women against bolsonaro turned to women with

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:28.069
 bolsonaro who decided the second elections is pt pt the network right there at that

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:34.760
 en psol bouza I’m just going to introduce myself I think now you’re going to say which one is

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.340
 that followed the phenomenon of the 2018 elections that is already being studied both in

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.050
 Brazil as well as abroad knows that one of the main characteristics

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.630
 and then it was precisely decentralization that you

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.000
 marketer there coordinating nothing you didn't have a team to say

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.650
 of great experts what you had was popular support for the belief

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.180
 popular was shown there in the most diverse ways people expressed

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.510
 on social media they expressed themselves on the streets and me creating new forms of

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.160
 support you right here in prison even if you were the supporter if I had done

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.220
 then, in this nonsense of entering the community in front, it doesn't change anything and

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.780
 even if it was your responsibility, it wouldn't be anyone's responsibility now

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.610
 if they think you just allocate like that 47 thousand I don’t know how many

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.020
 meters had in that community the vote for you, shouldn't you also

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.220
 to be responsible for the electoral polls that they attributed to millions of

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.120
 voters a position you said you would lose to any

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.460
 candidate in the second means that he would not go to him that

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.930
 is for anyone who was you did not study with me

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.280
 it really is matheus active there on the part of that party and wanting to decide with

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.530
 the captain I think we are worried but it doesn't fit

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:04.380
 prosper an action in that sense that does not exist we stay until that until doctor

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.720
 respect to the tse that has an obligation to investigate things but not understand this

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.220
 this collection is not even carried forward now those who voted

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.050
 the 3 to 2 who voted for continuity does not mean that if you find out there

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.220
 came back in front he cut it through the lap of the plate although I saw a

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.180
 I deserve to speak for the same saying that if you discover any connection in this haku

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:37.110
 even it would be liable to be annulled is there is a ship that left Bethlehem today

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:44.490
 stop towards the paranoia of that saw our our queen of damas gives this

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.910
 navy ship is full of basic food baskets until you get there

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:56.170
 and will pass in the city of afuá and nuada is this ship that the basic ones

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:01.300
 donated by carrefour and association of supermarkets in são paulo also has a

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.030
 sponsor economic box ship to box so as not to lose to other inss

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:13.180
 pays social benefits placing your from your stops up to the island of

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:18.970
 marajó so give it to a lot of people it’s a holiday there for our to give more she’s

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:29.000
 there on the ship sailing, you know, just obviously really sailing is to make a

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.320
 the social actions along the most needy files that had their problems

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:39.440
 aggravated is not only with the plant he denied screens having side effect of

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:47.510
 pandemic that brought you and income ignition jobs in the informal to

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.670
 decrease in industrial activity is also the closing of trade

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:58.250
 sponsored by the governors so it is logically there damares work is

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:03.629
 for retail for all of ours is different here I think it's worth it

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:09.090
 we mention that we have some and knowledge that goes against the grain

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.689
 that has been said by the press so we have seen for example organizations

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:17.069
 international companies such as the world bank, the cd recognizes the work that has been

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:22.159
 done by the federal government in the fight to the fore he has already been given to be released

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:28.530
 recently showing that brazil has invested in the fight against anemia and the relief

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:34.849
 also to the effects of isolation and everything else twice as many emerging countries

00:07:34.849 --> 00:07:40.650
 as Brazil itself and a value above the average of the advanced countries the

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:44.610
 emergence of the advanced countries that are there today is certain in the g20 will invest

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:49.620
 less than brazil as determined by you, it is also worth saying that it was

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:54.090
 recognition of a situation of public calamity already in January before

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.990
 even at the carnival what was the critical point there perhaps to contain the

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:02.470
 spread of the virus in the country and in addition to a number of other measures

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:07.330
 that who helped preserve jobs and mitigate the impacts of you says the

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:13.060
 disastrous measures taken by other authorities to take advantage of the program of the

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.419
 young dripping pan is accompanying us there I asked those my

00:08:16.419 --> 00:08:21.970
 facebook is blurry huh makes technique is facebook on things d2540 me when

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:25.960
 end our participation everything I ask you to tune in there on the radio

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:32.349
 young pan pingo nos is right for you to follow up to the comments that

00:08:32.349 --> 00:08:36.640
 will do after this passage we here also focus on brazil what

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:41.800
 want to channel the youtube channel focus on brazil also focus on brazil ok with 10

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:47.620
 thousand the street continues here in tokyo the actions of

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:53.800
 who the world health organization is a version that right all the time right

00:08:53.800 --> 00:09:01.389
 and to the left, right, it's fluctuating quite contradictory, it's already gone up

00:09:01.389 --> 00:09:07.870
 positions there is favorable isolation finding food favorable to

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:15.089
 marcia contrary to peluso mass was contrary to experiments for colatin

00:09:15.089 --> 00:09:20.889
 then favorable the differences to hydroxychloroquine and the penultimate of that

00:09:20.889 --> 00:09:25.500
 that you get the last one is the issue of transmission because of asymptomatic

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:31.149
 first said that asymptomatic people the chance to pass on to someone else is

00:09:31.149 --> 00:09:35.870
 almost zero a and then did not fail to admit but

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:43.160
 said the money there is the transmission who knows 0.012 so tomatoes are ok

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:49.040
 said that to confuse and it was not expensive right it was not clear to say until

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:55.390
 point that researches arrived ta the observations arrive simply almost

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:59.570
 transmission is impossible and after that transmission is possible and if

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:05.000
 possible it can be every one million not to transmit it escapes ok but it is the ms not

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:12.260
 understand lost credibility the trump price came out of ms million thing we

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:17.180
 we bought united states was the largest resident laboratory withdrew from

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:22.310
 placement asked for an investigation even we have a group of

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:25.850
 countries that brazil is part of well requesting an investigation

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:31.100
 regardless of driving could be on the part of the oms which is important to remember

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:36.120
 that also kept with money the Brazilian much smaller but that comes

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.390
 doing all this confusion all this president thing of the people

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:43.200
 asymptomatic is a lot of people here in brazil i'm saying i said

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.250
 coastal the ms speech was not what happened that look he will see clear

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:52.980
 she saying we have received data from a number of countries that track the

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:57.860
 asymptomatic people her contact with other people some can

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:02.220
 we found that the transmission of these cases is very rare, practically

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:06.990
 inexistent that who said was the head of the technical team to combat

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:11.310
 coronavirus inside the ussr after they saw that that didn’t get right here in

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.880
 case there with a political approach that they had given came to speak but there is no

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.100
 how to know who is asymptomatic and who is pre-symptomatic but these studies cited

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:25.460
 she made this differentiation and now shows a person

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:29.580
 asymptomatic after so many days ok, you can have contact and the load

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.380
 viral is very low and will not have any risk

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:38.710
 and if you have a case here for example the man is infected he is like this taking his

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:45.010
 wife the kids no i get this despite sleeping in the same double bed want to see

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:49.930
 television was at home to see you don't let me have the one in front of me

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:55.240
 here is a plague goat here mozart the money on the internet recently promoted

00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:04.240
 missing a polite presence here, he came from sergeant he got infected he found no

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:16.060
 Yes, I’m almost at the end, I was worried because there was little time and at home

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.830
 and it is the typical case of so tomato quina a

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:25.520
 wife and children they didn’t take it because it’s like taking it only if someone else

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:31.110
 it wasn’t asymptomatic that the ends of the yarns and for example have some

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:36.540
 contact, right, your family, it's worth it, of course, here on the side of the whole

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:47.730
 world will be fashion barn farm in ceará the square and explanations on rear data

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:52.320
 so it started at Globo TV Globo always enhances anything that

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:59.510
 we are the television space that has nothing to talk about everything is against but

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:05.160
 the data started to be presented later but every day didn’t serve to

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:18.900
 making the national newspaper is not what to do soon after is explained no

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:25.620
 it was only at that meeting of ministers that there was the last one our tuesdays has

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:30.600
 as on the same day he was wanted by the deputy there in bed the is potassium and if

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:35.550
 it came out very well explaining there I say why it changed not the methodology anymore

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:39.540
 changed anything for help if it was clearer you have to say almost

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:44.670
 died that day ok and my wife that load of works that came from days

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:48.630
 ok I have to be diluted in the previous days you public on the side

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:52.770
 getting there is also too much information x people who lost their lives

00:13:52.770 --> 00:14:01.349
 unfortunately because of the hi virus it's very clear used in real time will

00:14:01.349 --> 00:14:06.089
 arriving already putting it there until it completes the last unit of the federation must be ok

00:14:06.089 --> 00:14:11.219
 closed the painting you want there and announcing it while the

00:14:11.219 --> 00:14:15.809
 data for your nothing again is that we want to hide numbers from

00:14:15.809 --> 00:14:21.719
 started comparing us with venezuela thanks tv compare with venezuela with korea

00:14:21.719 --> 00:14:27.359
 from the north is that the other country over there is communist and she said that responding

00:14:27.359 --> 00:14:31.409
 nobody that this hair has no problem it is not that it regrets it is not we take

00:14:31.409 --> 00:14:37.950
 dying 10 weeks right it will be a thousand bills saw there now will remember

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:44.280
 what we are investigating is that there is a lot of data that arrives, right, population

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:51.030
 complains that the person practically a series of health problems are in

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:56.340
 death so far family god is alive had not contracted the virus and

00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:04.110
 appears at death as an invitation 19 this is not a person the case are dozens of

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:10.230
 cattle per day I arrive in that sense I don’t know what happens, you know what they want

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:14.850
 to win with that, okay, I come from the guys, you can only go out just enjoying it

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:20.040
 then the people who die for your power for that and are blaming the federal government

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:26.360
 look there is no way to prevent this disease this is the other what actually happens

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:32.070
 those who contracted the virus have dampness which is old age are

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:37.960
 weaker people the possibility of entering as soon as it is very large and

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:43.480
 the federal government is able to do to contain everything that from the beginning and

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:48.790
 the flattening of the curve was talking about here, the isolation had to happen

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:57.580
 so that if people looked in hospitals here that have lotteries and

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:02.020
 also the respirators the information that we have may be misleading

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:06.209
 but in full big step right no one

00:16:06.209 --> 00:16:10.889
 lost his life with loose leaves vacuum cleaner the reader may have happened

00:16:10.889 --> 00:16:14.550
 at home another one more including the information arrives for us

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:19.410
 the field hospital hen near you has a public hospital right ah

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:23.279
 sora valeu has filming a lot of people doing it is more people have to do

00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:28.980
 to show if the milks are busy or not right if the expenses are compatible

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:34.290
 or it doesn’t give everything that comes to me on social networks in this d'ajuda we do

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:41.400
 a filter and forward it to and say federal police or for me I’ve seen

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:45.360
 there he did what to do with the data so it's close I can't take ricardo who

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:50.070
 arrives not knowledge I step forward it has to be for intelligence

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:55.290
 of them analyzed and opened the investigative process whether or not we want

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:59.820
 this story is true now you are good that you can see got to the city of

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:05.880
 you see there is respiratory failure heart disease now I don't know what is that the

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:13.080
 video comes in as just invite no people who die with the invitation the alleys

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:18.360
 video I know it's hard for you to part ways out never machine we don't want

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:22.290
 are numbers that do not match you with seeing have to do with the truth

00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:28.020
 and then you don’t need about this narrative that they tried to force that there was the

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.380
 guests try first that you want possible because everything that the

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:36.960
 the federal government does is update the data, that is, it has no sources

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:41.670
 alternatives of the data evidently does not compare to north korea any

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:46.350
 this nonsense what steals it was a mechanical technical error has already been fixed

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:51.030
 the data are made available and that it was born precisely from this process of

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:56.070
 programmatic data correction the minimum just jokes explained above also

00:17:56.070 --> 00:18:01.530
 I believe in his latest press conferences but basically selling this issue made us

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:06.630
 a confusion there between the deaths actually occurred in the last 24

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:11.220
 hours with lots totaled so according to choose to differentiate a thing from

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:16.020
 another also review the wrong data as you spoke and show to the

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.470
 population that many of these data need to be demystified and how the

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:25.420
 people like to quote the ms the pro the ps has a tip there that the data accuracy

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:29.140
 selection of more detailed cases we need to understand which ones have as

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.680
 skills which do not have which communities are these that didn’t come

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:36.340
 being done with from the determination of the lord I'm sure that we will

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:41.710
 have much more accurate data now and that go from there to health professionals to

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:45.970
 ability to understand and in the morning of a land thing we will raise it to

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:52.810
 population in a thoughtful way over there state same são paulo that made forward look

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:57.340
 and give everything closed until my eldorado paulista right old you don't have more than

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:03.860
 three thousand inhabitants to a quarter there for the video is one of

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:07.970
 inhabitants is much bigger than Minas Gerais present, but that didn’t leave

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:14.450
 much less so if the accommodation closes it is less deaths this store that is

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:18.200
 the numbers were inflated on the one hand, right

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.530
 and I'm not very much in need of anything else that's going on and

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:26.740
 old certificates and the question of where does the participation of the federal government come in

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:31.820
 to decrease the number of mother-in-law optics on social networks, special cardiac right

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:37.580
 of banana we go on the street profile of him half who is there behind 13 of the book

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:42.710
 all these things so it is logically there already know if the person is going to talk

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:48.179
 always [ __ ] there because the main thing to enjoy a little less is to

00:19:48.179 --> 00:19:54.600
 believe not to miss getting culture much smaller than the mass there but those numbers

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:59.730
 has to be as close to the child's reality as it is real for you to do the

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:03.870
 calculating the region of campinas jundiaí presents you have to know that it's

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:07.890
 something abnormal happening that you are doing there I say that you are doing it in sentences or not

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:12.809
 it is only necessary a sub notification has to know which case of the convention form in the

00:20:12.809 --> 00:20:17.520
 face I will not speak at least do not have that he was little time in the ministry

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:23.180
 that starts but taking into account the previous minister these numbers there is not

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:32.570
 and he was selling fish every day and he stays at home.

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:40.270
 kneading science focus but I don’t look at this one

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:46.460
 like the one-handed person, okay, but there, there is a slip of the

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:52.790
 collection of a sword pandemic then he was excited by the globe, you know that

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:55.610
 he was the customer of the globe liked liked the intelligence paid nothing

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:59.570
 staff against him for sure in other areas worked very well good luck

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:04.490
 a few more letters is there was some exaggeration by the lust of those numbers

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:08.900
 that time because the goal was to sell the dread right and nowadays

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:12.950
 talking each one will do it a little while now she is isolated from belém to the island

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:19.100
 from marajó she sees rapporteur is the last journey the beginning i'm already personally to

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:23.160
 me also the increase in domestic violence increase in

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:30.360
 I’m going to go from child abuse to depression problems, an explosion in

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:34.890
 number of divorces and I go from yours also to the jacket a couple forever

00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:39.840
 right I married him twice the one who was arrested with two times you wait in

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:44.730
 no couple arrives ok it's gotta work it out i'm already i tried a

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:50.040
 two until fair already the fault of the man or woman who separate or have already paid

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:54.810
 you still don't need to answer the delegate the way to be objective you get married is because it is

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:59.430
 happy and you want to get married I will see why you said you have to get married to be

00:21:59.430 --> 00:22:27.880
 even more in the boy who ran a minor there was

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:35.260
 true I don’t even know about business is married two children very happy and happy or

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:47.360
 unhappy a difference the wrong you are and then

00:22:47.360 --> 00:23:12.460
 and if you are married thanks and you happy very kitchen room and

00:23:12.669 --> 00:23:19.149
 hi all right look just look at this excitement is awareness when we

00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:22.749
 to say that if we look at a really scientific attitude towards

00:23:22.749 --> 00:23:27.970
 throughout history we can see that the quarantine of

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:33.369
 sick people is even in old books with the bible itself we

00:23:33.369 --> 00:23:37.690
 takes in numbers the procedure of quarantining people with letter by

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:41.289
 example in other sources of ancient religions we will find this now

00:23:41.289 --> 00:23:45.999
 the total quarantine of society had never been practiced as proposed in that

00:23:45.999 --> 00:23:50.409
 Our science comes to science instead of science it never seeks something that

00:23:50.409 --> 00:23:57.850
 has not been tested and whose calculation was not you can see you talking to the

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:01.029
 others that I talk about right common sense of I am sure you have to I

00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:05.080
 press boot give an always final beauty tomorrow on saturday gave a way out

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.960
 with the press on my side of the front visit here look

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:13.880
 in some cities the skin that will no longer be humble go and get into the house

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:18.140
 of people and ask how is life not leaving us open we will

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:22.730
 choose with the street thing I chose to show everything guy saying is like

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:27.350
 you have reported here in my house under the husband only my son had anyone

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:32.210
 more to see you and now of proven cream on about

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:36.210
 coronavirus so everything you talk about now is this

00:24:36.210 --> 00:24:43.230
 and from time to time someone still has a break, right? I can't use the

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:47.610
 hydroxychloroquine that has not been scientifically proven has not gone green

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:55.140
 medicine is this if a is a pill is not blue from anitta anitta anitta anitta you have

00:24:55.140 --> 00:25:01.700
 people asking for a strength in our minister of science and technology is has

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:08.179
 the state this is an anvisa protocol and some hospitals and it has given results

00:25:08.179 --> 00:25:15.130
 also i think it even hurts better than the curtain because it removed it killed her game and and

00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:20.779
 fighting the expansion of the river has only worked now, chloroquine is the

00:25:20.779 --> 00:25:24.399
 favorite medicine of famous doctors, we get it from my secretary

00:25:24.399 --> 00:25:31.220
 health secretary of são paulo rio de janeiro not for him so i'm only at the dr

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:36.200
 carlinho said i'm stupid right david with fall who is the team's doctor

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:41.870
 dollar crowns but didn’t say he could speak it wasn’t hydroxy

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:47.660
 I would be lying you don't say it here now it was doc would be fired now

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:53.770
 more recently leaked the recipe that we two letters he stays on the street here

00:25:53.770 --> 00:26:01.430
 it's not cheap, right, the people stay at home, stay at home, right, and another one in the protocol of

00:26:01.430 --> 00:26:05.630
 Ministry of Health and said that I could only use this one in serious cases

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:09.890
 and then you take a snakebite you’ll take it we’ll give it a little more time

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:17.240
 here to see if the venom's effects are not that severe you have to

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:21.710
 take right at the beginning so let's go the same in relation to comes nothing proven sense

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:26.030
 that we worked now has been in Brazil that the prohibition of

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:31.940
 hydroxychloroquine is a few senators from the pt filed a petition in tcu

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:38.120
 to render that recommendation of the Ministry of Health ineffective in

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:43.510
 regarding the use of hydroxyproline, if it had entered there

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:47.800
 o and showing you another alternative you could even think about it now whoever wants

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:52.880
 of those who do not want to take the pill that I do not change s

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:59.340
 I'm not even going to talk about Brazil, say capitu, my mother is 93 years old

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:06.450
 there are family members there and the doctor from the city she is here is

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:12.240
 There are several cities, right? She’s there in Paracatu, upsetting about the big Cajati and the

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:17.760
 gilt is in the brother's house but is more stopped in the municipality at the moment if

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:23.490
 has to start to reach, right, she will have prescribed it by a doctor to take

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:28.830
 enough it was not no I will not wait for my 93-year-old mother to get worse

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:33.299
 a situation because I'm not sure here but it must be weighing about 40 and

00:27:33.299 --> 00:27:38.850
 pretty skinny sure my mom has some health problems let me record

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:45.299
 to open myself so that the work is that hunger there, drugs will take right and

00:27:45.299 --> 00:27:50.490
 family adhesion

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:54.929
 green for my mom to take delivery until president donald trump his mouth me

00:27:54.929 --> 00:28:00.330
 reported to the press and she also asked you to pick up your phone using the

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:04.930
 preventive preventive prof today I didn't take anything not if I already I

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:11.710
 I think it has already been contacted what is given the way that an airplane turns to do in

00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:22.530
 states in the role of 23 was not there and I called there too I will also leave

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:32.679
 is hello alright but within that

00:28:32.679 --> 00:28:37.380
 report from the bandeirantes that explains exactly how uber hello

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:43.630
 continuing here ministry of communications and communications takes

00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:48.640
 communication of the presidency of the republic program he sure catch the

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:54.490
 boy from science and technology another part of the government scar more sources

00:28:54.490 --> 00:29:00.519
 and there was a part of it already hamas and another part there was no increase of 1009

00:29:00.519 --> 00:29:06.039
 not even a post was created heaven is my channel to talk ah but created the post of

00:29:06.039 --> 00:29:12.840
 the minimum wage would also be made by Fábio, he was already appointed Minister of Communications

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:18.279
 he if he can choose to receive a deputy's salary gives him up

00:29:18.279 --> 00:29:24.590
 home eats risk so the cost is no increase in costs

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:30.230
 the intention is obviously go dry go there then be there you go right

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:34.760
 try to improve government communications but the great job of this

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:39.080
 ministry is is the communications that I am not in Brazil we have ahead of

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:44.470
 collection of the 5g we already know the egg monita are mine

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:50.230
 that talks about interference, right, my guidance and buying the cd is in these

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:55.990
 and in this collection and we can be sure we will make the best deal taking into account

00:29:55.990 --> 00:30:00.940
 account several aspects not only the economic sometimes the cheapest not

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:06.280
 I mean it is the best right and not always the most expensive can be better

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:11.920
 we too will meet the requirements of national sovereignty for the security of

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:19.390
 information in data security and also our our our policy

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:23.020
 external part also comes into this question something from the daughter I presented this

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:27.520
 even if there is a lot of talk in the 5g press, but from the beginning, you determined

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.990
 that it was national criteria that took into account economics it took

00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:36.520
 evidently taking into account the communications area in brazil the need for

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:40.940
 new technologies plus also national security the security

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:46.370
 the privacy of the people who surf the networks there and the freedom of those

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:51.380
 can use social networks and now the flags most dear to you since the

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:57.290
 time that the current with parliamentary look when it was voted and approved the landmark

00:30:57.290 --> 00:31:02.620
 internet civilian got it, i did what i could otherwise but the vaco climax none

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:09.440
 I have to be free, I doubt anyone since before I was president, I picked up more

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:13.130
 social networks than I am during my pre-campaign and time campaign

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:21.010
 all of them films call me a racist misogynist of not liking northeasterners is

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:26.420
 easy to imagine everything right you even saw the campaign video among others from pt

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:31.640
 during the campaign that glass intentions a minute a girl appeared

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:37.580
 maybe 20 years old, right, with the swastika mark on the belly, it's not scoring there

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:46.279
 sleep there the pt did campaigns imagine the tattoo

00:31:46.279 --> 00:31:56.809
 and the gillette on the body of the great thing, well afterwards it was seen that according to the expertise

00:31:56.809 --> 00:32:03.919
 that she only finds really marked with razor, right, a blade was she

00:32:03.919 --> 00:32:08.239
 did to her with a third party with her consent that on the day of a

00:32:08.239 --> 00:32:13.129
 mark a little bit deeper if you are going to make angry at hard a

00:32:13.129 --> 00:32:18.950
 swastika, right, it wasn’t that person at that time, you would need no more

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:24.289
 it would happen here the pt used it widely against them the difficult the pt

00:32:24.289 --> 00:32:29.450
 say your dreams that I would end the ox end the Bolsa Família but this

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:34.729
 delicacy can can if it can't be yours from the Bolsa Família okay I'm going to end

00:32:34.729 --> 00:32:38.509
 with the will ban video games was worth helium was learning video games for

00:32:38.509 --> 00:32:42.200
 trying to play the kids complement against the disabled I returned account

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:48.780
 disabled now wait a minute and the page there and it has to be removed

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:55.620
 I am I don’t have a good thing there’s no good thing like that, I hope that

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:59.370
 make sure everything is going to be going to be all right pressure is released we defend the

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:02.800
 any time the supreme is judging the collection of

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:11.820
 and the inquiry said who fed it like that

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:18.790
 who used my party name to get elected and don’t think I’ve ever had a two

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:24.240
 seeing this guy was a lot and also the others from alexandre fleet

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:56.659
 now we go every day is I get to the person’s house looking for

00:33:56.659 --> 00:34:01.080
 thinking to say why she activity the side here in the same

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:07.440
 the inside pocket doesn’t have access to the process so I see it in the media

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:12.660
 investigation was not conducted by a federal police delegate was forced to

00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:18.180
 civil police are using the media and that was the situation also for the attorney general

00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:25.410
 the union has a lot of weird things this month and it has to be right and we know that

00:34:25.410 --> 00:34:29.430
 had a respect for the laws now the first place our a this post

00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:35.150
 we must respect the population continues the trial at the supreme next week

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:40.970
 something that has already happened in the trial of tse o

00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:47.510
 here, the electoral justice prosecutor gave a favorable opinion on the evidence

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:53.840
 supreme inquiry can be used in that inquiry the test is i hope

00:34:53.840 --> 00:35:01.280
 that everything be done in the light of the legislation that do not abuse what no one can

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:07.550
 admit to being aware is because of your violated intimacy to answer a

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:13.400
 process perhaps and coordinated by that kind of evidence that is evidence among the

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:19.310
 that are being produced this obviously only makes public opinion

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:26.890
 more and more hostile to this is this the one here this is that that utility

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:33.250
 good so that's it i hope everything works out right because we here on my side

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:38.380
 side here we always have on the side of the law of order we always defend our

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:44.890
 building democracy freedom and we have more with a right we have a duty to

00:35:44.890 --> 00:35:50.920
 demand that everyone without exception is to have a line similar to ours has after all

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:58.230
 accounts there is not a single word of mine in the sense of seeking to censor the media

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:07.049
 controlling the media there is not all governments to have existed and not only does

00:36:07.049 --> 00:36:11.200
 institutions is integral inscriptions with life itself believed i believe

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:15.510
 which is very veiled comes the days of the time that I'm attacked

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:20.880
 Livia, right? It's like the story with the cricket, the Bible in the playpen, and that was worth it.

 chatting none the 45 years of company for quiet conversation in the reflection and

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:41.040
 nothing because it starts healthy I don’t know in certain people of it a certain lake of

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:47.220
 press to make it hellish to provoke and I avoided is to talk to this

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:53.450
 kind of professional between quotation marks leaves it tight, you know here globe

00:36:53.450 --> 00:37:00.960
 standard sheet and common value cut a few weeks 25% loose personal then

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:05.310
 now preparing to give more occurs I'm not holding the event also for

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:09.010
 because of the way it deals with the serious pressure that selection

00:37:09.010 --> 00:37:15.970
 and it’s possible to release the pressure, there is no discussion about some things I

00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:21.880
 yesterday I selected a bill cu8rso will be published already painted

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:28.030

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:50.400
 square is I don't have to take it in Ceará

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:55.690
 determined the military police to remove the flag of brazil from cars a

00:37:55.690 --> 00:38:00.039
 for what I do the military police will respect the whole class of Brazil this

00:38:00.039 --> 00:38:03.940
 type of death is used if you buy the one working in Brazil there will be

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:08.260

 expression is priceless and even if I say live the testimony there testimony

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:26.710
 I don’t return donizete de morais there long ago judging in high points possible of

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:32.970
 of a project a law voted in the national congress is in the sense that

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:39.099
 that they couldn’t they didn’t want some parliamentarians who didn’t have

00:38:39.099 --> 00:38:44.530

 daily is to laugh at these games in those less than ignored

 there was a Brazilian company with the series that worked and said that it’s a good thing that

00:39:27.559 --> 00:39:31.880
 state did not follow the police brazil so proportionally died even

00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:37.019

00:39:37.019 --> 00:39:42.660
 of isolation and everything that has to do with the behavior of the people their

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:46.529
 governors and mayors the federal supreme court ruled it was not

00:39:46.529 --> 00:39:52.290

 a trillion reais the third installment to be made next week you already marked the

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:38.859

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:53.650
 who receives and gives one is 600 you know I know 650 there 30 times but you thing is bigger

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:59.710

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:18.820
 intending is to increase the best two installments already ok

 spend another 100 billion reais as you would like if you could

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:33.430
 call but if not the activities a lot we

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:39.400

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:45.700
 on the inside the interest rate is long-term has dropped a lot if we are not careful to

 selic can go up right back to him in the records of brazil right from the staff

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:59.410

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:03.910
 that us wealth goes to pay interest on the debt that is to say and the misfortune sees there if

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:07.960
 Brazil has no personal break for anyone, no one for anyone and we

00:49:40.949 --> 00:49:46.859

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:09.099
 multi setra I haven't had access yet because we have 15 days to sanction or

00:50:09.099 --> 00:50:13.880
 veto that all the impact that we are going to analyze

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:18.470

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:22.160
 property next week say that the piece of this project and what perhaps

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:27.650
 we will be or not but it seems that something over there that extrapolates a little bit

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:33.230
 do not understand the role of the state accept the camera thinks paper many times that the

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:39.110
 laughter that I do mending and other times to correct what they do is

00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:43.250
 vetoed and after keeping it I don't see democracy like that so we have to

00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:49.820
 people now popular participation the pressures the comments the months can

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:53.810
 practical view taxes is essence of democracy what the guys we leave the

00:51:09.609 --> 00:51:13.829
 of the pride that he had him personally

00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:18.719
 and this obviously you have to treat anybody authority for due

00:51:18.719 --> 00:51:24.359
 respect and we know that there is a lot of respect for the person

00:51:24.359 --> 00:51:28.979

00:51:28.979 --> 00:51:35.969
