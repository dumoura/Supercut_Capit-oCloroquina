 possibility so I'm really happy because when doing

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.350
 the best time with the ball but the municipality does not have a week that

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.000
 approximately 5,000 mayors here in brasília i use the word that could

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:54.489
 mayor is the mayor vadico and the vice mayor of noel did not do anything

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.860
 paulista right I want to visit the meet one marked the

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:08.290
 my life I got there the years 65 64 65 and leaving there is the beginning and 73 for winning

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.790
 contest can put the entire career of the army and without cramming scenario

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.299
 to be approved in the senate of that time by the military

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.400
 the teaching is of quality, the teacher had the power to exercise his authority in

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.370
 classroom and I live in the city

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:36.910
 here the jiló and we have some good news

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:46.290
 great part of the young people he managed together

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:55.310
 nélio mendonça and managed to change the interpretation is one of those of law

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.379
 the document is less individual that we often play with problems

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:05.420
 of the prefecture's cash flow is better it could not be released

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.489
 john chapel goes first to see with his management on Sunday playing around

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.360
 of the game was the president good night good night will not use

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.840
 although all Brazilians are watching here

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.760
 the idea of ​​the government in the chamber managed together then as president spoke to the

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.870
 attorney general of the union in order to change the interpretation of a provision

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.120
 of the constitution that prevented mayors like us present here from

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.169
 São Paulo municipalities and five municipalities across Brazil is the one who asked for

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.419
 mayors receive funds from individual amendments by parliamentarians

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.060
 normally parliamentarians have federal deputies for example 15

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.550
 millions spend to distribute in their electoral bases in a way that creates in

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.970
 schools hospitals and extract equipment and this interpretation

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.930
 previously in force in other governments is to prevent it is not

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.580
 possible to decentralize many times because mayors inherited days and the

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.840
 minister was touched by the change in the medium the president approved an opinion

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.740
 now it is mandatory for the entire public administration and this will

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.720
 privileging parliamentarians will allow them to continue to shine in the

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.639
 tip of the line and helping the Brazilian population

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:26.689
 received the benefit of his work and the government to sell cattle for example the

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:31.289
 mayors and vice mayors the fateful I don't know if you fit that

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:37.759
 situation imagine what environmental cause is the glue where they were served there

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:48.659
 also last night i was invited by the minister of culture

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:53.669
 we are in a group of approximately 30 ambassadors

00:05:53.669 --> 00:06:02.909
 kilometers for me for her a lot month starts fast and I said I put my

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:06.569
 building pronouncement brazil is a wonderful country there are people

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:12.150
 of the whole world in here that everyone should be doing just as I said in

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.879
 anywhere the guy will find a place on the team while the guys and there

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:21.139
 pretty quick speech

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:29.990
 I hope that this business and trade environment in countries will go beyond that, right?

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:44.610
 overflows so that so that friendship the interaction increasingly

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.949
 latent our life does not exist this story of many times

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:55.110
 talks to tell you that i am against certain country he rejected them not

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.470
 respect religion everyone Brazil wants to do business

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:04.800
 with everyone in my old medina of the time press that one thing is what

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.270
 this is a question of how the Brazilian company likes itself very effective

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.310
 our president meets this festivity of diplomacy by demonstrating

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.120
 the rapprochement now also with the Islamic world

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.930
 thinking about the commercial point of view we think the point of view of

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:26.340
 improvement of our reporting relationship, but obviously taking into account

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.550
 principles he has already designed during his campaign which is the

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:35.280
 continuation there is absolutely no division of peoples in the sense that we

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:40.590
 we all approach are important for our brazil for our society not

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:45.090
 exists for any of us business in brazil

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:58.320
 lie here the weather see today see it says here in at least

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:12.890
 four of them area and went there is none

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:23.280
 all these changes at every moment present in that goal at some point

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:29.540
 demands on everybody with a lot of dignity with a lot of correct tension we

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:36.810
 very profitable and a much better topic was dealt with in the political mind

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:44.960
 it was then this is this but this lie guide ball or part of the press

00:08:47.209 --> 00:08:54.290
 the benefit is every day 3/4 phenyl on us but let's get straight to talking to

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:58.339
 press she is very important in the relationship with our president

00:08:58.339 --> 00:09:03.559
 the president understands her as the institution despite the fact that the

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:08.119
 shopping is effectively determined from this calculation the truth is

00:09:08.119 --> 00:09:12.220
 presented translated into english

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:19.699
 we had today we celebrate in the morning a hundred days of our government is a lot for

00:09:19.699 --> 00:09:23.660
 talk to you other hands because you don’t want to complement what was

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:29.360
 treated there our era we are revoking advice are

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.189
 approximately a thousand you from the federal government believe a thousand county

00:09:34.189 --> 00:09:38.959
 they even want with 50 and we will do it for sure in the next

00:09:38.959 --> 00:09:58.549
 weeks have advice that is on holders and six alternates 10 thousand

00:09:58.549 --> 00:10:03.079
 who will pay the bill for the ten books of boarding a car bus

00:10:03.079 --> 00:10:10.459
 particular as an airline manager lodging at the hotel and we want the

00:10:10.459 --> 00:10:20.299
 better for the Indian night until a human being as in the front will stop

00:10:20.299 --> 00:10:28.540
 exist in Brazil

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:42.450
 this one, that’s good, it’s exactly stabilized, we haven’t solved us

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:55.230
 here is a path that sent nothing more than that is to continue here we

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:59.030
 government then reduced from 29 to 22 ministries

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:06.480
 we cut 21 thousand positions and paid functions a decree that has a scene

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:12.420
 a certain buzz that made the issue of the possession of a firearm more flexible, that is,

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:18.720
 almost impossible to buy a water which you depended on the will of a delegate

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.020
 where you had to prove the actual need

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:28.050
 we just left let him give up in a very smart way right

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:38.370
 the priest who brought it again meets 2016 so state that we had to

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:41.850
 deaths per 100 thousand inhabitants in Goiás by 1 10

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:47.120
 after the fire is circumvented the effective need

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:30.090
 the suspect to the federal police shop in a conflict shopping mall is one of the most

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:35.260
 democratically I decide for us and this here then this week's decree

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:39.790
 next we’re going to invite the parliamentarians the idea here of the vehicle

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:43.540
 kombi at school details of public security in são paulo police officers

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:51.130
 federal and civil police tennis - integrating the armed forces in common

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:57.070
 agreement we show him to leave after all this decree that will facilitate

00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:02.380
 a lot, right, the lives of these sniper collectors and the home of the other decrees

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:06.370
 about that miró and we intend to present a bill

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:13.120
 listening to the deputy he would have to be down to earth 3722 but he wants to simplify the

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.080
 that she wouldn’t have, let’s listen to her and be a project

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.640
 ours we have to ask for urgency is to condition it is also faster instead

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:28.020
 but it will all be inspired by deputy peninha from santa catarina

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:36.850
 but I sing I think more than everyone's understanding since the beginning of

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:42.520
 year 2000 this base is there and it does not go forward is a problem because the ball was

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.420
 pt problem did not want to sign an agreement with the united states that i

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.990
 i always say united states but we will repeat miami

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:56.290
 enjoying family vacation in hawaii taking there there is nothing to say

00:13:56.290 --> 00:14:01.570
 so it's all right is that it was personal and very basically at least one source

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:06.490
 national is a person who prides us all for the things he was yesterday

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:11.680
 at the congress was applauded even for the position

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:17.860
 so there is a place that was he was going to make a profit from

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.930
 documents that the chamber the senate will answer the call of everything is also to do

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:28.750
 with this bug currently in the conventions and is and will be to prove a

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:32.310
 very important thing here

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:43.210
 the north-south railway role a part of it completing its three and a half years

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:52.839
 for more than a thousand km so why would any minister this stretch

00:14:52.839 --> 00:15:00.339
 of the highway was purchased at the full price offered by us and within

00:15:00.339 --> 00:15:05.500
 approximately three years we will have here then concluded this north railway

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:11.339
 south connecting national port in tocantins in the far west of são paulo

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:16.420
 to exemplify it was a great job also from the deputy state of Goiás

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:21.280
 federal representatives are 17 federal deputies and three senators from the state of goiás

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.410
 we held meetings a meeting was on the eve of launching

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:28.850
 at the auction the minister was present the state governor the deputies

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:32.899
 federal senators and also a member of the public prosecutor's office at the

00:15:32.899 --> 00:15:38.420
 tcu and is an example of interaction between the powers everything is right, the level of union

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:44.209
 union states chamber and senate discussing to promote brazil from a political

00:15:44.209 --> 00:15:49.129
 efficient public that the next day we went so it is são paulo with beginning ace

00:15:49.129 --> 00:15:53.959
 is doing an exceptional job and really the price that was bought by

00:15:53.959 --> 00:15:57.740
 double what was in the notice proving that this interaction between

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:03.230
 legislative and executive cannot bring will certainly bring real benefits

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:07.490
 of the Brazilian population the authorship press the button on the paper to

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:14.569
 something has been under construction for 33 years and is now going to be completed

00:16:14.569 --> 00:16:26.920
 now here the globe and there will be a rise in the noel guard the monday

00:16:27.009 --> 00:16:37.870
 preparing to better serve the band had parliamentarians with the government to

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:42.769
 seek solutions to your present problems that was your intention to

00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:48.740
 complementing the apb to the north-south era comes to add up in a process of integration of the

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:53.240
 modals so it is therefore Brazil from north to

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:58.720
 south or to the middle and kick sisu is already imagining the paving of br 242

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:04.130
 informs to allow the flow of the harvest functions in the region of Mato Grosso and the

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:09.949
 same time throw my god the br-163 up there the output of this production in the sea

00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:15.199
 for cabotage and long haul transport is not really the integration of

00:17:15.199 --> 00:17:20.209
 all modes in order to facilitate and enrich our country since he spoke

00:17:20.209 --> 00:17:29.750
 is 63 stop for the countless so take the stop that is avoiding a gun a

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:35.570
 highway that started there in the geisel government was opened in place will be completed the

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:42.140
 government our god wants right now year ie the Brazilian is accepted the

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:46.040
 challenge and as soon as the rainy season in the region ends he starts the

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:51.590
 paving of br 163 that is missing so that the whole harvest produced in the

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:56.750
 central west has a calm flow that the heart of style in brazil can

00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:02.140
 call his death the example of that army f block he made a call

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:07.220
 dignity of practically all engineering units to compose a

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:12.350
 team that will provide br the construction and resurfacing of br 163

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:17.780
 with human resources prepared so the person knows about the paraíba goes

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.350
 working at br-163 spends three four five months

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:28.940
 in fact I thought that the life of the paraiba military left him today is ours

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.660
 minister of science and technology but remains sensational rate is in

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:37.669

00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:41.440
 psdb thank you very much sometimes

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:47.110
 all right then I was champion is what is doing something is inaugurating the

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:52.450
 testing center and signaling technologies must have already looked for a

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:57.759
 at that time you have Israeli technology much at the disposal of the

00:18:57.759 --> 00:19:00.730
 our dna we can understand the enthusiasm is

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:08.740
 that can israeli rainfall without less than the cna at the destination

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:15.340
 shows a and we have a problem with lack of water with almost nonexistent poultry farming

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:22.000
 or very deficient in this region, the event helped many people

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.909
 speak see what is being done what he

00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:29.559
 can take buy buy in the market the government can also offer for him

00:19:29.559 --> 00:19:35.470
 so that he can take it to the inter or the hinterland there he can then that the water

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:39.850
 go down analyzed in clear has machinery that is not finishing is a guy like that

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:45.700
 disorganization even the adhesion map that this work and you take the salt from it is another

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:50.799
 technique also removed the water from the air and helped them to the energy source so

00:19:50.799 --> 00:19:59.190
 everything indicates are photovoltaic plates ie solar energy and a source

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:06.870
 israel there he also had the information that

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:15.990
 wife's israel investing in a factory having the equipment in the northeast would be

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:29.570
 planted there were in the drinking water in your region in speaking

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:32.750
 northeast we also announced today 13th of the scholarship

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:36.529
 family there behind a project went to bed and

00:20:36.529 --> 00:20:42.019
 stayed in the senate with the pt senator who gave an opinion against the 13th scholarship

00:20:42.019 --> 00:20:47.960
 family and it didn't come out so now it's in the classic hit the cheat

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:52.669
 we have enough resources to pay the thirteenth for those in need

00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:58.450
 the third is a is a reality of our government

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:06.679
 what positively surprised us and touched a few days for her gave deputy

00:21:06.679 --> 00:21:13.940
 joão campos de goiás he brought a reasonable that he would like

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:24.049
 who didn’t have a summer night, they know that there is a meaningful project to

00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:36.320
 listen to the Minister of Mines and Energy to do a feasibility study

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:41.029
 we don't have summer because it is always said for us and life on the planet

00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:46.360
 study no longer has the economy because I was typical of mosul in egypt

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:51.430
 15 15 hours so there is no need now for bad ok this was the

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:55.510
 finger because it is not a medicine is talking to the health personnel our

00:21:55.510 --> 00:22:01.330
 here in the presidency is from heaven so in a way a lot of people have their

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:07.510
 biological clock is attacked this new summer time right

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:11.980
 that is, people get drowsy at the service

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:16.420
 o stayed awake at night but it is good to have the archeological zone this influences the

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:22.390
 productivity of the human being at the end of so the decree is ready good and in

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:26.890
 next week the presence of joão campos and other parliamentarians who have a project is

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:31.810
 of the government in the sense of having a canoeist resolved the heart demonstrated

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:37.170
 through our social media analyzes and surveys an apartment

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:44.080
 classic in tokyo the page has nothing to do with my vacancy

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:48.890
 it is too early with this exchange of this picture that doesn’t look

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:52.700
 my page of anything else I had was people have more followers

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:57.049
 I believe that 90% acceptance of the end of the plane

00:22:57.049 --> 00:23:02.210
 the remaining 10% of the missing staff will disturb my beer late o

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:04.730
 guys I'm sure everything will be

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:09.110
 running out of energy because of the event is called having a beer with

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:15.799
 all sure that in the place were left brasilília next week inviting

00:23:15.799 --> 00:23:22.159
 to replace here you will not accept it so you don’t know today right

00:23:22.159 --> 00:23:27.549
 is the evocation of more or less 50 decrees that want democratization

00:23:27.549 --> 00:23:38.860
 other other final lawyers will pass the time we had a 1903 document

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:42.340
 still in force

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:56.470
 it's a very debatable thing many ship many parents want to get out of

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:10.990
 government in the project in the chamber a project

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:19.530
 remote site has competence doing after work and simplifies

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:26.190
 quite the stoi dedé that has in view what happens in Brazilian education

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:30.390
 he would be calmer already the child at home he signing for the school

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:33.990
 so we're going to open up that possibility since the parliament is not new

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:43.680
 the chamber the senate is good almost with this proposal will now choose the love that

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:49.800
 completes 100 days of government as 35 goals achieved and now we are going to

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:55.200
 provoke to leverage other goals under the leadership of our continent to

00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:01.140
 demonstrate our identity from someone else thank you so much for the way already have

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:09.090
 almost o many people who stay there will have in the fields

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:20.100
 the young woman now a journey would then speak to 30 thousand, which is little but if I

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:23.900
 remember during the campaign last year one of them peaked at 420,000

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:31.100
 online the new drug arrives in italy what

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:38.690
 was done is the only secretary asks that whoever would also be able to occur the

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:51.890
 little jorginho is going to make a trip to israel that visits places and leave in the desert

00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:00.400
 I see that big big watermark above the contest

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:05.470
 here we in all of fish partnered with paraguay and had israel had will have

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:11.110
 also a novelty at the time under pt chico class it was green and red

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:14.620
 rain with beer no one when is the legacy plan the

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:20.260
 champion in the opportunity the people brazil has eight of 500 km of coast 7

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:24.670
 thousand cubic kilometers of water is from renewed water resources

00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:28.900
 we need to transform brazil in addition to being a major producer of grains and

00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:33.640
 other proteins is also a major producer of fish

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:40.390
 after all capital today we are the 13th world producer of fish and

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:43.929
 with all due respect that we have respect for all nations

00:26:43.929 --> 00:26:48.480
 but with so many resources today we are after countries like vietnam and bangladesh

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:52.630
 it's egypt and even the chile that here on our side

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:56.650
 not to see them but headlights with our potential

00:26:56.650 --> 00:27:04.420
 we need to grow and obviously you know that there are resources from the sea to fishing

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:10.500
 it has a biological limit but we cannot go out issuing licenses and

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:15.760
 capture more than the state if we compromise biomass in species and

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:18.460
 such so where Brazil is going to grow let's go

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:23.440
 follow the example of china china today is the major producer of fish farming

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:26.740
 world culture and here in brazil with so much water

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:30.460
 neco both gyssel of the dams and itaipu

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:35.350
 we have every condition to be also a world player in the production of

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:38.170
 fish then came to captain brought a

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:43.000

00:28:14.159 --> 00:28:19.979
 on your social networks was the issue of tilapia is on the skin of the tilapia is that I

00:28:19.979 --> 00:28:27.450
 wanted to have an important data today is 97% of burns are treated that has

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:33.599
 are low-income people and Brazil today has the importance of technology

00:28:33.599 --> 00:28:38.460

 Brazilian industry capable of producing this skin so that we can learn

00:28:53.039 --> 00:28:55.950
 our brazil the economy captain to be millions

00:28:55.950 --> 00:29:03.239
 not only is it because of the old resources that gauze tape is used that causes

00:29:03.239 --> 00:29:08.820
 a lot of pain in the wound on the foot of the burn mark but also on the skin of the tilapia

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:14.429
 can make potent medications can cover brain is in the event of an accident is

00:29:14.429 --> 00:29:18.749
 a wonderful product and we have already produced a part of this tilapia and

00:29:18.749 --> 00:29:24.989
 short we will double the national production is of obstacles so we are working

00:29:24.989 --> 00:29:31.769
 captain for our brazil 11 with love with a diligent and we are sure that the

00:29:31.769 --> 00:29:35.940

 hunter not selecting the hectare of water and heavy mud I produced 10 to 15 surface

00:29:47.670 --> 00:29:53.250
 before killing curing that same ecta ​​if you liked important modifications

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:56.850
 while oil production is even more lethal

00:29:56.850 --> 00:30:05.100
 only then would it be 100 to 150 tonnes in order to prevent that country from happening outside the

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.280
 hotel now cancer is a bad week

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:12.270
 now working to be a giant to accompany me, the captain suffered two

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:19.280
 surgeries an advertisement for social agents of the hill i'm also carioca

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:39.300
 needing there is a possible that is not we have today two trucks of

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:44.340
 documentation of you artisanal fisherman or professional fisherman and search for

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:48.270
 fishing all the documentation that you sent to Brasília to make this

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:53.070
 trip was a drop pipe around there we took all of this we’re digitizing

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:57.330
 a very slow process takes approximately one year

00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:01.560
 but we will give a prompt answer to each one of you who deserve all the

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.320
 our respect we are working for our class

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:08.760
 reminding you that the agriculture and fisheries secretariat already has to grow

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:13.260
 with sustainability says we are committed to sustainability we

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:17.670
 we know of our worldwide role in this, we are also committed

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:22.890
 and fish farming, beekeeping is for me, that is, we only have farmers

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:27.660
 say let's be a capital fish farmer too

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:35.610
 there in space and one of everything that is beautiful but I'm going to do a search now is

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:41.190
 take the research team you believe old tilapia fillet with everything

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:49.170
 to her or another athlete receiving touch which is the biggest challenge was new but he

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:54.660
 just for the news that federal deputy delegate marcelo freitas made a

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:59.610
 excellent job presented his report on the new beginners and

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:04.560
 we need to approve we are walking we hope to build a path that

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:09.960
 next week on the 16th 17 Tuesday or Wednesday that we can vote and

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:14.550
 approve the report at the ccj then we move on to the special commission and

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:16.890
 plenary our intention is that we can

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:21.180
 approve the new pension then in the two houses at the end of the first

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:25.920
 semester beginning in the next semester so that the reflexes in case of this approval are

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:30.870
 this year we can move on to other absences in the chamber and in the senate as

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:34.910
 tax reform and says that a good start from the middle of the infrastructure

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:38.880
 privatizations and so many others that I'm not sure that parliament

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:43.650
 Brazilian can take can bring benefit to the Brazilian population

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:48.660
 only the new pension you are already rosenthal can be sure you will

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:52.560
 receive your retirement until the last day of your life and so that

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:58.470
 they will take beauty is the certainty that when you retire you will receive at

00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:05.130
 bank is hesitated to its inactivity earnings the retirement process

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:11.740
 this search alone we don't need to prove the new president

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:16.600
 another news without a personal home you always ask us there with the opening of

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:20.290
 European community to export back to the European community after

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:25.540
 we started to deliver is taking a while to use these documentation from the past

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:29.380
 the previous secretaries previous administrations started to delay and not

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:34.270
 respond to the health protocols of European countries and producers

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:39.670
 Brazilians of all sizes because it leaves there a taste that is basically caught

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:46.830
 there by the producer is artisan even other big fish like tuna mecca anyway

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:52.660
 they lost a lot of resources they lost money even right their activity for not being able

00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:55.240
 export to the european community and to israel

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:58.900
 so I want to tell you that we are on a task force within the ministry

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:03.790
 agriculture with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and probably there

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:09.629
 we sent a second action plan now 15 to 15 days ago and we are waiting

00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:14.440
 looking forward to a positive response from the European community that will affect

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:19.629
 also israel when we were there with the prime minister and now the winner of the

00:34:19.629 --> 00:34:24.310
 elections there I see my little land asking him to change is to accept

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:27.280
 Brazilian fish are also concerned with the

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:31.720
 marketing to positively affect our business

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:34.050
 producers

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:40.210
 israel has a nathaniel jales software your party has a home

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:44.740
 quite numerous with certainty including that he remains the

00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:49.389
 prime minister of israel so congratulations best wishes and good luck

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:55.540
 in btl detail we will have it in your possession again a little bit is not complicated

00:34:55.540 --> 00:35:00.880
 for us but it is a difference that God continues to bless Israel and our

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.570
 dear brazil strong hug to all and until the fifth

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:07.800
 next fair if god wants
