00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.380
 mp of the sale of real estate was a provisional measure so that

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.690
 the sale of this material is more agile and a resource used so that to combat

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.930
 organized crime itself but mp allows us to hire engineers

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.270
 to build prisons something that is expensive right hiring staff

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.660

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.050

 when people fall, they invented a business in the government and talking about the bolsonaro is where

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:01.449
 said this or that and put it like a micro 90

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:06.520
 nobody says anything in the press i'll believe the 100 thousand points here to my

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.460
 friend general ramos who is coming to take over the government secretariat to the face

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.120
 started with the right foot the infant started with the right foot here

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.830
 in brasil we all believe in his ability even for his past life

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.080
 with regard to politics he was a parliamentary advisor for two

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:34.539
 years he was attaché is israel now still commands the

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:39.810
 Southeast military command a person dear to everyone and I'm sure that

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:46.690
 will improve and a lot is this dialogue with parliament is done by our

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.740
 dear general ramos who takes advantage of that since the press likes to talk it is mine

00:05:50.740 --> 00:06:00.430
 friend since 1973 when we sat in the square on March 8 of that year at school

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.889
 preparation of army cadets in campinas campinas the city which I

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.610

 a hug and we honor you at the beginning of next month we will be there for you

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:19.120
 of command for who will succeed him obviously in this important command

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.860
 military southeastern sao paulo

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:32.360
 come on a question quickly here we have a bill that deals with the

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:38.990
 of the traffic code, right and among other things we want

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:44.659
 the driver's license expires from five to ten years and we there in the

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:48.830
 project we are ending the monopoly of the DMV

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:55.550
 the southern concession of the health certificate that first 300 reais and even more the

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:04.490
 our our minister of infrastructure the tarcíso together with the contran has already ended with

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:10.699
 the compulsory nature of simulators, so more or less 380 driver's licenses

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:16.689
 once the chamber approved that bill i hope the senate bed itself is

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:22.580
 it will be cheaper at $ 600 on your driver's license I don't know who

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.779
 attack but the people have to go to the governor also governor

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:31.460
 has a share in this high price of its national driver's license is not

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:37.879
 only the federal government is not doing our part to take something important

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:42.830
 the senate just days away from a red card at

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:48.409
 our arms ceiling to those who decreed that he spoke of possession of a firearm and also

00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:53.810
 of the cacti so look, I believe that the chamber

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:58.069
 will reverse this situation Tuesday or Wednesday the chamber must vote this

00:07:58.069 --> 00:08:02.089
 question and you should seek your federal deputy

00:08:02.089 --> 00:08:06.409
 before someone says that I'm interfering in the legislature makes it clear

00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:11.270
 which is common when a bill is passed in the senate and comes to

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:16.339
 my table is common in attending deputy and senator looking for me to

00:08:16.339 --> 00:08:21.110
 that there was a device then it is common to happen there is natural does

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:24.860
 part of democracy and I for my part now am also asking that the

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.930
 federal deputies do not accept what was decided by the senate

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:35.360
 this is democracy and I am asking you as a voter the citizen who seeks your

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:39.500
 federal time will also ask that he is not

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:44.330
 welcome do not vote in favor of the Senate tav bill that votes for

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:50.330
 maintenance of the weapons decree the argument has much that has less if

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:54.620
 talked about there is about constitutionality there is nothing conventional

00:08:54.620 --> 00:09:02.240
 people say it’s emotional explains why it’s actually part of parliament

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:07.060
 which is natural and always has both sides I will rarely ever have unanimity

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:12.200
 want you to have no right to own a firearm and in some cases with

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:17.690
 criteria the firearm possession also then you who are in the field for example

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:23.060
 you who are the farmer are a besieger of the midwest our dear goiás still

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:29.690
 the loaded one is tocantins mato grosso do sul the gauchada catarinense right

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:34.880
 I only have the interior of the northeast, there is also a lot of work there is the

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.230
 our friends brothers cover of the plague right who doesn’t have whole using northeast

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:46.550
 I via decree legally comes the rural size for you that I can steal from you

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:51.410
 has possession of a firearm is the troop chairs the house our credit you

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:56.360
 you can ride your horse is yours a donkey and walk around doing it armed then

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:03.460
 that period the farm belongs to you now who's against it i mst

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:08.930
 is the pt and pc do b who are friends of the mst

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:13.850
 Okay, so you have to ask the parliamentarian from any region of Brazil

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:20.650
 who keeps our secret you so street is rural woman owner of the countryside

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:26.089
 you don’t even want to be allergic to femicide there to show it to everyone

00:10:26.089 --> 00:10:31.040
 worthwhile world was difficult is welcome is when she no longer between one

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:36.320
 piece of paper and a gun inside your property that is yours

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.050
 private property is sacred you have the right to walk

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:48.430
 loved to the fullest extent with the possession of a firearm afloat is is just the

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:52.720
 same thing that I had possession of a firearm I could use is in the bedroom and

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.870
 in the bathroom I can't miss this one in the kitchen and the pantry

00:10:55.870 --> 00:11:00.910
 then we have the possession of a firearm or rather the possession of a firearm to

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:05.920
 all the property there in the senate overthrow the senate is over

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:10.810
 the subject isn’t touched on, the camera now turns against what was decided by the Senate

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:17.589
 you country man you country woman will be able to walk armed or armed throughout

00:11:17.589 --> 00:11:20.709
 the extent of your property I will not look for the parliamentary

00:11:20.709 --> 00:11:28.110
 i'm sure the deputies chamber hearing the voice of the people will keep our

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:34.209
 decree of possession and possession of a firearm but it is still only the cac

00:11:34.209 --> 00:11:40.300
 you who are a collector and sniper who so lobbied me

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:44.890
 when I was a pre-candidate after a candidate and at the beginning of the year I also do the same

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:49.930
 thing with your federal deputy or through santa catarina eyes for example the

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:54.700
 state that has more club shooting and not coincidentally is the least violent state

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.959
 from Brazil they were has less allowing has

00:11:58.959 --> 00:12:04.589
 less possession and possession of a firearm is the most violent state and only says here

00:12:04.589 --> 00:12:10.420
 our research, right, even their research, which usually gives a smack

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:14.230
 call here or there but still can't do it or everything stops

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:20.110
 completely the truth you citizens and was entitled to buy 50 cartridges per

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:25.839
 year 50 the number who fixes executive power I fixed a thousand

00:12:25.839 --> 00:12:32.740
 what's the problem nowadays the band is very well armed better

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:37.449
 armament and much more when the demolition that can even the government

00:12:37.449 --> 00:12:42.240
 we want to give you the right to self-defense with this decree

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:49.660
 we are respecting reference 2005 we respect the right to legitimate

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:53.880
 defense then you look for your deputy

00:12:53.880 --> 00:13:00.480
 why the vote must be on Tuesday or Wednesday for them to vote against the

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.400
 of deciding in the senate so that you can't have a fiery one and you know that

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:10.470
 happened after the vote in the senate and us with new parliamentarians was the

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.820
 senator was placed in public, you know, the information I had that two

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:19.310
 senators were attacked social media and asking that it is to bed

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:26.910
 armed protection look at him for that nec who voted against and then he saw himself

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:32.070
 threatened on the internet asking for protection from you that has no outline ask for

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:37.370
 armed protection the government will manage like inside your home

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:42.300
 to end the matter here we will work in that sense i'm sure

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:47.580
 that the deputy chamber will reverse this vote in the senate that after all the

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:52.890
 the will of our population is that we have to prevail in this legislative note

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:58.320
 political executive power we are also employed by the people and the thing of violence

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:03.440
 which are very expensive in Brazil and I'm sure that our federal deputies

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:09.800
 will vote correctly according to the interest of our population

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:17.160
 finishing we approved a credit line of one billion reais last week with

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.930
 interest below 10% per year for the holy house

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:26.280
 we owe a lot to the holy house i owe my life to the holy judge house outside on a

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.550
 first moment first goodbye obviously year later the holy house of

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:32.280
 out after the virtual hospital there in are

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:38.460
 Paulo who treated me to that stab of Adélia, who is now crazy now

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:43.920
 because the game he goes crazy because from now on logical has resource

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.160
 this part is expensive trying to hit the lawyer and

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:53.550
 cover it - do it for free and that's all you need to get into the winning plea

00:14:53.550 --> 00:15:00.630
 no longer worth it because he is crazy and he was affiliated with psol until 2014 but it is still

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:05.010
 to have a bank of expensive lawyers that the kill who works for until now

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:10.009
 where there’s a lot of nebulous stuff, it’s a lot

00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:14.480
 thing that can be solved now is this in wanting that little by ourselves

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:19.999
 here admit that adele is crazy look until he is hired by someone

00:15:19.999 --> 00:15:24.379
 I wasn't crazy until then, the name that

00:15:24.379 --> 00:15:29.209
 appeared well in the deputies bed the same thing if he manages to escape the attack

00:15:29.209 --> 00:15:33.170
 not even coming from outside, right, and if someone in the front was suspicious

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:37.040
 of his name no he told me he wasn’t in brasília taking my name is

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:43.870
 there I was on guard there in the Chamber of Deputies and even more

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:50.569
 look for judicial determination we are prohibited right we not the police

00:15:50.569 --> 00:15:57.079
 federal government to enter the telephone in January by court decision supported by oab

00:15:57.079 --> 00:16:03.050
 that Brazil is this my god of the sky where we are and who doesn’t want to reveal

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:09.439
 attempted murder of this old man this case of mine is very similar to the

00:16:09.439 --> 00:16:16.519
 case celso daniel that nine people who from the poor waiter who served food

00:16:16.519 --> 00:16:22.610
 that night until the other person or a doctor who found the body all died

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:26.959
 or they were murdered in a mysterious way almost the same thing happened

00:16:26.959 --> 00:16:38.860
 with me but if god wants the federal police our will have to give this big

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:51.279
 great great network that tried today

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:57.589
 then we went to the golden state of São Paulo to post a video that I made a

00:16:57.589 --> 00:17:01.929
 public address not more than a minute 50

00:17:01.929 --> 00:17:08.720
 then it's worth the heart I missed this contact with the people

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:13.490
 talking with the hearts of the people in the public square on top of the square's bench

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:18.150
 it's worth it I apologize here i think is to do politics 6

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:24.060
 here in the presidency and being treated this way by the population is priceless

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:28.410
 this human warmth and the trust that the people place in us

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:34.050
 if god wants with the approval of the new investment pension and not here the

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:41.040
 employment will also appear violence will decrease we have everything to work

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:45.740
 let's have faith is trust i'm sure the parliament and senate parliament

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:50.100
 is voted in favor of pension reform because it is not my retirement

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:56.940
 of social security in brazil after ronaldo went to miracatu as well

00:17:56.940 --> 00:18:02.190
 before the golden over we go there in the region in the region of the taquari bar a

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:07.770
 Paraguay Indian reservation saw him and Indians of the

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:13.680
 paraguay says the genetically emerald mental chart and others

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.760
 other minerals so it’s not for nothing that these reserves

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:22.700
 more and more appear here in Brazil and now appear with this wealth in the region

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:27.660
 called ribeira valley and which is actually considered to be the poorest são paulo

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:33.750
 that the economy basically banana so I here at this moment thank you

00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:41.910
 tereza christina saminez culture and baby the golden paulista that we work

00:18:41.910 --> 00:18:47.280
 our possession since before, so that that normative instruction that allows the

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.690
 Brazil mattered not from Ecuador was repealed

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:56.010
 how can there be some what kind I should be liberal but how can I

00:18:56.010 --> 00:19:00.810
 understand liberality one thing is that a banana can leave the equator

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:09.180
 orchard past the channel of the equator for more than pakistan panama walks 10 thousand

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:15.150
 kilometers and arrive at the port of santos climb the mountain and arrive at the ceagesp de

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:20.010
 more competitive than that of the ribeira valley that is 140

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:23.600
 kilometers [Music]

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:28.080
 by all indications it was another one of those articulations of the forum of são

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.290
 Paulo

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:35.040
 and then everything could enter here in Brazil even since the control

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:44.340
 phytosanitary is difficult faced said he was going to be in charge of the equator the

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:49.230
 ours could be importing the morro da baiana to the black sigatoka between

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:55.320
 other diseases that exist, right, it’s in this region that is hotter because

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.700
 take possession of the equator so maybe the name ecuador there we were unable to play and

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.990
 get out of it congratulations a hug is to convey to our minister

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:09.810
 congratulations and improvement once you took a prorated week arrived at the hospital

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:15.000
 okay better for you to win the job you do after we went

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.280
 for the miracatu my minister of mines was with me and

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:26.910
 energy the bento viewpoint and we fly over the graffiti mountains remember the campaign

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:30.630
 personal and then criticized if the graphite amount what

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:34.760
 a lot of smart people happened and asked for the floor

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:43.020
 problem for us in requesting the lava, it’s no use naked of the graphite of

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:49.230
 region if you don't have the technology to separate graphene and look at the

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:56.520
 next years we 89 years the world thinks the economy is moving something in

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:04.320
 around 1 trillion dollars worth of products from graphene is the only

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:11.190
 plan material in the world because the base is the atom in three dimensions not everything in

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:16.170
 three dimensions graphene is no wonder graphene already

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:21.180
 start to appear around this was discovered in 2004 has 15

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:26.340
 years old spelling is not only we have a wonderful research center

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:31.980
 there at mackenzie university in são paulo there was that kids made the

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:36.660
 huge demonstration there and they let me enter those games is sexist

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:41.649
 racist fascist have not passed the tie is our duty is not

00:21:41.649 --> 00:21:45.880
 contaminated size is with this type of people there we were the

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:50.740
 southeastern military command to contact engineers with researchers the

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:55.570
 landmarks bridges our minister of science and technology is in contact

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:59.260
 we had contact just now a researcher from campinas also who is a

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:04.360
 different method of removing graphene from separate graphite is not ideal yet

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:08.590
 one more big one more step you took we are studying the possibility of

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:11.350
 put a research center there in miracatu

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:16.809
 but obviously we have to bear in mind that there is a right to lava if anyone goes there

00:22:16.809 --> 00:22:20.380
 If you do not have the right to speak, you have to pay a fortune

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:25.510
 will have this 114 and Brazil loses with that we will look for a way to

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:32.139
 solve that issue 16 14 is the golden one then we went to march

00:22:32.139 --> 00:22:38.110
 for jesus there in the mars field in são paulo today we learn to use a page

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.690
 from the field of mars to make a military college

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:46.000
 I was invited by the apostle estevam hernandes and by the bishop sônia was

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.820
