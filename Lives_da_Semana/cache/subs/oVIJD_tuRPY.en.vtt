 previous periods bridge over the xingu river the feasibility was studied by

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.310
 part of the ministering wisdom that waits for next week is free of the virus he

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.170
 is present on my side here and he must have already contracted the project for

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.739
 engineering and environmental license, that alone takes almost a year, but I would like

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:51.310
 was faster but unfortunately it takes time but what matters here brings you back

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.980
 had everything in that form to eliminate the technical viability of the bridge the

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.030
 cost-benefit ratio if it really would be worthwhile for the union to spend on

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:07.080
 bridge and then you will find Ó and the transportation of special grains from the

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.980
 compensating region quickly he already dispatched then to the feasibility study

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:22.830
 technical measure 984 freedom in football and this is going to give what that

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.600
 speak ahead right 16 teams from the first division of the videos are

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.720
 favorable to her okay a large part of the second division team are also

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.950
 favorable forecast is forecast for mana, perhaps the people from the Northeast will come in the second

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.510
 division comes to brasilia and being fine I already let you know when she is very

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.520
 receive them who know how to show a chat with him and the second division is very

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.160
 important here in Brazil you can see that this provisional measure you know

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.140
 and it is freedom in football over football sport to negotiate the right to

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.370
 arena on the image day with which television well understand other media

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:07.720
 whatever it is that I want to sell the image of yours of your game then

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:14.230
 I had a dante then I would pass to its owner that date of the sale of that senai and

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.070
 also in my scissors a very good thing, you know, the right five percent of

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.020
 all this income is divided for the athletes that entered the field, so the measure

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.639
 exceptional people hope that parliament will not let it lapse the

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:34.909
 who knows how well I am very well thanks to god is the minister onix and also

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:40.759
 the minister milton ribeiro of education the exam virus was committed

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:44.659
 positive and immediately started taking hydroxychloroquine makes it very clear

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:49.279
 that an adherence to the doctor and the patient as was my case I am recommending

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:55.759
 for no one I took 12 hours later I was feeling really good and

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:59.960
 as i am very well thanks to god until today the same thing reported me onix

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:07.680
 also stirring, the minister cut the milton, right, of the education feeling

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.880
 very well also so make it clear here i see today i saw a governor speaking

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.640
 there criticizing a Latin resort I don’t know what talking about science until I remembered the

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.160
 wood is at peace until the state government there sold the college of the

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.230
 we believe in science but there is no proof of scientific income in and

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:32.610
 like a few days and as it is not because there is no scientific evidence right then the

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.680
 what happens you are not recommended and it is also not recommended either

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.700
 neither me nor nor is it all this yet but sooner or later it will arrive at

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:45.510
 conclusion regarding this now while there is no clear remedy right

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:50.640
 to attack this problem is valid in this one because I am not mistaken they call it

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:56.100
 off label this out of the package insert so doctor you know that you have to have this freedom is not

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.030
 in the ass but he stops and prescribes here is to write get strong in

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.639
 prescribes don't want to offer anything else

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:10.150
 and the doctor off layman, right, and the patient and many say that this practice is

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:16.539
 a lot of illness and left without treatment until today a lot of things were discovered, right with

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:22.840
 these attempts that the person has measures with this know that there will be a

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:28.270
 serious problem ahead and we could test this medicine

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:34.240
 there is another 50 years of Brazil, especially in the Amazon region and the one sold there has

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:40.449
 a red stripe here for what I know there is poured without a prescription and has

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:43.449
 some cases with a few meters worked out also have to talk to me

00:07:43.449 --> 00:07:48.669
 Renowned huh has been talking to me saying that his experience his

00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:54.610
 observation from fiorentina has worked so who doesn't have one another

00:07:54.610 --> 00:08:00.279
 alternative that does not want to prohibit hydroxychloroquine for those who

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:07.220
 perhaps I want my suitcase to be prescribed by a doctor from Serra da

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:11.840
 mantiqueira we are there the armed forces are there working around the clock to

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.979

 Amazon region doesn’t have it has nothing red doesn’t set the forest on fire

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:02.220
 it doesn’t catch fire it’s a nasty campaign all the time against brazil because that’s

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:07.260
 well with the economy brazil is a giant in agribusiness ok agribusiness is not

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:11.850
 stopped the pandemic congratulations to melissa tereza cristina to rural producers

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:17.940
 for this wonderful job that you've always done for Brazil, it's always

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:23.970
 thinking after the founding of embrapa and brazil it grew a lot in this area and the

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.759
 our the pepper over a billion people in the

00:11:27.759 --> 00:11:33.100
 world we are leaving for eight billion inhabitants right then leaving

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:37.569
 for eight billion inhabitants more or less there fifteen percent there of the

00:11:37.569 --> 00:11:43.720
 world population brazil feeds its people there for all residents then the

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:48.970
 campaign and what happens is often a newspaper here the one known here does not

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:55.420
 does everything to overthrow the government for and speaks lies publish a lie to

00:11:55.420 --> 00:12:00.429
 company from outside gets public lie there in europe from the company here goes there and takes

00:12:00.429 --> 00:12:06.369
 from europe and come here look how is it I am president in europe she is there

00:12:06.369 --> 00:12:12.119
 underneath it doesn’t preserve the environment it doesn’t care for this or that it’s just

00:12:12.119 --> 00:12:17.139
 there are certain regions here the fire outbreak right there is going to exist with the

00:12:17.139 --> 00:12:21.220
 every year the caboclo is the Indian who sets fire you don’t set fire and culture

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:25.930
 he’s going to eat, he has nothing to eat for the next year and even more

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:31.029
 this is the size of the amazon is bigger than all of europe there is no way to do it

00:12:31.029 --> 00:12:35.620
 inspecting we tried a provisional measure made there with the minister

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:43.899
 tereza cristina that the regulation of land tenure is np910 has expired

00:12:43.899 --> 00:12:49.420
 that is, it was not put into powder if it had been put around it would be approved

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:53.080
 I will the provisional measure of the freedom of football if the foot of the bed puts in

00:12:53.080 --> 00:13:01.240
 I am sure it will be approved ok then with this regularization case

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:06.520
 every piece of land in brazil was approved you could detect by satellite

00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:10.779
 the accuracy is enormous, you would know in the land of those who are that focus, do not understand

00:13:10.779 --> 00:13:16.300
 even more to know if in that area he could practice it or not that he

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:22.120
 arrange Amazon for example twenty percent of each property you can

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.910
 apply you can investing here with you can deforest eighty percent don't

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:32.450
 and it’s almost killed too bitter if you’re going to add the eight twenty years all that

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:38.000
 they must kill in the amazon they killed south america

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.790
 look that it is cleared again that it is allowed to kill itself at that time only

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:46.730
 there was a lack of approval of the provisional measure governing land regulation, after that

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:50.420
 as a provisional measure fell a bill was presented a little

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:57.620
 differently he expects the congress to approve that his helps us not to be

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:02.630
 identify who might have criminally set fire to and killed your

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:07.370
 property is how it will inhibit this practice and this pressure will end

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:14.510
 international and often disproportionate and not true against

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:19.139
 Brazil hi sister in amazonas just for curiosity

00:14:19.139 --> 00:14:23.730
 right at the beginning since the past I don’t know who said it here for me to put the

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:28.529
 source here had the ten percent of the phrase in the world today we have thirty percent

00:14:28.529 --> 00:14:34.009
 percent is not because more water was planted in Brazil here in other countries

00:14:34.009 --> 00:14:41.069
 heard killing here not now when some speak right and reforestation could

00:14:41.069 --> 00:14:43.949
 start the reform is Europe right to take an exam so we don't want to

00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:48.579
 reforest what already has forest here in Brazil in the case of the amazon

00:14:48.579 --> 00:14:53.819
 nature is running out fundeb

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:59.180
 and the initial proposal started to be three years of friends more or less three years

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:09.209
 three years ago the government paid the equivalent of ten percent of the expenditure

00:15:09.209 --> 00:15:14.670
 oh ok about the financing of public basic education and the proposal

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:19.490
 not to go to 40 but what I would go through 80 90 right since

00:15:19.490 --> 00:15:27.480
 had revenue ok now it was a very big struggle the government did its part

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:34.619
 what happens at 40 had to create two cpf is simple right had to increase

00:15:34.619 --> 00:15:39.540
 some federal taxes now can handle creating new tax

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:46.050
 I can take more crying and I can’t take it and Brazil’s education isn’t going well

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:51.240
 a lot of time is more your financial problem is curriculum problem what

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:56.910
 teach the classroom who will not teach ok so the teacher has or

00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:00.179
 not how to exercise your authority in the classroom that without authority you don't

00:16:00.179 --> 00:16:05.399
 can do and teach nothing to those who like military major who didn’t, I didn’t

00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:09.220
 the son before I apply god of the maximum example linking you

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:13.629
 have you ever seen me be from here waiting for a military school is one of 23 girls per

00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:18.730
 new coincidence and they made military college between them for example paulo

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:24.189
 guedes made a military college of bh o levi that walking from one made the military college of

00:16:24.189 --> 00:16:27.670
 Porto Alegre, among many others, some military personnel also attended a military college.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:31.839
 you take the colleges of the military police of goiás than that of the state here of

00:16:31.839 --> 00:16:39.850
 a joão vitor hugo 61 school, there is a school there, the one with approval in the enemy is 100

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:44.560
 percent is 100 percent the same thing military school in the state of amazonas

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:50.589
 also i had one there before the human head a hunk of the campaign gets

00:16:50.589 --> 00:16:55.629
 irritating then the kids really learn because it has to be cousin to have

00:16:55.629 --> 00:17:02.050
 here there is punishment, boy, the boy stays until later to leave the classroom

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:06.909
 class ok this is the punishment right let's say i'm trying to beat up kid not

00:17:06.909 --> 00:17:09.199
 has nothing to do with it is not right has to art

00:17:09.199 --> 00:17:15.740
 the sound there with homework goes on the boy presents inside the house on the day

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:19.760
 next with this little chat is not going to present the presence like that then

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:24.049
 work has discipline and where the teacher has the means to exercise his

00:17:24.049 --> 00:17:28.970
 authority then runs that the militarized schools of the military police

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:34.909
 with the example here from the amazonas is from goiás military school you don't 13

00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:38.990
 military colleges of the brazil army let's do a fourteenth now in

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:43.070
 if you had the resources, right? I said during the campaign, I wanted to leave

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:48.860
 to do there, there is meat and Brazilian state to at least one military college but not

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:53.600
 I have recourse to this when talking about fundeb, too, we are going to collect

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.960
 least understand that she passed that no one expected this crisis from could

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:03.889
 this thick thick climate with the fundeb that we caught we now support the

00:18:03.889 --> 00:18:09.210
 parliament is going to have to help us where to look for resources to pay for this

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:14.580
 progressivity until it went from 10 to 20 and three percent understand 6 to 12

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:20.159
 years sent from year 10 to 23 percent ok and 10 years will have a review

00:18:20.159 --> 00:18:24.010
 it's also good so in the sixth there will be a

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:27.960
 review to save analyze how is the financial situation of brazil

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:34.390
 because it is more of a mandatory expense, right, there is more and more mandatory expense in the

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:37.510
 budget over ninety percent of the mandatory expenditure budget

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:43.150
 payment of the public payroll is for social security debt charges, right?

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:48.530
 great weight just then i think it hits i'm not sure here but

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:53.360
 the next ninety percent of our company is there now according to what

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:57.710
 happen if there is no source of revenue for example tarciso i will retire not

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:02.270
 going to work on what comes because if you don’t have a budget from the ministry of culture

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:06.320
 the bridge on the xingu river that i said will now be frozen the works are going

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:10.640
 stay frozen so it's a serious problem that we have and today we are

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:15.710
 trying to solve many problems with reforms with for example the reform

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:22.310
 tax now get an already excuse attributes here tax reform now the

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:26.270
 Brazil is one of the worst countries in which to do business, so when the world

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:29.309
 want to grow up here when they see if they are like audi

00:19:29.309 --> 00:19:37.289
 the hole that mouth huge class of fines inspections taxes

00:19:37.289 --> 00:19:41.360
 food goes away then lets go entering the little by little changing leaving

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:46.980
 we have here that beautiful economic freedom, right, it was more like a bean with

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:50.669
 our rice here in Brazil but it was very welcome is glad this girl was

00:19:50.669 --> 00:19:56.820
 in são vicente guarujá or santos i entered a pizzeria and that was i think

00:19:56.820 --> 00:20:02.190
 end of the year but the carnival more or less and the guy was thinking about thanking

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:05.369
 why he was waiting for the license

00:20:05.369 --> 00:20:10.740
 economic freedom he was able to start working and the city had

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:16.139
 30 days to grant the permit to them, right, that doesn’t grant you would continue

00:20:16.139 --> 00:20:22.080
 working here one more thing a question is to release here

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:26.930
 sweet that pops up money i want you the tough question

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:31.970
 augusto nunes take it be a hard question here you see

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:36.280
 and the complicated to answer he put in check here asking certain questions

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:41.170
 here it is not that I run away in the press not the interpretation the next day no

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:45.100
 it is for the young pan that I know that you will fight with a lot of debate with a lot of

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:49.860
 responsibility what you heard about here but other press agencies will get

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:54.670
 15 seconds I said here make a carnival the next day until the team

00:20:54.670 --> 00:21:17.560
 play with all the powers that criticize me legislative augusto I'm

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:21.850
 at 65 I think you have a little more than that right elimination

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:27.700
 normal age, in the rest I feel very well-disposed, I'm a little

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:32.060
 agonized rate portal practically stuck here in the bush

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:38.840
 it is from a room, right, the program for me to see here when the flag is

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.890
 lowering the national flag here became a problem, yes, even if not

00:21:42.890 --> 00:21:46.940
 there are also patriots how many people go there today i stayed about 40

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:51.020
 people sometimes the correct ones over there a little more and what matters

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:55.610
 talk to the people and see the flag being all well some don't need the

00:21:55.610 --> 00:22:00.669
 heart here we take care there in need to be terrified about the virus

00:22:00.669 --> 00:22:06.570
 ah ah i'm already watching tv here all day also ok

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:12.710
 always connected, follow a little of our press here, right, and I can see

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:17.159
 authority right from outside Brazil saying that this pandemic came

00:22:17.159 --> 00:22:22.230
 to stay at least until 2022 for the people have to work my god

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:28.379
 that the consequences, right and not working you are much worse than that

00:22:28.379 --> 00:22:33.690
 provided by the virus itself I want to tell you august right are these

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:37.950
 municipal elections now for sure they will ask for each

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:44.340
 candidate if you take over in January said of next year how will it be the

00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:49.610
 its restrictive policy here in são paulo rio de janeiro goiânia recife

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:57.830
 salvador manaus is a small town too so the candidates for mayor right

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:02.460
 get ready for kind of a question that how are you going to proceed is going to keep

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:07.120
 the same line you get are hi how's the snake line is you

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:11.110
 will keep the snake line if the gas elections there and another

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:15.310
 thing seize the moment is not talked about this is municipal I do not intend to me

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:21.960
 get involved in candidacy for mayor in Brazil I don’t mean I don’t go

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:27.400
 participate in a place another right but I do not intend a person like it very much in mines

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:32.680
 general to see the candidate in bh right maybe a candidate will come

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:36.550
 my city eldorado paulista i will campaign with your 3 thousand

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:42.010
 voters do not intend to maybe collaborate with us there to councilor one another and for

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:46.780
 that because Brazil has problems I have to be worried about the

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:52.050
 unemployment that created children, right, with this policy, from everyone at home

00:23:52.050 --> 00:24:01.360
 terror please fine i will arrest i don't know what it is and brazil's job you want

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:07.490
 our part we help here this as little as possible we help with r $ 600 and

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:13.010
 before you of the people is not mine we did our best but this policy will have to

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:18.340
 will have to be delayed because if we stay we will continue with the isolation

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:22.730
 meet if brazil wins a country of the poor and a country of the poor

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:28.269
 socialism is seeing this fertile ground for that to

00:24:28.269 --> 00:24:34.059
 first wave of life I remember once talking about that in that let's see

00:24:34.059 --> 00:24:39.099
 army truck scavenging bodies through the streets my god in heaven what point we

00:24:39.099 --> 00:24:43.599
 we reached the peak the week that came is I don't know when I don't know when

00:24:43.599 --> 00:24:49.839
 okay, the terror all the time was a boy who spent a lot more there talking

00:24:49.839 --> 00:24:55.409
 it's very special for that television he liked, right than working on it

00:24:55.409 --> 00:25:02.829
 so the panic was spread has unemployment society a lot of jobs the

00:25:02.829 --> 00:25:07.659
 informal calls invisible right a little over 40 million and got lost

00:25:07.659 --> 00:25:12.549
 almost all of them losing their totality in their income, so surviving they manage

00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:18.069
 be real that one day it will end because there is no way the union can pay every month 50

00:25:18.069 --> 00:25:23.349
 billions of rest meet and on top of people you need because if you

00:25:23.349 --> 00:25:27.380
 continue the economy for a long time, there is no time for those

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:32.000
 more savings have to take place is everyone's responsibility and even good

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.970
 that we are having elections ahead of us now so that this issue is going to be ok

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:38.780
 arguing so much could even councilman alderman have to participate and rarely

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:43.850
 of a councilor a parliamentarian is to discuss in this photo it looks like the mayor is not

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:48.200
 running the music for this disease also looks like the governor has nothing

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:53.500
 to do with him have to participate he has to put the guy to press risks

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:58.280
 always putting the economy to work now valcarla at the end of the line is over

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.150
 are concerned with life we ​​are concerned with life but the effect

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:07.640
 collateral even this policy, everyone at home will kill if it’s no longer

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:11.500
 killed many more people than the glass itself

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:18.950
 and help me if you use one I could comment on the sum of the forces of

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:26.509
 security of rio de janeiro the journalist with the stun gun for

00:26:26.509 --> 00:26:31.440
 being possible is also the case of the one you

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:35.720
 security in santa catarina who invaded the home of a ballerina

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:44.730
 because she is receiving friends at home, how do you see this way of

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:50.650
 be the wires is the case of the river I saw the

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:56.670
 images, right, some, I say that he disapproved is always this story, does it act?

00:26:56.670 --> 00:27:00.130
 inadmissible that they made window I thought she was a crucible could not have

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:06.460
 died and look at the security people and respond so I have a lot of friends

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:12.310
 military police firefighters municipal guards alright let's buy a

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:16.570
 car nobody's getting disobeyed and the mayor's governor but measure

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:21.430
 I will also measure it because there is a problem, this guy dies because of

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:25.270
 a stun gun like that you will answer man it will not be the governor

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:30.750
 mayor and another one has no reason to do this is not appropriate for

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:37.450
 that day way as if it were the predator on top a box owner put on

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:40.920
 regarding the isolation correction there is no point this has a new protocol

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:46.340
 I don't know who I want to confirm for example after the 14th

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:51.799
 the cat on the 17th I am not mistaken you do not transmit anymore now I can’t even with

00:27:51.799 --> 00:27:56.000
 this protocol in quotes I will drink coffee better than my doctor today

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.900
 at night I can't go out on the street because there will be a lawsuit with the chicken

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:04.700
 so I will only be able to leave here when there is negative and in this case the

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:09.830
 another him a whole house until the increase itself here wires I got a lot

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:15.470
 these days I think about 20 days ago about 25 that I don’t design here

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:19.130
 came out of bed under restrictive measures I put the pen see has a lot of

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:24.710
 thing one of the things there said about condominium ok the day of being your manager

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:29.070
 building you were there taking a guaraná with three four colleagues in the corner there

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:34.769
 hi and the superintendent not to go with your face on you and just ended up

00:28:34.769 --> 00:28:39.330
 meeting is over chat is over tubaine is not going to take a tubaine is going

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:43.460
 I’m going to change you home so I vetoed the time yes we can this power no

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:48.090
 that's it, you are discussed in a meeting and it was not a decision

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:52.830
 federal and selling about 15 articles in this project I got too much now has to do

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:59.490
 with you here this second house there in a house of a ballerina whose saint

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:03.500
 catarina and i put it in i tried here the imposition of

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:11.240
 fines for non-compliance with the duty to wear a mask I will not teach one a

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:16.070
 federal law here to change by the mask wearing components where

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:19.160
 not even the amount of the fine is given, it would not work would not work in any way

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.510
 way and gave this project this freedom for people to enter the

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:27.620
 residence believe it if you want and this is an absurd thing I think even

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:32.240
 better explore this then show the article vetoed the absurdity that are

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:37.460
 doing I don't want to be there for governor not because the goal of santa catarina is

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:41.570
 elected using my name is very good example of Rio de Janeiro, right and then I don’t know

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:46.400
 that hit people in the head they decided to attack me there wasn’t with

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:51.230
 the intention is right and holy singing is suffering a lot for actions of this type

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:55.610
 part of the governor tião you are not mistaken is a colonel of the fire brigade

00:29:55.610 --> 00:30:00.410
 right is the commander Moses I am not mistaken so yeah I did not see this second

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:03.960
 image and knowing about santa catarina but it is a

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:08.070
 absurdity that has been going on just as well that proves by chance one of the elections

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:13.050
 will be able to comment on this one right and discuss these absurdities now what

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:20.160
 people are proving it is proving a draw it is proving here watching the next videos

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:24.810
 states of Brazil and let the best imagine if I stayed in this mine

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:29.490
 chair that was that guy who came in second in the second round and who

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:34.200
 can is happening all over Brazil because look here the governors of the most

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:38.730
 it’s more radical left wingers, you know, and this guy is from that line that would be

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:46.500
 doing at all taking advantage of this moment ok trust zap sorry here ok

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:53.340
 I am sorry that it would never support a situation of this shock and brings residence

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:57.660
 so there will be three four five eight people chatting ok here there are several

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:00.610
 people there in the field could enter here also there in the corner here away

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:05.559
 the second last here in the corner here ok I could enter here also here I will not

00:31:05.559 --> 00:31:12.809
 entering the store is not going to be okay but you will come

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:18.140
 hi good night president 'the council approved this week the renewal of

00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:22.580
 fundeb the basic education development fund wanted to know the opinion

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:27.230
 about the final text that was approved that is now going to the Senate

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:31.669
 to the liking of the economic team it was a victory of the government the good president

00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:35.660
 night when you know that that economical has its line in any

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:39.799
 government right sometimes it escapes a little bit from what you think now as

00:31:39.799 --> 00:31:43.730
 I said from the beginning back there I have to believe in my minister

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:49.490
 when I believe or are doing something here is in disagreement agreed back there

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:54.830
 what my campaign was milton paulo guedes' hair cut like

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:59.990
 always said back there right my ipiranga post I have to follow his line

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:04.820
 because this is something I disagree with him with for example who gave it a while ago

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:09.110
 here is one was from paulo guedes went to study there from here for economic he

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:13.110
 died burdening the products of the basic basket he did not put

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:22.440
 the job there wages down there the informals have lost your income and we will

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:26.010
 pay the basic basket product there is something there that you can even talk about

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:31.230
 exonerate other things that without comment is soybean rice rice oil

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:39.809
 sugar salt so this is this approval from fundeb here that the team

00:32:39.809 --> 00:32:46.169
 economic it was going to have currency collection fell quite wanted it is a a percentage

00:32:46.169 --> 00:32:52.799
 smaller or start 22 this is true but what happened since it happened that

00:32:52.799 --> 00:32:56.730
 came coast in bed the proposal of forty percent that negotiated for the

00:32:56.730 --> 00:33:00.990
 our side largely by major vitor hugo and general ramos is coming

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:07.980
 at 23 percent and it was a vote by mutual agreement is heavy is it who will do

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:13.120
 the budget, right, a part of the federal government that sends the parliament they will

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:19.059
 the payment does not have to look for a source of funds for that, so the ideal would be that

00:33:19.059 --> 00:33:22.990
 if you are sweetie you don't need a municipality he didn't need to leave he gave but

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:28.480
 we need to answer and we have to understand why fundeb would end there

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:32.530
 this end of the year now it’s not even sunk like the beautiful government was

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:36.850
 united to disunity is has no tendency to break fundraising we

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:43.000
 we reached a 23 percent agreement and the left wanted to bill as if it were a

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.370
 their work they put pressure on the pt doesn’t put pressure on anyone else

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:53.010
 to impress someone pc b b psol without comment has comment now wanted

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:58.170
 right, it's like attacking us saying that we went in defeat our not we did

00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:03.450
 what is so co-responsible is that all party leaders all

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:08.010
 resolution indicated yes half a dozen parliamentary ps and did not put no

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:13.139
 ask him who has doubts ask him who to put has to

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:18.450
 put it in the port, right, part of the press used a lot of good lists, lists voted against

00:34:18.450 --> 00:34:24.700
 fundeb and the lack of character

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:30.820
 that's it bro the wickedness that is common in the middle of this so in my understanding it was

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:34.480
 good size 6 years from now will be reviewed this will be rescheduled to

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:41.109
 over the course of six years we expect the economy to pick up because if it is not the

00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:45.040
 the Brazilian government cannot take more of the tax burden, it is possible to

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:49.690
 recipe agreed with paulo guedes back there has no increase in cargo load

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:54.609
 tax is a truth, there will be a resource to erase this, hence the advantage that

00:34:54.609 --> 00:34:58.650
 will be staggered from next year we want the most that beautiful much more

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:04.240
 but if my parliament's irresponsibility was approved, it presented the

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:08.950
 so this one so congratulations not the camera has already voted in the senate but not every

00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:12.609
 one goes to wait a few more days then the scenario will surely

00:35:12.609 --> 00:35:18.480
 confirm this then hi and the life that follows uses is now here

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:25.140
 we need, right, and it’s not easy to do what education works in Brazil that doesn’t

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:31.800
 works on the left if it boasts of saying that it managed to increase the

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:36.420
 fundeb I don't know what but the inheritance that we have on the left is nothing to

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:41.460
 education nothing nothing and a bad quality education who proves who

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:47.010
 this proves the evidence of the steps in less than 70 countries above the line last

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:51.720
 places the discipline that is charged right that the text interpretation sciences and

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:57.690
 math up to a simple rule of three the 15 year old kids have

00:35:57.690 --> 00:36:01.830
 difficulty in executing simple rule 3 he goes a compound and

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:05.160
 text interpretation also in the seventy percent fails to

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.680
 interpret a text my second paragraph does not understand that it took

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:12.570
 first this sale of the paulo freire method so admired by the left but

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:17.230
 that left the more people the recognition and not see oh I love you

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:21.970
 deleted on papaya one hit a project access the list on the other piece that

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:26.290
 they are interested in dominating education since the military period but

00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:32.860
 now there is no flaw, there is also a lot of things to leave the name there a lot

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:39.670
 focused on human the technical part or mathematics almost in the background

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:45.700
 there is a huge expenditure on education in Brazil, especially in teaching

00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:49.930
 university and to change that there will not be overnight

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:54.700
 arrives the triple list for sale to choose the university dean and

00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:58.720
 logically laborious but people right on curriculum heap of things list

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:02.890
 triple interest that was the most voted or not we will put seeing the

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:09.790
 party affiliation often the guy the 31 is militant is affiliated to the pt another

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:13.930
 good person another person you have no alternative to

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:21.160
 it is because he knows he grandson what in part these people think of education

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:31.180
 in brazil but something facebook 25,000 youtube 32,000 crosses 80,000 that I
