00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.049
a little bit Can working is good night Thursday 24 September 19 hours

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.890
 we are in São Paulo ok I understand now is the event at Academia Militar das Agulhas

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.680
 Negras also an event today at the headquarters of the Police Superintendence

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.669
 Rodoviária Federal side of Rio de Janeiro director general you agile a

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.320
 effect gives me a lot of material for PF PRF really is one of the

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.700
 institutions that we pride ourselves on this does an exceptional job has

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.010
 the record for the seizure of drugs and armaments has been broken, and they too have

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.239
 April to here by coincidence, right? Working since then, actually more

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.329
 so here it’s alright changed the pace of work changed the minister of

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.719
 and in justice and everything started to flow better in the PRF in the federal police test

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:08.399
 So these are institutions that we are proud of on my left here, you

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:14.009
 Letícia is a teacher in Guarulhos I even remembered now because she is talking

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:20.100
 with her I think that at the end of last year like this year a new bid

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.270
 of Presidente Dutra Highway that ends the final descending shirt of the next

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.330
 logically there was a third party proposal to create a new square of

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.520
 toll there in Guarulhos and also between Barra Mansa and Volta Redonda is not

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.360
 to talk to the mayor with more people I also talked to the video

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.360
 Tarcísio and we decided that the bidding will be carried out but without new

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.149
 toll and what's best will reduce I believe that then thirty percent the

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.470
 current tolls at Dutra similarity 14 squares here Rio de

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.259
 January Rio de Janeiro you know I remembered that of Letícia the porter in

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.159
 Guarulhos regarding us something more dangerous the present deny that

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.679
 you authorized the rehabilitation of three squares in urban areas in the city

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.440
 Guarulhos which is very important in the urban green areas program

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.830
 waterproofing the temperature sensation leisure areas with authorized

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:27.280
 and it will be done there in Guarulhos very important is the message of the environment will

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.099
 talk slowly about what affects Brazil right, fire outbreaks in the

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.230
 The Amazon and the Pantanal and the environment, the left takes advantage of this and accuses me

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.730
 right, we’re setting fire there today, we’re not taking steps to pay for the

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.720
 account doesn’t look huge it’s bigger than 4 states together you get in Sergipe

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.709
 you take Alagoas Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo imagined the size of the

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.040
 area what do we do the job of keeping the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.080
 focus we feel more details there are problems in the past wrong measures

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.720
 in the past I have had it in homes will talk here that I potentiate fires when it

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.550
 comes and there the temperature until a few days ago was on average 43 degrees Celsius

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:20.120
 a very large organic mass in view of the wrong wrong measures or

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.920
 criminal take from the past What steps were those President o you have

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.680
 repeated with reason that in addition to the heat Evident drier right temperatures very

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.050
 high in the Pantanal has a series of policies that were adopted there we are

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.190
 mistaken the first is not to leave even circulated must have only seen

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.510
 remember your commented that video of the staff setting employees on fire you me

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.459
 saw that me called Fogo Frio when you were out of the dry season outside the

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.840
 hot period sets fire on purpose in a controlled manner to decrease

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.120
 and organic matter rest of leaf branches anyway and if you don't do that

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.530
 for two years that I have been going on there that material will be

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.610
 accumulating and drying in such a way that when it catches fire the way it is

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.940
 happening now it catches fire in a proportion that is very difficult to control

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.530
 because he didn’t take a preventive measure at the right time and something else that the

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.850
 Pantaneiro, right, the rural producer there in the region.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.889
 was there in the conditioning come and meet me here is there in Poconé in Mato

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:32.700
 Grosso Pantaneiro the rancher there he is a collaborator and the livestock EA Help

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.530
 also decrease organic matter because cattle eat grass eat grass E

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.820
 with that it doesn’t let it accumulate and comes to be seen in that region unlike

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.550
 Mato Grosso do Sul that controlled this issue in Mato Grosso a persecution

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.500
 very large against the result cattle ranchers decreases the cattle increases the

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.820
 amount of capinha de mato when it catches fire

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:01.660
 I’m going to mount a gigantic volume in addition to human impact throughout

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:07.420
 a regional culture is the Indian who sets fire to the fields, the caboclo is also the

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.810
 small producer who sets fire to the fields some I think I should change the culture

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.280
 I wish I could change many cultures, it takes a long time, but not

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.920
 is one who speaks this has no idea what he is talking about so much here could do

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.060
 talk and change change certain cultures here for Urbana in São Paulo that has certain

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.910
 cultures also turned into culture that are harmful to the environment beyond

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.920
 it’s not too long, right You said now it seems that it will change that there

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.410
 to be able to use certain fire blocker blockers in the water so that

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:47.200
 today logically the blocker increases the capacity you muffle and end the

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.160
 fire how do these blocker the President blocker is a product whose

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.830
 chemical composition is very similar to the fertilizer

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.090
 good it lasts in the proportion of 100 liters of water to 1 liter of

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.890
 blocker on the plane on that plane that dumps water to fight the fire and

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.870
 then the flights, they close the water a lot more efficiently with a lot of

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.670
 fewer flights you can block the fire because it’s called a blocker or retarder

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:18.290
 of fire and here for a long time the product was not allowed to use

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.940
 eminently ideological the whole world the United States fire blocker use

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:28.520
 Canada Europe Japan only here that the class was postponing this business raised him

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.680
 the question of the use of fire and the way of Culture

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.760
 last week there was an article in the guardian newspaper the english newspaper

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.300
 saying that in California fires much bigger by the way than the ones that are

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.250
 happening in the Pantanal one of the reasons why a fire is so big in the

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:54.840
 California because there the Democratic government therefore left that is not there of

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.630
 and in a preventive way and the English newspaper says look this is one of the reasons

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:05.400
 why it’s burning so much in California because the Democratic government there

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.320
 prevented the preventive use of Fire

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:15.470
 and another thing here, right? It's about our forest code in

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:20.600
 Amazon region is the legal reserve equals eighty percent of the area then

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:26.600
 those who enjoy a 1,000-hectare property 800 hectares cannot do

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:31.730
 nothing this reserve mass it can work only at twenty percent is

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:36.790
 days from there and Amazon I speak the left calls a liar the forest catches fire

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:41.660
 the core of the forest, which is wet in the part here, it’s not dry, it doesn’t take the

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.920
 that catches fire in the surroundings where there was a decrease in vegetation because there was

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.140
 human intervention this intervention over 500 years right 84 percent of

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.970
 The Amazon is preserved in a primary way, that is, exactly the same when the

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.810
 the Portuguese arrived here 84 percent have no other country in the world that

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:03.230
 has this level the size of the forest as we have and with this level of

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:08.840
 preservation and when a large amount of CO2 carbon dioxide is generated

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:14.009
 it is not in when energy is produced I want to burn it is one I send the

00:08:14.009 --> 00:08:17.310
 forms but the production of energy Brazil for practically eighty per

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:21.539
 percent in clean renewable energy as far out there as opposed to

00:08:21.539 --> 00:08:26.759
 around twenty percent affectionate and in the various it does not consider Brazil then

00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:32.219
 the country that preserves the most now because this criminal attack this misinformation

00:08:32.219 --> 00:08:38.789
 there is absurd over Brazil the economic game we have commodities that

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:43.649
 we produce in the field and obviously countries is I don't want to quote the name here to not

00:08:43.649 --> 00:08:47.940
 have controversy more stay just should know which European country is very funny

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:53.399
 this makes a massive campaign against Brazil accusing it of its terrorists

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:58.140
 we know that this is not true, it is the same thing the collection of

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:05.399
 other reserves in Brazil we have Brazil already 14 percent equivalent to 14

00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:07.600
 percent territory will see how indigenous reservation

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.490
 and it’s a controversial thing for you to discuss, right?

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:17.860
 on that subject but 14 percent equates to an area the size of the Southeast region

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:23.199
 Imagine São Paulo for less than one posting little Minas Espírito Santo and

00:09:23.199 --> 00:09:27.940
 Rio de Janeiro for less well less here I think it doesn’t have a million

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:33.100
 indigenist in Brazil and 1 million I think it's a wall here that is worth the

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:37.630
 municipality size of Jundiaí a little bit more my Campina house by

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:41.350
 more than a million inhabitants for all that, stay there that increased to

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:45.250
 twenty percent with some countries eating the world so you wish i think you

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:49.540
 simply going to make Brazil's agribusiness feasible we have contact with

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.959
 another thing also looks at the northern Indians of the state of Mato Grosso to

00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:58.540
 these They are in a similar situation to our plantation already cultivating 12

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:03.550
 thousand hectares of soy President has a Millionaire fine in the past because it was

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:07.610
 planting transgenic is the guy wants to talk but he believes

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:12.380
 and what happened to this story of the transgenic man’s farms

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:17.810
 white neighbors to indigenous land all with transgenics from the fence to here Only

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.230
 because the indigenous land cannot use transgenic, or be something totally

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:25.940
 ideological because or transgenic is bad and then no one can neither an Indian nor the

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.350
 white or transgenic has no problem and everyone can why the man

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:35.000
 white people can and the indigenous people cannot discriminate that makes no sense and

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.470
 something else, right, that in fact the large indigenous reserves can speak in the

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:46.160
 sea ​​fox Serra do sol among others the areas that is almost impossible ours right

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:52.959
 inspected so it operates inside it is inhumane they you are also theft of

00:10:52.959 --> 00:11:00.230
 biodiversity exploitation there predatory of the natural resources that exist there is the

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:07.070
 gold and other types of ore So this is help it’s really stealing

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:10.350
 an equity and I would like some

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:13.860
 in the second is already evolving he could already have more Freedom just from

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:18.089
 your land what you said now why am I going to make it here you can use your

00:11:18.089 --> 00:11:23.940
 the earth is in the rational way and you, as a harpsichord, can do absolutely nothing

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:28.710
 we have a project in Brasília was born in the ministry of mines and energy giving

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:32.760
 powers to the Indian if he wants to be able to explore his land as well as the

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:38.130
 white man not doing me on the side Or does and when is it you speak well is

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:42.870
 exploring means that the Indian being able to perform these actions he will follow the

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:48.330
 same environmental rules as anyone is not a white man from another

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:53.190
 other regions follows ie environmental care licensing is not a

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:56.730
 released general it will do things right now it prohibits everything and

00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:01.020
 absolutely is an invitation to illegality that the subject will not spend the rest of

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.630
 life pretending you can't do anything on his Earth

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:08.580
 thank you so much for Ricardo Salles

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:11.220
 person here who will answer the Young Pan questions in a little while this

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:15.750
 my life so here for example the internet I defend the internet book right

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:19.680
 I doubt that there is anyone who gets beaten up on the internet more than I doubt it Ah

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:25.530
 but even so I defend the free internet today a note circulated there notes

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:32.070
 on the internet that the minister makes the Health mistake he would have in Vila Nova

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:36.990
 ordinance facilitated abortion the first thing nobody can facilitate abortion right

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:43.530
 a good one until polishing I jumped I don't know three cars some more accusation is that

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:49.590
 left it there to type for legal abortion to be done in the legal cases that exist

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:54.840
 provided for by law, it is within it, failing to demand in one of the stages the

00:12:54.840 --> 00:13:00.390
 ultrasound and I went to see the new ordinance is very clear here in article 7 right

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:06.360
 and in the other holography my daughter here in article 2 here in the second phase he

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:10.380
 said of ultrasound in understanding when people invent these things and in

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:15.780
 touching also saying that he had released from the mandatory to inform

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.800
 the police authority that is here in article 7, item 1, communicate the fact to the

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:25.880
 responsible police authority Hi all right Here is the is up to that person

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.880
 do not go at once believing in anything is understanding Give a

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:34.820
 researched right it has to do here if there was a story hitting this fake News

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:39.020
 this false information and she feels the ordinance I feel right is only on the internet

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:43.730
 you take a look or see it open here is missing a lot speaking the truth

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:47.810
 on matters take the concierge take a look put on the screen and see her articles

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:53.240
 credit you have to be there and PSOL gives some publicity this is it

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:58.490
 outspoken trying to always disqualify the government you and even accuses me I don't

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:04.010
 I have to know I do not know how many ordinances per year you have already

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:08.750
 downloaded there right You must know everything that happens in the Ministries obviously something

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:11.710
 if something absurd happens we get in touch with me and often

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:15.890
 Fluminense takes a lot in the back too you want to work has already happened in

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:19.750
 health the second time with the Brazilian minister

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:31.990
 and now I’ve taken the ball on the coast too seriously I don’t want to talk too much

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:37.210
 here to make room for young people in the bathroom to meet, okay I

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:46.150
 said in my UN speech that I total emergency aid right

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:51.850
 for the next $ 1000 in fact 960 loves it was not enough to hit line

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:57.560
 now I just know how to simply divide the volume, right

00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:03.200
 and by the hair by the quantity and you have the number now you have to understand a lot

00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:08.060
 65 million people who received emergency aid and $ 600

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:12.890
 that there are five first appearing real intentions, right, we have 12 million there

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:17.900
 of ladies with children So this one received twice as much and that takes Amélia

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:25.190
 to surroundings Av do Contorno c970 960/970 I love it so I approached it was

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:31.130
 enough for lefty to accuse me of being a liar he doesn't speak look it wasn't a thousand

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:38.839
 it was 960 thanks thanks your obligation some write there wise is money wow

00:15:38.839 --> 00:15:43.640
 in the tax it is stored there in the safe that keeps the indebtedness in Costa

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:48.500
 that we did not reduce you will not have that reduced it is a lie to talk that reduced it

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:54.139
 was created by law for 3 months I already allow myself by decree

00:15:54.139 --> 00:15:58.920
 renovate we renovate for two more then it is Economic arrives and says like this then

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:03.209
 almost 50 know a month and the world has recognized that of the countries that

00:16:03.209 --> 00:16:07.079
 faced the crisis these measures were the most efficient book was not

00:16:07.079 --> 00:16:11.790
 just emergency aid afterwards we continued it was not a decree but it was for

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:18.089
 law for 300 gas has decreased a lot I know this is very little I know it is little

00:16:18.089 --> 00:16:24.059
 now for those who are paying, right in this case Brazil is a lot because we are going to

00:16:24.059 --> 00:16:28.800
 giving and when you divide if you have to pay in the future you have to pay with

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:34.379
 interest paid with this moletta thank god i fell in love that it’s down there so it’s

00:16:34.379 --> 00:16:40.800
 a course in the total pandemic will come close not to be labeled a liar is

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:45.329
 that speaks 970 huh let's say i'm lying next trillion from behind none

00:16:45.329 --> 00:16:49.350
 country in the world did it was not just an emergency aid it was Socorro a Micro

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:55.170
 and Small Businesses and it was money for states and municipalities

00:16:55.170 --> 00:17:03.250
 compensate the non-collection of ICMS and ISS So for a few days executive with

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:08.800
 the president of the hotel and restaurant bar association, right, he back there

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.610
 we approached the gate of my car the official government car I took to speak to

00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:18.579
 o Paulo Guedes a relief plan was also made for hotel staff and

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:25.630
 Bars they recurrence them the aid that the government gave otherwise if not

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:29.410
 hundreds of thousands unemployed in Brazil the hotels reached 0

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:34.270
 practically introduces you, that there are national parks in Brazil, I think that

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:38.020
 you solve some of them parts is one that closes all parents and now it's already

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:42.310
 all there masses of unemployed would be I wouldn’t even come here if I hadn’t

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:46.810
 Brazil was also taken as the country that best treated this collection in the part

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:51.080
 On the sanitary side make it very clear that the Federal Supreme Court

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:56.659
 and it was seen, right? And who should deal with this matter of restrictive measure were the

00:17:56.659 --> 00:18:01.210
 respective governors and mayors so did the federal government

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:06.380
 basically, right, it was used to send resources to the municipality and neither did I

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:12.440
 so that contaminated personnel over the school could be attended to and left the

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:18.890
 Of course also in almost everything I said in the past I said it because I didn't

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:25.159
 could take action happens now ok a lot already say that the economy

00:18:25.159 --> 00:18:30.559
 it really couldn't be achieved as it was in the past because that little story

00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:35.240
 stay at home the economy is afterwards so see here because the economy suffered

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:39.260
 something now if it hadn’t taken action the boat would be much bigger

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:46.010
 Maybe if Brazil had returned there facing chaotic situations, right?

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:53.040
 the question of the fairy that is so talked about, I'm here now that it comes to

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:59.160
 conclusion here some studies already and and by experience proof right And that is just

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:03.030
 that I had really saved seeing can one know the building she works for

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:08.790
 of the Republic more than 200 took mine believe almost all the information that

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:12.690
 I have, right, cosmetics from the presidency were consulted that Mestre

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:17.670
 installed is just for me to learn also presidential staff taken me here and

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:23.070
 no one has even been hospitalized so it’s something that the observation gave

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:27.000
 right now comes that story from the past has no scientific proof

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.730
 it was from there ok life hours from there again right that there was no alternative not to

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:38.220
 yes alternative take only that not worked who did not and according

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:43.200
 with age according to mobility did not take in the initial stage were

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:48.260
 hospitalized but the base another unfortunately there losing their lives

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:54.080
 and you were contaminated not yours in the few minutes that I didn’t have I’m going

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:57.820
 not play plague but you will get it I'll get it if you haven't already

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:03.590
 Sometimes the exam doesn’t remove Brasilia, I can’t say anything here louder

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:08.930
 Summit of power in Brasilia some executives of the Judiciary quite then

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:13.700
 also with a mask 24 she could sleep and with the lengths to

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:21.920
 but now it’s no use that I used to say back there, take care

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:27.730
 who has humidity expecting a vaccine expecting a proven remedy

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:32.870
 scientifically right, but it’s no use, it’s going to end up getting and staying at home

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:36.500
 solves nothing because when you will one day get out of the hole you will have to leave

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:40.970
 of the den and leave home and will end up getting viruses Now How to face the

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:46.130
 virus with his vitamin remembers when asking Paulo Guedes to reset a post

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:51.740
 here you see it was practiced there it feels is President Jair bolsonaro

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:58.320
 The vitamin D tax mayor governors some forbidden are only for

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:03.809
 the beach I think vitamin D you get that there in the sun taking the sun you know

00:21:03.809 --> 00:21:09.450
 it is in a way for free you get it looks like they did it all wrong and viruses

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:14.850
 after that was right he took the collection back to school now below 40

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:23.429
 years the chance of getting the virus is not there for everyone but an amount one

00:21:23.429 --> 00:21:30.690
 huge percentage, you know, it doesn’t reach people or even that little gripeze and she

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:35.790
 catch that was so criticized also gripezinha da terra and the classes have to

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:40.200
 back problems we are text we are having at home right in Europe for

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.900
 present example that the one foot tire in Europe people are going out on the streets

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:47.550
 demanding several republic measures at home until when since from

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:51.640
 now in that the tambourine Escola Naval and Academia da

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:59.710
 Force didn't close their doors all who didn't have classes all the time

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:03.790
 closed the Federal Police Academy, we also opened that other month, right?

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:08.230
 left, you can see all of this little boy, he doesn't stay at home, we left, went back to

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:13.720
 Federal Highway Police classes are also including new candidates are

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:18.010
 Santa Catarina Federal Highway Police Academy

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:21.280
 problem We are giving a problem at Colégio Militar because there is a lot

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:27.220
 teacher and civilians are unionized an enormous pressure to continue staying in

00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:35.530
 home is politicization asleep and what will happen not long that the person

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:42.220
 to be cowed is that I say who has a community who has an advanced age is

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:45.190
 be careful waiting for a possible vaccine

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:50.830
 it's a selfie, then take a vaccine and be calm if you see the virus getting there at

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:57.310
 right then so it is a reality that unfortunately a politicization of the virus I

00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:02.350
 I was slaughtered for some time before this part of us, right, this dear

00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:07.930
 Brazilian press that ties right Much more misinformation There's a saying already

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:12.370
 this video, right, and if you

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:19.440
 and don't read the newspaper you're not informed if you read you know unformed

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:24.610
 logically there is the press screen lakes one is even transmitting a signal

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:30.940
 here I always see for the for the impartiality is more others have turned

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:36.790
 a fourth fifth by gave the first power up and they play heavy on these people

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:43.150
 trying to destabilize the government I’m going to go back there Oops Amazon our

00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:47.920
 Fernando feeding forecast shirt this year and she either was not voted

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:54.550
 it was about land tenure regularization where you could then make the

00:23:54.550 --> 00:24:00.309
 people who live in Brazil all who have land ownership right she came to

00:24:00.309 --> 00:24:06.910
 be is defined for the withdrawal of payment payment remote food and of

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:11.170
 way if we were up to the future is to figure this out a fire outbreak had

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:14.179
 how to go on the property at home see if it's a bonfire São João

00:24:14.179 --> 00:24:20.450
 you know if today the area that is allowed to be planted is on fire and in terms of

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:25.190
 deforestation also if you take into account the last 20 years, right?

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:29.120
 information that arrived via deforestation media in the Amazon is no longer

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:33.440
 Amazon forest has already been deforested twice the Amazon region so what remains

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:38.690
 for us it is often a means for you to have the truth the true information

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:43.970
 right and within the Ministry itself people who have this commitment to

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:48.110
 tell the truth to see what's going on now let me go there

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:54.470
 Brazil is the country that most preserves its forests in the world here we have

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:59.330
 riparian forest in Europe has forest Will the legislation of the area of

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:03.559
 permanent preservation in Europe will have a problem that the properties are almost

00:25:03.559 --> 00:25:06.799
 all of them are very built regions at the edge of the watercourse

00:25:06.799 --> 00:25:11.450
 inn on the riverside and everything here in Brazil has a legal reserve has an app

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:14.700
 a lot that occurs protect you that the farmer in general

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:19.590
 there are specific problems, but in general it is agriculture, which is the great

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:22.830
 defender of the environment environmental problem is in the city your problem

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:27.720
 Urban is the lack of sanitation that you are, in fact, finally for Brazil

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:32.250
 sanctioned the legal framework of sanitation a country that has 100 million people in

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:37.620
 sewage treatment 35 million without even drinking water and you touched on the

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:41.910
 Amazon subject Remembering that many here before me received

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:46.140
 international awards have traveled the world being recognized as major

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:50.880
 but left 23 million Brazilians behind in the Amazon

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:55.290
 richest region in Brazil with the worst human development index worst

00:25:55.290 --> 00:26:00.809
 sanitation worse education worse health worse housing worse Everything That is, the class was

00:26:00.809 --> 00:26:04.610
 winning International trophy and left the Brazilian population behind

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:09.340
 one thing what it really is

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:14.080
 it is but i'm music if you see worry there is a country offering a few million

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:19.630
 doses for people For reforestation and have a clash with me last year I

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:24.070
 I didn’t accept this because the exchange is lost the part of the sovereignty over the

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:27.310
 Amazon Region now because these countries instead of money for our

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:29.630
 sheet just because it doesn't recognize their countries

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:35.840
 and speaks a lot, it doesn't even have 10 percent vegetation cover, we have 66 percent

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:40.700
 on the Brazilian average 84 percent of the Amazon and no one can accuse you

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:45.590
 of this irrational thing to defend patriotisms that has no justification

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:49.750
 because the Lord approved the adoption of a park for example that this partnership of

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:56.450
 132 conservation units that anyone from an international film actor to

00:26:56.450 --> 00:27:00.620
 another the funny guy explain saying things from the Amazon can put your hand

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:04.340
 in my pocket to help us take care now who only talks and don’t put money

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:11.240
 loses the legitimacy to criticize come on when there is a little time right the government

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:18.170
 American wanted to surcharge our bond and this impasse lasted there practically 30

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:23.020
 days and the company right social life hitting on

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:27.880
 look at me the guy there says he is a friend of the trump but he is doing a bad thing that

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:35.610
 Brazil took 30 days we decided on the other on the rate on ours so now

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:41.320
 woke up the commercial doesn't know that parents play hard touching and you are not to blame

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:45.400
 often from agreements signed in the past that you have fulfilled But everything

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:52.780
 well Ready to hear the week the announcement by the American government that it will import North

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:59.320
 of us, you know, an additional quota of 80 thousand tons of sugar would be welcome until

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:04.360
 because we have an overproduction of ethanol our reservoirs are not

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:09.790
 there with its maximum capacity, because the consumption of

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:13.570
 fuel among them ethanol at the time of the pandemic is still a little

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:18.919
 below normal and we have a super harvest of sugarcane ahead

00:28:18.919 --> 00:28:23.809
 good so look even if you don't make ethanol you make sugar you can throw

00:28:23.809 --> 00:28:30.559
 So this 80 thousand tons of the American government that will import from Brazil I

00:28:30.559 --> 00:28:36.259
 I’m going to talk exclusively about the Northeast region So that’s it It’s welcome

00:28:36.259 --> 00:28:41.299
 Of course, the trade balance represents very little, but it is welcome

00:28:41.299 --> 00:28:45.799
 a sign for those who seek like all the time we do have a good

00:28:45.799 --> 00:28:49.940
 launch in the United States and as far as possible we seek to improve

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:57.249
 our environment is of business President a word there that allows me for the

00:28:57.249 --> 00:29:02.450
 people from the sugar cane sector, you support your government a lot with

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:08.690
 reason right We have ethanol as an example of renewable fuel

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:12.590
 renewable for the world In fact when people talk about electric cars in the rest

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:16.909
 the world forgets that the truly sustainable car is the car

00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:22.620
 Brazilian Flex hybrid that mixes e and ethanol outside the Lithium battery

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:26.580
 that you use afterwards cannot recycle and the electric car out there in general is

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:31.380
 fueled with coal and electric internal gas here not our car has the

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:36.060
 ethanol has the ethanol you plant it captures carbon it turns into biomass afterwards

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:39.420
 to generate energy and you have given all the support to the sector

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:45.810
 then the entire surgery and with all the ills is the emission of

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:53.850
 carbon in Brazil as a percentage of the emitted in the world Complete Brazil

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:59.010
 present the migrant because they are the construction of the text We are not the villains of

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:02.910
 greenhouse gas emissions in the world, that is, this discussion of climate change

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:07.560
 it is the fault of the developed countries that in the Industrial Revolution they cut

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:12.570
 their forests used wood for coal locomotive for sleeper from

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:17.430
 railway continue to burn fossil fuel while ours in general is

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:22.060
 ethanol Our energy is right and hydraulic is Lika is

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:28.060
 photovoltaic that that solar is biomass We are not responsible for the

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:32.680
 emissions in the world we have commitments to make but no one can even enjoy the

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:37.750
 Brazil this responsibility we are three percent the only for me to have a

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:42.490
 idea a question of comparison all Latin America together all inclusive

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:48.520
 Brazil represents seventeen percent of what I only found on my own if you

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:52.150
 I am more United States Europe much more than Brazil then and the countries

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:56.140
 you know then you need to put things in their right place we are not villains

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:59.650
 of the climate issue at all so the Brazilians who are in the

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:07.420
 internet before that was I’m suggest ask for information before criticizing is

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:12.340
 criticize all the time with their famous villains in the world in this issue of emission

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:16.720
 of CO2 and we are down there even for the size of Brazil you very 500

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:21.830
 territorial extension your life even right the territorial extension and we are one of

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:26.899
 latest CO2 emissions so Brazil does its part now it is not together with its

00:31:26.899 --> 00:31:31.249
 critical because with your criticism you do because more and more information

00:31:31.249 --> 00:31:36.850
 fans goes outside of Brazil and from there

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:42.100
 what is the consequence of this are actually campaign out there to boycott product

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:46.150
 Brazilian made even by idiots a Brazilian just made the guy very

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:49.750
 known does not speak the name of not believing problem is that I speaking no

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:54.670
 buying in Brazil is now a guy who doesn't really have a very good life right

00:31:54.670 --> 00:32:01.929
 and live as if he were a maharajah live in the world of the moon as a tycoon training a

00:32:01.929 --> 00:32:07.090
 it happen now you humble without hunger better where to stay is simply

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:11.830
 relaying sharing the liars Mateus about our Brazil I said

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:15.790
 for you you catch over the past 20 years that everyone has caught fire in

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:19.390
 some Amazon region and in the Pantanal rarely the year that doesn’t take what doesn’t

00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:24.429
 caught fire there you are going to count all the areas announced The fires you have already

00:32:24.429 --> 00:32:28.570
 burned the sea is the size of Brazil number

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:33.190
 calls it week the visit of the American secretary Mike Pompeo had a

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:38.940
 I sent our Minister of Foreign Affairs Renato Araújo over there

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:44.860
 as well as a defense representative from where the army forgot his name

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:49.750
 here also accompanied the manager of Roraima And of course he went to see her

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:53.320
 question of the welcomed operation does not think that the American has an interest in

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:57.940
 reestablish democracy in Venezuela now I will not speak one of the country either

00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:02.409
 there is another country here in South America but in the south that you are buying for

00:33:02.409 --> 00:33:10.029
 where are they going by the wrong option?

00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:16.840
 already demonstrated in the past and follow the São Paulo forum line and now the

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:23.019
 having a mistaken vote there was even very angry made the left

00:33:23.019 --> 00:33:28.550
 responsible for success in that country came back to power and quickly and

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:34.820
 you can see the regime similar to ours in Venezuela ending right look

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:43.760
 here you’re playing ball in my head okay it’s circulated a lot this is it and

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:49.820
 freedom of speech now if it were the opposite it would be passive fake news of

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:55.730
 passive to revoke the arrest warrant and seta has no one more than me who

00:33:55.730 --> 00:34:00.450
 suffers fake News in Brazil and suffered during the elections

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:06.330
 the accused all the time and racist homophobic fascist misogynist does not like

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:13.230
 northeastern and has a process in the TSE to remove my plate right as if I had

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:17.580
 been elected by fake News I ask any of you who received any

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:24.090
 your phone that you didn’t know origin is the fruit of the boosting fruit and made

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:28.590
 you change the vote has not received anything until today information from anyone who received

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:34.590
 in operation someone received the cell phone here to speak

00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:40.350
 on elections could change your vote right from the duty to vote in the PT vote in the

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:44.640
 third and did not have and unfortunately has a process until the third gives

00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:48.690
 to play this process I am absolutely sure here will be filed in that

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:54.240
 right, even for the sake of justice We will not have a vote for that

00:34:54.240 --> 00:35:00.070
 that I'm sure of that go to the TSE and everyone is aware of what happens

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:04.900
 in municipal elections in São Paulo do not know how to say that you must have a

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:08.410
 candidate is already talking there but I will not speak the name help us too but I

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:12.070
 I have a jacket with but I will not say his name ok you have to help

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:16.540
 thinking also I will not talk about one of them and there is also a candidate in Manaus not

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:22.630
 I will speak his name right and obviously if you vote needy little bee and want

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:26.230
 you already know who to vote for in São Paulo who are talking, you know you were going

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:34.140
 put São Paulo later you will find me here for you You will like him

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:44.080
 however he is a person that I know everybody, right? And I hope he grows up and

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:47.200
 research was the child for us to learn an audience in Manaus we have a

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:51.520
 excellent candidate there and the but I make your commitment not alive not

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:57.260
 enter into municipal ones Although, and we can change our mind too

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:03.829
 right and because if it reaches such a point and I think I can influence the

00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:09.319
 elections in these three, right, three cities, I will speak out because I think

00:36:09.319 --> 00:36:15.799
 this candidate our seeing is has everything to make a good mandate for the

00:36:15.799 --> 00:36:19.950
 well from São Paulo de Santos or Manaus AM

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:24.890
 is well the young man we plant the screen is in the air here

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:31.590
 pingo nos is on Facebook YouTube is not with 32 thousand people online pingo nos

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:38.940
 is 82.000 Jovem Pan 9000 then 91.000 Jovem Pan left us in the dust

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:42.720
 I recommend you when you're done with the Live scale here Sintonia Jovem Pan

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:48.930
 symbol Zinho to watch there Augusto Nunes is on vacation Victor grade if he uses

00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:58.280
 and Samaria ok will stay to see the question are you

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:04.040
 I will ask the question here is it accumulated because of the pandemic is almost

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:11.150
 40 ambassador nominations around the world are approved and we are for Israel is

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:17.090
 a huge meandering army general was going there Okay, he made a contact with the

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:21.140
 during that time practically all the governors with practically all the

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:24.980
 senators then sought from the authorities that he would like

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:29.960
 Ambassador to do there on my part I told him that there was already

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:34.940
 talked to Benjamin Nathaniel by coincidence

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:41.240
 with I found him Colonel of the Israeli army who is Ambassador here in

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:46.580
 Brazil that I would like to see done, among other things, something like

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:50.480
 the Rondon project in the past our kids went to Israel to stay there

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:57.640
 average 30 days of the clerk for free the only requirement is that we speak in English

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:02.470
 the scene is in no condition Send someone to say that I don't speak English is today in

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:06.880
 almost unacceptable day in someone who does not speak another language for your

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:12.069
 own well and for your own professionalization to see the

00:38:12.069 --> 00:38:18.970
 fish farming in the desert see how it works agriculture la la la la it rains

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:23.890
 less than ours our carille our sertão and how does it work there the

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:27.549
 Culture how do you get them beyond the food guarantee and not support

00:38:27.549 --> 00:38:33.339
 part is for Europe starting the technology too so this is the General

00:38:33.339 --> 00:38:38.200
 getting there already has carte blanche to get to Israel go to club

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:42.190
 sense for us to do something similar to the project go to send Our

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:47.529
 kids at university in Brazil all free of charge to do an internship there in

00:38:47.529 --> 00:38:56.380
 exam Because it is a good problem program there is an example video let's go Ask if

00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:58.980
 use with the word

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:03.330
 So [Music]

00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:09.570
 conditioning good night is in your opinion What are the three

00:39:09.570 --> 00:39:15.890
 main lies spread today about the Amazon in the world thank you

00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:21.680
 the rain can name several but first is the following that the amazon

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:26.809
 dismantling the Environmental Protection system is not true when

00:39:26.809 --> 00:39:31.160
 otherwise we receive ourselves and that we receive the Protection system

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:35.390
 Environment to care for the Amazon dismantled Half of the staff

00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:39.799
 bank employees you saw me for example it was lacking investment

00:39:39.799 --> 00:39:44.180
 budget and strategy the first thing according to people say look

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:48.829
 you are imposing the population of the Amazon the model that they do not want

00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:53.210
 it is not true as president today quoted here several indigenous lands the

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:58.700
 cinta-largas in Rondônia the Parecis in Mato Grosso Caiapós munduruku there in Pará

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:03.079
 where we had an operation recently several of them want many

00:40:03.079 --> 00:40:07.160
 is to work with agriculture others to have some degree of exploitation of their

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:11.599
 mineral wealth is the greatest in Brazil so it is not true that we are

00:40:11.599 --> 00:40:15.900
 a point we are present has said have to respect what people want

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:19.559
 the places that a big lie that’s said there is that the amazon is being

00:40:19.559 --> 00:40:24.869
 devastated now we have 84 percent of the Amazon preserved since the

00:40:24.869 --> 00:40:30.329
 the Portuguese arrived here today 84 everyone who lives in the Amazon person

00:40:30.329 --> 00:40:34.829
 think the Amazon an empty place has 23 million Brazilians there is not the

00:40:34.829 --> 00:40:39.510
 empty place people need to produce need to live need to get around and

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:44.910
 still 84 percent is preserved What you need in the Amazon is

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:49.710
 sustainable economic development that As our Paulo Guedes said in the

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:54.359
 President still out there has no worse enemy for the environment than

00:40:54.359 --> 00:41:00.180
 poverty EA Amazonia has been left in poverty the richest people in the world are in

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:06.450
 Roraima you find a periodic table right under the ground no

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:09.710
 thing is not underground because the gas is very clear he

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:15.410
 the greedy EA is there these great the Band were not demarcated it was not

00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:20.990
 coincidence right is where in the subsoil there are immeasurable riches like the region

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:26.150
 of the six lakes for example the start also doesn’t stop is an area back there

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:32.869
 for Pedro Figueiredo's decree has been safeguarded for a possible

00:41:32.869 --> 00:41:39.290
 decoration in the future was almost handed over to other companies that would

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:46.010
 just for that region and so that good time and the operation was suspended and we

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:51.200
 we wait for an opportune moment to see how to explore this and we have a project

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:56.690
 As I said at the beginning now wires here allowed exploration, right, the mining in

00:41:56.690 --> 00:42:01.580
 indigenous lands That's it, it's not going to authorize just to update but it has

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:06.859
 to have here the science of the Indian for such now while you do it the

00:42:06.859 --> 00:42:13.170
 irrational exploitation is happening right and we send it out

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:18.090
 large amount of Gold lover among other ores is number another

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:24.120
 question is Zé Maria and

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:29.640
 It is but not very good night President Jair bolsonaro good night tells me Ricardo

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:34.860
 Salles happy I would like you to talk about what Brazil can do what

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:40.560
 can be done to recover Brazil's image in this war for the labor market

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:46.560
 agribusiness right and more what is the origin of these attacks of all is

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:50.800
 resistant Brazilians cheering against the country Felício

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:55.630
 ok Zé Maria I would say the following was my place is a shame we have

00:42:55.630 --> 00:43:00.070
 Brazilians who spoke ill of their own country here to resonate abroad

00:43:00.070 --> 00:43:05.350
 or let's go out there and speak ill of Brazil either in seminars or meetings

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:09.100
 whether in newspaper articles Whatever it is why does that happen that the

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:14.080
 president was the first president in the last decades that is taking away the right

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:18.090
 matters under the rug is amazonian politics was the ostrich policy

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:22.960
 sticking your head in the hole pretends you no longer had illegal mining in the land

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:27.520
 indigenous and no longer had theft of wood and no longer had land grabbing and for

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:31.090
 that it had all this because the people didn’t even want to discuss these issues and

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:35.110
 the president bolsonaro in a coherent and serious way is bringing these

00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:39.310
 matters to be debated in Brazil people go out there to complain that we

00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:42.910
 we also closed a lot of taps on the mouths here inside the lot of

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:46.900
 entities a lot of organizations a lot of academic do this all that

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:50.810
 it never ended, you know, but I kept taking the money from our government

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:54.740
 I will then, if it passed by the government, we need the tap, everything is ok

00:43:54.740 --> 00:44:04.590
 screaming out there is also love goes out comes out of it

00:44:04.590 --> 00:44:09.550
 the coast on Oi good night president 'good night

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:14.470
 Minister Minister in Tuesday's speech at the UN General Assembly the

00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:18.220
 president bolsonaro drew attention to this problem of the campaign of

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:23.820
 disinformation promoted against Brazil abroad and spoke about Indians and

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:29.380
 caboclos who also burn their shoes in the Amazon rainforest sir

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:33.370
 could you give us more details about that Minister for us who are here

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:37.240
 the distance following all this question of the Amazon these fires

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:42.670
 made by Indians are also illegal or in some cases they are allowed

00:44:42.670 --> 00:44:47.770
 by law and that if prohibited, the authorities are able to supervise

00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:51.760
 are able to impose fines when necessary even if they are within

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:55.570
 indigenous territories how's that like this scenario thank you good night

00:44:55.570 --> 00:45:00.270
 for us president And Vitor is what the gift sold and

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:04.980
 has every reason following a culture of fire management it is a culture that makes

00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:09.680
 part when you don’t have technology in places What’s the way to produce

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:17.070
 agriculture cuts set fire and plant until you go using one two three plantations

00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:20.910
 three times you cultivate on the fourth he changes that I small farming

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:25.830
 communities related to india also does this is part of the culture this wants to

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:29.730
 to say that any burning that has in the Indian Amazon the caboclo Of course not

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:33.450
 that is not what the president meant but he meant that it is part of the culture

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:38.400
 the fire involved in the production, which is even made with

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:43.740
 low-tech places in Brazil where high technology is employed you don't
