00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.199
it's good

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.020
 it was more the same

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:25.880
 it's good night on thursday 8 august 2009 19 hours in brasília

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.300
 to my left that elisângela our eternal pound girls on the right

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.100
 china already talked to fener morro will talk a little bit about the anti crime project

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.230
 of him was voted in the second round of pension reform in the chamber follows

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.489
 to the senate so it's our interest is more attention is

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:54.320
 the chamber initially would like the chamber to vote and discussion and vote the

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:02.000
 crime project that gold will speak of its importance and its need

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.600
 we really hope this goes forward come on we have actions today

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.280
 what I most importantly is not getting the final numbers to the question

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.820
 of those who robbed him of 700 kilos of gold são paulo

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.560
 so we come to an approximate number is not the real yet of how many people are in charge

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.980
 of gold officially out of Brazil while staying here and talk a little bit

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:32.440
 of that proposal to legalize me gold mining companies come here take it out and

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.040
 tons and tons of gold a share there close to 10 percent a little bit

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.090
 below 10% is taxed and when it comes to legalizing gold mining

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.150
 there are a lot of people who are against it so let's start discussing this matter for you

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:57.920
 until you have numbers and data on how you better decide if you think

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:05.960
 we should not do is open legal mining here in Brazil we have three young Indians

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.940
 here from the raposa serra do sol indigenous reserve they will say something about the

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:19.819
 yesterday, the 165th anniversary of the holy house of judge was celebrated here

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:26.049
 from outside who was born again [Laughter]

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:31.940
 we talked a few elections the role of the left here

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.860
 who had talked to him is something cool, I live here is the person

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.090
 who acted with great discretion and responsibility in everything he did in his

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.860
 special life the squid's judgment that he thinks the squid is innocent

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.990
 he says it is petrobras's what happened to it almost broke

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.060
 only that of the personnel sheet

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.060
 almost half a trillion reais from the bds that left

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.380
 dictatorships from all over the world by friends here inside the king and to other friends too

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.090
 very private as some found a small plane paying 46 for

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:20.580
 percent interest with hi which is a shame 10 4% in a year after then the

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.970
 holy house my thanks to the professionals

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.940
 doctors and less staff for the way they treat and save my

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.950
 life there in judge outside so much is that I consider myself a miner also after the world

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.410
 here will sit on the side here health is a little bit of an environmental issue

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.000
 he had a nice time yesterday yesterday I spent a lot of time there

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.370
 divergent have a lot of fun there congratulations on the answer you gave to

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:59.430
 questions and elegant they asked you are I live here the last subject there I

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.600
 a show is a great meeting in São Paulo of internet users to the gamers that I

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.860
 I saw on my facebook page, the people talking are very high the impulse of

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.690
 electronic games look for the IRS and I saw that it really is high

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.060
 tax I tried to talk to Paulo guess

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.770
 I talked to Marcos Cintra of the possibility to lower the tax if

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.400
 could decrease are legally can be very simple

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.710
 now I can't now at that moment it gives a bigger decrease than ours

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.990
 to be able to change the tax on games today would still be between 20 and 50 per

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.969
 percent and the proposal our revenue go from 15 to 40

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:47.519
 is a reduction that is equivalent to more or less 50 million less than the collection of

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:52.829
 money that stays with the Brazilian people, not with the economy

00:04:52.829 --> 00:04:58.439
 I understand that if this tax dimension is to accompany due to the reduction in the price to

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:02.189
 that more people will ultimately find quality because it is something not

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:06.089
 understand very very similar there are a lot of people talking also there in

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:12.209
 same size internet of musical material musical instruments

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:16.799
 I haven't seen it yet because Paulo Guerra went to Rio earlier

00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:20.039
 Marcos still went to have a surgery in São Paulo next week, you will see that

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:24.869
 can also signal in this sense now a major tax reform that

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:29.069
 ahead of us is that these issues will all be dealt with in a

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:37.610
 sorry that it’s not much reduction but it’s a signage morro da boa vista rua

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:44.939
 minister in court the defendant only lets me talk my teenage son will be happy there

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:55.979
 with the reduction of polycarbonate vinícius vereza hug and congratulations on the pec

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:01.079
 a wonderful job still does and he came to brasilia

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:05.610
 logically it is a different thing to work here in the executive branch

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.389
 we depend to a great extent on the legislative power

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:15.929
 his dream when giving up 22 years of magistracy is to improve himself in

00:06:15.929 --> 00:06:20.009
 fighting organized crime fighting corruption and laundering

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:25.169
 of money and is also in his misery of justice and public security

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:31.909
 so a lot is to go there so there's a project like six months

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:39.149
 on camera and he would like to say something that in short is your project and

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:43.409
 what can we do to get it voted

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:50.280
 we are grateful for the opportunity the government presented solid projects

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.280
 the new social security project that was approved now in the first round at

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.530
 chamber that needs to resume employment economics but people also clamor for

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:03.780
 more security for fewer crimes safe squares on the street and the

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.550
 ministry supported by the government of the lord has

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.810
 worked on this line there has even been a significant reduction in lenses

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.460
 criminals that later are still high I think they will work harder but we

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.690
 we have advanced in statistics point out not only government statistics

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:26.430
 but even to organizations that are not very sympathetic government points to a drop

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:33.060
 25 percent in Tokyo in 20 percent of that Syrian film this year in

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:39.590
 compared to the same period last year for example the fact that the pcc dome

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:46.979
 left são paulo and went to parts of rondônia as well as the chief of the tc was also

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:50.160
 will certainly meet helped to reduce violence in Brazil

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.390
 certainly that much of the violence linked to organized crime when it comes to

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:58.620
 isolates in leadership and takes away the leadership ability and transmitting orders to

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:03.419
 its soldiers on the outside this greatly impacts the efficiency of organized crime

00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:06.690
 and reducing crime is not the only factor, but it is certainly

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:11.370
 this contributed and they were there for 12 years in the should have been treated a long time ago

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:17.760
 time ago we did this with the support of the lord in February together wide

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.539
 são paulo this was important for the time that the

00:08:21.539 --> 00:08:25.950
 secrecy was maintained from planning to completion of the mission

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:31.440
 sinsheim was absolutely absolutely secretive and let's tackle had support from

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:37.169
 armed forces had the support of several organs of the Ministry of Justice then

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:42.000
 works really well and the transfer was the decision was a government decision

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.800
 federal government together with the state government it was important to support the

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.770
 to do this operation, otherwise I wouldn't do it, it's a decision

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:54.270
 strategic humor the very emblematic case ok i have a project

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:59.370
 to combat crime, right, even the case happened in mines

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:05.620
 general is known as case care that that is it everybody knows that

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:13.540
 this one didn’t care that it’s no longer your brother-in-law but there’s a lady in the room and

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:19.509
 a thug came into the room and fired and hit two or three shots in the

00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:24.850
 woman accepted and then the forgiveness of the rhyme manages to get into a physical fight with

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:29.589
 this thug rolling on the floor and he ends up with the [ __ ]'s water three shots

00:09:29.589 --> 00:09:34.290
 on the head on the marginal well what happens

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:40.959
 is that it was in my thesis is that there were 10 there is no problem then in your project

00:09:40.959 --> 00:09:48.610
 whole you so let's go is not having a project says it takes off

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:55.149
 the figure of the excess of questions once, even yours from your project that

00:09:55.149 --> 00:09:58.930
 there is the question of excess if it transforms into law today

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:03.730
 that would benefit from it, the sister would benefit, it must be understood that

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:08.019
 people are not exactly margins so when someone attacked how was it

00:10:08.019 --> 00:10:12.730
 this case is precisely the person reacting and eventually there may even be some

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:16.630
 excess but the person practices that excess at the moment of a certain

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.870
 out of control then it would be absolutely wrong in

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:25.810
 my opinion treating or that case the brother-in-law who just helps to protect the

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:31.300
 family as a murderer in the next and defending the family so this is a

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.600
 proposal this is a proposal is in the project has

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:39.510
 other important proposals I read your twitter today talking

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:47.500
 criticizing the possibility that a father who killed his daughter is leaving the prison

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:52.660
 those famous little sayings on Father's Day is this is something that the project

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.810
 of crime ends and has other important measures

00:10:55.810 --> 00:11:00.850
 the prediction of the second instance options the jury's court execution and has a

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:04.720
 as I think it is fundamentally present importance that I allow that

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.819
 just explain is one that says so look if you have been convicted of a crime yourself

00:11:09.819 --> 00:11:15.560
 organized to have committed the crime in a criminal version you don't have

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:20.000
 I did prison-like prison or regime progression

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.779
 as long as you remain linked to the criminal organization

00:11:23.779 --> 00:11:28.310
 what we want we want the prisoner to re-socialize and return to the citizen

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:31.490
 and don't go back to a soldier in organized crime

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:37.040
 the idea with this is that it’s not just keeping people stuck but giving up

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:42.470
 that if it stays working it will help to decrease the strength of the

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:46.490
 criminal organizations torch thus fundamental importance of reforms

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:50.089
 economic needs we also need to deal with

00:11:50.089 --> 00:11:55.400
 people's safety although we are doing this in your government is to reduce

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:58.670
 this crime rate the project acquired we will have

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:05.060
 conditions to take a leap in my opinion is no one will be able to be the

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:11.450
 violence in brazil we have to have measures to stimulate

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:15.410
 that perhaps she committed the crime and a large part of the crimes are

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.610
 premeditated the world project has this other

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:26.300
 ideas for sure can come up also have other ideas too and let's

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:31.910
 address this issue with which the speed and responsibility that

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:35.930
 we should all be waiting so long for parliament to look into this and vote

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:39.020
 vote in a vote will certainly make some

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:44.140
 alterations to be natural is a rare thing when any project reaches the chamber

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:49.820
 in the Senate as well and return to the same present for sanction or veto without

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:53.750
 changes we respect the lack of the camera

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:58.130
 is the hope of the so-called sensitivity of this project and it is simple

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:02.030
 allow the correction to the morumbi project government project already touched

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:07.670
 and it is a project that interests society in general, there are a lot of people within the

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:12.380
 parliament that supports this important project as well as the government

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:16.810
 federal government has given impetus i'm going to ask the economic davi the

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:22.700
 federal senate that will have a consolidated amendment proposal passed in bed to

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.520
 reduce the age of criminal responsibility for some types of crime

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:30.350
 it was not what i would like i would always spend 16 years and mobility

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:34.610
 that it would be from that age on, but the chamber voted there, right until one

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:40.640
 according to some parties that just for example drug trafficking and injury

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:46.070
 body followed by kidnapping death is that that person would be tried as

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:48.910
 adult was passed in the chamber to the senate

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:53.120
 I say it's not what I want I don't have any ancestry on the camera has

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.570
 a contact now the vote goes from the conscience or the

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:59.660
 understanding of each parliamentarian has to be respected

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:04.460
 so I hope you owe the name and ask him to put him on the agenda for the gift of the agenda

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:09.200
 senate so that the reduction of the mandate is voted there and not for this type of crime

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.920
 it’s another step that in my opinion doesn’t have a girl

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:17.480
 I think that for serious crimes here is a discussion of reducing the truth just to

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:22.400
 who assures me that by then another way of leaving the chain

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:27.770
 people have a decision now it's justice is putting on the street around

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:33.890
 400 minor offenders the mandatory presence offender you there is another name

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:40.160
 right 400 juvenile offenders on lauro streets in rio de janeiro and there is molão

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.610
 16 and 17 in three committed a crime committed a barbaric crime

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:49.190
 if that proposal has already been approved in the senate and extended by parliament

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:52.640
 these guys are not able to go to the street, this is the appeal we make when we go

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.570
 with mine i am sure he will wield this flag and to put in

00:14:56.570 --> 00:15:01.730
 vote in the senate always take the excuse right here I

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:07.130
 continued federal deputy would not be able to live outside the chamber of

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:10.910
 deputies we want is for parliament to vote and we will respect the

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:15.560
 result approving or not and period more one message sends no I go to

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:19.400
 successful shopping and change places in the field with mini skirts for matters

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.780
 is to do forced labor

00:15:24.459 --> 00:15:36.829
 thank you now your chair mark the saints welcome to alert the students

00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:42.379
 the reservoir this I’m on the cover of the globe here to anyone on the cover of

00:15:42.379 --> 00:15:48.350
 globe here of my god is the Tuesday the chainsaw captain

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:53.240
 (Laughter) I'm with the captain. Serra is the

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:57.230
 guy is passed out we ended up amazon i want to put a

00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:05.389
 amazon on the ground and if due to those in my opinion it’s unchecked right

00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:11.649
 as accurate about the deforestation of June taking into account the June

00:16:11.649 --> 00:16:16.759
 this number doesn’t look like they haven’t been checked yet

00:16:16.759 --> 00:16:22.180
 was the president's yesterday even a former president of the respected scientist inpi

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:28.579
 commented on the television program that deforestation in Brazil has been growing already

00:16:28.579 --> 00:16:34.480
 many years has been growing since 2012 started to grow faster in 2015 16

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:39.860
 17 18 and is yet to be measured in 2019

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.819
 but this measurement of deforestation has a cause

00:16:43.819 --> 00:16:50.540
 for 20 years the staff did the ostrich policy did it says that no one

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:56.029
 although in the amazon that has no more than 20 million people living there and that

00:16:56.029 --> 00:17:00.350
 need to have an economic activity to support themselves and their

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:05.510
 then pretend they don’t have agro pressure they don’t have the pressure

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:12.049
 by wood the loggers the forest management industry and also the mining

00:17:12.049 --> 00:17:15.980
 so all these people have been there for over 20 years it didn't start in your

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:20.179
 government and social problems, moreover, a very rich region, you have

00:17:20.179 --> 00:17:24.319
 that said it is a very rich region in terms of natural wealth resources

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:29.270
 poorer natural resources from the point of view of lack of infrastructure through

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:34.340
 garbage sanitation that say a lot of mineral wealth wood biodiversity

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:38.840
 but poverty for those who are there to solve this equation that you have

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.909
 faced this issue well to do newspaper you have to bring it down thanks

00:17:42.909 --> 00:17:50.330
 some a defense for example thinking about it in the preservation of the environment

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:57.679
 concerned with global warming and also inspired here by that of the chainsaw

00:17:57.679 --> 00:18:03.260
 of the globe that is not now the chainsaw was already a hundred percent being accused

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:07.399
 without the captain put on saw today is the american course that killed indian vote

00:18:07.399 --> 00:18:12.049
 in us thanks for the English

00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:16.610
 in general the course has the captain has returned to now now here you can see no one has

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:22.100
 doubt that Pope John has to take down so thinking about the environment

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.210
 perfectly in tune with the by the newspaper the globe us to see a game very

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:32.179
 thanks we take for example the newspaper economic value this week

00:18:32.179 --> 00:18:38.299
 so the week value publishes balance sheets of big companies here for

00:18:38.299 --> 00:18:47.140
 example irb free reinsurance in latin america is just a tuesday edition

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:53.960
 used 11 pages 11 pages to make the balance sheet here of the newspaper

00:18:53.960 --> 00:19:00.370
 so what to do has been a provisional measure for some time now so that irb

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:06.110
 can publish its balance sheet the official union diary in cvm or in

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:12.080
 The company's own website no longer needs to search for the newspaper with the value

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:17.899
 economic to publish weeks so how is the provisional measure the entrepreneurs

00:19:17.899 --> 00:19:22.039
 in Brazil that are required by law to publish their balance sheets in newspapers of

00:19:22.039 --> 00:19:27.799
 large circulation I no longer need to do it as a result is profit is less

00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:33.529
 company expense also this is more money from the shareholders of the companies that

00:19:33.529 --> 00:19:39.409
 produce other things there can ultimately make this product a little bit

00:19:39.409 --> 00:19:44.750
 cheaper you buy and then our intention was to cut red tape

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:49.809
 deregulated is a mayor we’re right and I’m sure the value

00:19:49.809 --> 00:19:53.770
 economic should no longer public balance sheets it will get another

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:59.290
 source for the recipe hypotension newspaper

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:04.750
 so count on hope that on the cover of the globe tomorrow I’m no longer the captain

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:08.740
 chainsaw made the captain is preserving the environment and the value

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:12.130
 economic think the newspaper o Globo the gang wanted to tighten the siege with this

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:16.000
 nickname la in bed already defended there in the senate he captain put saw

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.190
 so I'm going to save on the globe good luck then I said economic no

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:27.520
 newspaper the globe the projections do not need is that a year

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:32.980
 businessmen will stop spending, look at a year stop spending 1 billion and

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:37.780
 200 million reais with newspapers so what will be celebrated with all

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:41.380
 with all the media is that the media is also supportive and I'm sure that young people

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:49.120
 are favorable to the measure and help not deforest more to make the newspaper the

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.700
 businessman for sure they are enjoying it

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:56.530
 and there’s a detail I don’t know if it’s going to be another mp an amendment to the mp

00:20:56.530 --> 00:21:00.940
 digital oz will stay out must have been well remembered by a reporter here for

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.210
 down here now the drop was from São Paulo I am not mistaken since the

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:09.250
 notices from the city halls of the states and the union

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:18.730
 you can also publish the zero personal cost website big hug ours is this

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:22.890
 wonder that we have there thanks for the support

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:29.260
 this newspaper is the planted forest now another destination but that's it

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:33.850
 bureaucratize what Brazilian society has done well up to now

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:41.610
 society rightly applauds this is something else every year I

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:46.419
 waited for the moment to announce the anticipation of the 13th of the retired and

00:21:46.419 --> 00:21:51.220
 inss pensioners by decree so it was his will to do all

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:56.679
 a president making party 4 during his tenure four opportunities

00:21:56.679 --> 00:22:00.730
 we solved then there was the economic team

00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:05.410
 it is via a provisional measure that will occupy even with all certainty it was approved

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:11.320
 defines that every August the retiree and think about talking and know that the

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:16.299
 first installment of the anticipated the third was installed in the

00:22:16.299 --> 00:22:19.450
 bank this gives predictability of the retiree and

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:22.870
 pensioner right in addition to inject a little earlier

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:27.549
 because a few billion of the market is a little early

00:22:27.549 --> 00:22:34.049
 calm vettel would vote in favor of the deputy certainly acts at home in the mouth

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:43.540
 of the other thing, just by repeating it, we managed to increase it without

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:47.650
 decree 13 for beneficiaries of the Bolsa Família

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:53.350
 because if you increase expenses by fighting the test but the measure doesn’t quite understand

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:58.140
 the pt was in power for three years, it says that

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:02.679
 always defended the poorest, but our government here that accused them of

00:23:02.679 --> 00:23:08.049
 dictator among other things is achieved by decree so the woman being the

00:23:08.049 --> 00:23:11.110
 people who receive a scholarship went to put a family scholarship

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:16.870
 and speaking of third and vettel toccato i'm here with my corporate card

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:21.900
 see here not to take my side I'm here with my corporate card

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:29.740
 challenge to the press the globe only são paulo economic value sheet mail

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.650
 braziliense we will do a story tomorrow i will open

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:36.309
 the secrecy of my card is broken and I will open the confidentiality on the card

00:23:36.309 --> 00:23:42.280
 you take note of how much I spent from January to the end of until the

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:47.590
 end of July press press let's do a soap opera i eat and

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:51.820
 I invite you to make a story in the past about that expense that I

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:56.440
 compartmentalized January could be able to spend the bones up to 400 thousand reais per

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:00.580
 year I could spend even with that average the other two years I spent half of that

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:05.830
 accusing me is abusing spending on airfare heap of fake news stuff

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:10.600
 but they didn’t make the matter in the global expense that I had with the card is with the

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:14.420
 the camera's money the credit had could spend it didn't spend

00:24:14.420 --> 00:24:18.290
 government spending was left on the field now I liked the press that this is

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:23.240
 a story said, right, my spending on corporate cards doesn’t

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:26.600
 I will speak against the goiás and not who is challenged the press little you in the mouth

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:31.370
 of the cashier to always have step there will appear at full gas with card

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:36.320
 corporate is not in a hurry the idea of ​​them dealt showed to show

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:41.510
 people who are now accusing me of spending 26 million for 1 million a month

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:46.100
 let's discriminate here that you spent and quoted a card you don't know the

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:52.730
 true let's apply flight 8 32 else one

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:55.010
 little bit has to do with you a little bit right

00:24:55.010 --> 00:25:00.020
 is that we are all in favor of clean energy generation speaks

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:07.970
 the clean source and look at solar water even we had here the students had we had here

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:15.020
 in sobradinho in bahia visiting the hydroelectric plant of

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:22.400
 and the first set of panels was inaugurated there.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:28.720
 at the accommodation there was agreed the equivalent of one hectare

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:36.260
 detail of the detail if we were used is the whole water mirror of the whole house

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:40.910
 which is quite large the sunlight generated during the day

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:45.110
 obviously as well as can’t cash comes after no right

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:53.090
 cannot have solar energy at night is the color of the energy generated with the sun with

00:25:53.090 --> 00:26:00.380
 heat stroke 6 60 times the amount of energy generated by doubts is a

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:05.809
 pilot project of the chef for sale chef is sure that it will be

00:26:05.809 --> 00:26:09.080
 spreading something wrong all over Brazil I have the one to

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.919
 important issue that you authorized over a month ago that the

00:26:12.919 --> 00:26:16.200
 so that we can dispose of the garbage to protect it

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:20.880
 that is to say it gives another form also besides ethanol is not that the

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:25.110
 renewable energy and that brazil is an example to the world so this has been catching up

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:31.200
 the sugar and alcohol industry a lot behind the military government we didn't have the

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:35.880
 little program i think all 95 percent of cars in brazil was

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:41.850
 powered by sunday already has technology outside of brazil trucks is powered by alcohol

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:47.700
 also in simulations is with a very steep ramp

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:52.039
 canoes is something going uphill and of course it is still a prototype but

00:26:52.039 --> 00:27:00.059
 the issue of electric power for vehicles is increasingly have new

00:27:00.059 --> 00:27:04.049
 technologies in the world until that history of the government battery still comes back

00:27:04.049 --> 00:27:08.309
 is on paper but when I get off the paper I think it will be easier it will be a

00:27:08.309 --> 00:27:12.870
 reality is the great advantage of the battle defend that it can be reloaded in

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:18.240
 few seconds while separating on the road at a gas station and going

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:22.860
 have a coffee and play again to have more autonomy for 400 and 500 km

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:29.700
 obviously this is innovative is a revolution is in transport and in the world

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:35.010
 where the president is going to be launched now here in Brazil

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:41.370
 the first hybrid electric flex car is a flex ethanol car that has

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:46.620
 electric motor also has its own ethanol engine charges the battery and the battery uses

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.740
 when you are not using ethanol this is a Brazilian thing that will

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:54.570
 launch there now and that is an example of our sustainability there for the world and

00:27:54.570 --> 00:28:08.450
 formula even the formula is the formula and there are already competitions outside of brazil bring

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:14.309
 a difficult stage for us here is quite incipient yet time will

00:28:14.309 --> 00:28:20.070
 news that this can bring this to us here during the week now the

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:24.870
 telebrás announced from 11 is not the 17th does not have 11

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:30.060
 the amount of biodiesel is dissolved in the diversion

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:35.820
 it's normal that we have a large part of the best part of our

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:41.820
 soy production for biodiesel I hope here by 2026

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.820
 we managed to see 17 burn even more

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:51.870
 from there to collectives announced by minister tereza cristina a harvest

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:59.010
 record of 241 million tons of grain in the 2008 2009 harvest

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:03.750
 and then I don’t know that it’s not much of a towel, but I was left with this line about going out each

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:09.630
 increasingly happens with the chainsaw course accuses tehran of cristiane if there the lady of

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:13.290
 poison this is president nonsense because the the

00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:18.870
 the fact that brazil has approved new pesticides means that the old ones

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:22.230
 out of the market those who defend keeping the old ones instead

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:25.980
 to replace it with something more modern technology is completely unaware

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:31.680
 in fact there is a malley rule in brazil a regulation that says that nothing more serious

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:35.910
 with higher risk can be approved so if there is something new it is at least

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:38.910
 less burdensome with less risk than the previous

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:43.050
 it is stupid to delay the analysis of things is almost like defending the

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:48.510
 penicillin with much more modern drugs available is an analogy and

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:54.060
 look it only changes from the outside when you buy anything we are having a strict

00:29:54.060 --> 00:30:00.390
 phytosanitary control if we were not producing some poison not

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:06.290
 buy and brazil taking into account the amount of food produced

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:12.210
 and radio consumption than Brazil when we are the fourth country in the world ahead

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:19.140
 hence a multitude of other countries that consume the most pesticide use in their grandson

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:22.260
 your crop the highest use per hectare of pesticides

00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:27.570
 president is in japan and out of curiosity it is the country with the longest longevity of

00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:31.530
 people live longer so much the question is not this simplicity

00:30:31.530 --> 00:30:35.780
 reasoning question to use correctly apply correctly

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:40.600
 to respect the sun, to know how to handle it, you are creating a

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.930
 program to train farmers to handle them in the most efficient way

00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:48.340
 suitable is even on the last trip to osaka

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:52.420
 I talked to the Japanese Prime Minister because when I arrived it was soon

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:57.100
 after lunch at the capital's bar but was already in japan

00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:01.840
 we went to a gallery and then a steakhouse at night the company went down

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:06.790
 its the law and because the prisoner went for a walk in japan he hadn’t going to do that day

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:12.370
 the time zone 12 hours so I went to walk to be able when I arrive

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:17.950
 on Sunday the next day hang on and at night in a steakhouse there is

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:23.860
 very grudgingly because he cannot spend money on the press

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:28.450
 you know i liked you knowing only you but i will film you in the box

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:34.870
 electronic even filming you on so we started a barbecue at night in japan

00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:43.630
 and Australian meat in two moments of the g20 group there and I spoke to those

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:48.040
 authorities but it was there especially Japanese I invited him since he is in

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:52.780
 Chile this year that Brazil will be able to, if you can, right the question of time zone

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:58.600
 in addition to lunch in Brazil and I want to I want to pay for a barbecue

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:03.910
 I want to pay for the press now I want to pay for a barbecue for the Japanese delegation

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:09.220
 you can be sure after the Japanese open their eyes and eat our

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:14.050
 meat and will not want more generic place in the world it will import meat from

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:22.060
 Brazil and we intend to open up if the meat market cué with japan will

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:25.210
 make barbecue for sure going Brazilian

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:31.090
 you will pay the bill the champion the last subject here and I will owe

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:35.560
 nor will I speak for something that failed to get the data from the IRS because the

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:38.740
 business that looks only even as president is difficult is not because the

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:45.970
 recipe time withholding from mothers nothing to do is that it is complicated to seek access from

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:50.720
 Brazil because you know there's a lot down there so

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:56.780
 I take a robbery here was not from São Paulo of approximately 60 700

00:32:56.780 --> 00:33:00.140
 kilos of gold we start running after where

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:06.320
 this gold comes from where it was distracted it is private the company has an invoice

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:09.380
 which is more important how much tax is in Brazil

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:18.559
 so the data in the recipe is from Brazil only 77 tons of gold were extracted

00:33:18.559 --> 00:33:24.559
 77 thousand that is not true, I already worked with gold mining, it is not true only 77 thousand that

00:33:24.559 --> 00:33:30.260
 it is not that the lying recipe is not this one official data this gold that was

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:34.010
 stolen now that it hasn't been found yet I didn't want to know how much

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:41.240
 approximately is tax in brazil sure less than 10% even me

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.049
 help percent

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:51.340
 made a contract back there multinational companies we will honor the contracts

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:54.630
 no problem to show you here

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:59.230
 when it comes to riches what goes away

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:04.450
 now that we talk about legalizing the mining that would legalize the project

00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:07.870
 knowing the legislature can be our executive who goes to bed passes in

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:15.190
 senate so that rules are created for the poor gold digger who is perhaps too

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:22.090
 watching the pará the rich land he can then be

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:30.700
 garimpeiro and having the dignity that he can is also with some information is

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:35.700
 preserve the environment do not use mercury the world falls on my head

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:41.649
 thinking about where it’s big, right, until it preserves the environment, one of the

00:34:41.649 --> 00:34:52.030
 girls who took it from here i don't know if this one is paracatu minas gerais it would be

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:56.020
 complicated but people can see it on the internet on google and how it looks

00:34:56.020 --> 00:35:03.580
 region there so to certain betti attack to control 70 and that there was a commitment

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:08.020
 reforestation afterwards now because these multinational companies that are

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:14.670
 you can quite explore brazil and the poor galli on the personal side personally

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:20.320
 Doubt was forgetting the excuse of who to walk to the troop painting

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:26.410
 there is no room is between us here so that a gold digger cannot

00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:36.040
 for example exercising this activity lbp wants to know if she is doing another

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:41.440
 thing is getting closer this guy can't ta companies can what we have

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:46.839
 idea has talked to mizael defense is doing with the air starts all

00:35:46.839 --> 00:35:51.430
 world here we want a solution for this case the bento viewpoint that the minister

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:55.980
 of mines and energy is working on that league bill

00:35:55.980 --> 00:36:01.230
 using gold mining not only on his farm but also on indigenous lands ready

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:06.869
 now I bought the problem with the whole world is the galaxy is going to fight

00:36:06.869 --> 00:36:13.320
 with me now that are required of the hiv lord of an escape that came close to

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:17.310
 a hole in it here he will feel the same hole wanting the

00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:22.440
 alas if you have toothache the salles and he just

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:26.820
 has a way to look for a dentist last year I was looking for such a general percy

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:31.800
 from bolsonaro who was a practical dentist of that smile close to touching

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:36.090
 and plucked with nobel taboco pliers that the Indian is our brother

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:41.010
 they want dentist who was a doctor that snake face

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:45.150
 usually dies could not save snake bite

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:50.340
 really badly ricardo gomes is another thing how you see brothers you

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:55.350
 young people dying from common illness like let's not talk about golden health

00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:59.430
 white let's not talk about fundaj is not in normal life

00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:04.680
 the state of your reservation he has a problem i don't know with the life expectancy of

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:10.680
 an Indian in a reserve if ours is in the 72 72

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:15.600
 I think his is only under 50 I think I'm sure but it is much more

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:18.720
 below that is ours what they lack what they want

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:24.270
 in this land you get an Yanomami reserve that not only in the Amazon

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:27.950
 at the moment twice the size of rio de janeiro

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:33.300
 imagined you take the law from end to end and tatiana fields there is no I don't know

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:44.100
 how many km are there and not abnormal and twice the size of rio de janeiro the

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:49.680
 sun is the text more or less much smaller fox serra do sol is much smaller than the

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:54.359
 land-based hatch he wants to plant his up to the platform

00:37:54.359 --> 00:37:59.750
 yes she wants to plant our land if that Paulo is doable

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:06.119
 they want his life I need people from the state to look for

00:38:06.119 --> 00:38:09.990
 take care of their lives they want to take care of their own life since it’s like we have Indians and

00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:14.760
 it looked better mature thick bush that there are no new fields even seems to us

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:17.069
 keep the automaker that was being last year

00:38:17.069 --> 00:38:24.960
 in 2017 the amount of 120 million 129 rita or planting has changed and now

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:29.910
 come on were assembled that were using the organism genetically

00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:34.890
 modified GMO within indigenous land that cannot be on the side of each

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:40.079
 fence can there from each other fence cannot even the environment is the same

00:38:40.079 --> 00:38:46.339
 is a rule that is purely legal has no criterion is technical to not be able

00:38:46.339 --> 00:38:49.680
 nor are we going there are the people who like everything

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:53.720
 natural is against the transgenic I while it is vile I have seen people defending there

00:38:53.720 --> 00:39:00.270
 is the natural food in a can of coca cola does not know the formula of coca cola

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:06.210
 roberto is rich don't know he and his hawk professor download here steal the

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:10.500
 nobody's idea is the event sparrow teacher wins stolen the idea is right but

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:13.549
 it is a reality

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:19.020
 the novelty here a message was missing 30 seconds your language proposes later

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:31.230
 entered in Portuguese that speaks well the Brazilian favorite with China

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:40.680
 unicom year what are they worth but the brazilian you are as brazilian as we are

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:48.480
 peoples from this america i want the message from the purest heart of the

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:54.210
 that this has our brothers here the people who use the index as a mass of

00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:59.910
 maneuver to scrape more and more land to leave

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:06.450
 isolated as if it were 11 it will be I joined unerthaw this is not a class nor

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:11.190
 ask him what they want I didn't ask him to talk to them

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:18.819
 the gang there in fox fox Serra do Sol, the journey has a lot of camouflage, right?

00:40:18.819 --> 00:40:27.849
 more game in the amazon than in the northeastern hinterland much more we will do

00:40:27.849 --> 00:40:33.460
 everything to integrate them into society if he passes for sure he wants to create

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:41.380
 robots for sure is more is that the electricity on the property you want

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:44.799
 yes there is that line of flour house how is it to move the house

00:40:44.799 --> 00:40:50.049
 of flour nowadays is manually even you get a palette that calls to stir

00:40:50.049 --> 00:40:54.579
 in the flour then look at motor electrical energy the

00:40:54.579 --> 00:41:00.790
 engine on the side there makes the flour for them they want the technology that we have is

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:04.180
 fair we deny this to human beings as

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:08.859
 they are on our side that what we have better than that people

00:41:08.859 --> 00:41:13.990
 that they confined I don't want his good usually I just wanted money from NGOs

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:19.930
 to keep them inside his property confine if he doesn't want it

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:24.250
 so brazilian india is as smart as us

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:28.210
 if you take his son and one of us here we will vote

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:32.500
 he will grow up like that legitimate biological person’s son doesn’t have

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:37.359
 difference and increasingly hide the Indian not

00:41:37.359 --> 00:41:41.770
 defends the Indian we are following here is seeking

00:41:41.770 --> 00:41:50.109
 build the electric power line of manaus a boa vista in roraima up to 16

00:41:50.109 --> 00:41:53.440
 years we are is Brazil is trying and not

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:58.690
 can do is an environmental problem that practically decided to get married now

00:41:58.690 --> 00:42:04.119
 have problem with smart indigenist is using ios india to hinder

00:42:04.119 --> 00:42:10.210
 this and we spend a year on energy there, now big almost

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:17.500
 totality now d or e mané is diesel oil is spending on what to do

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:21.640
 putting in the account of the other Brazilians for one billion two hundred

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:26.619
 I do not think the environmental damage of those who look to generate better, but then the

00:42:26.619 --> 00:42:32.380
 ecochato people don’t talk about it don’t talk about it don’t say that there

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:37.480
 this old thermoelectric plant are just some of roraima generates charisma energy

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:41.619
 and pollute the environment I don’t speak because it’s interest and not developing the state

00:42:41.619 --> 00:42:45.760
 of roraima the state has a very rich subsoil and

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:49.359
 I’m sure I’d like they’ve already spoken here I’d like to explore the

00:42:49.359 --> 00:42:53.170
 riches that exist there you get the genetic metal map right

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:58.150
 all the colors there are more to the north of rolling that includes fox mountain of the sun

00:42:58.150 --> 00:43:03.099
 and also Yanomami reserves the richest area in the world on the planet another quite

00:43:03.099 --> 00:43:07.690
 rich the valley of the ribeira in são paulo a lot of things too so start

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:12.640
 attractive from paraguay already 10 years old and play and miracatu

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:16.690
 the line on the side of São Paulo by coincidence is the land where I grew up

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:20.980
 so there is everything there these already have everything I have said that every time I went to Rome

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:26.549
 figuratively speaking if I were king of rome it is with technology and 20 years

00:43:26.549 --> 00:43:33.369
 would have an economy theme close to japan this is true and it is fair we condemn

00:43:33.369 --> 00:43:38.259
 the people of this land we know we have the hi to face

00:43:38.259 --> 00:43:43.599
 bureaucracy parliament soon he doesn't speak our language what is it like to get a car

00:43:43.599 --> 00:43:48.339
 it wasn’t to defend them it wasn’t to defend he’s

00:43:48.339 --> 00:43:51.940
 right to defend international interests that they have in the region

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:59.319
 officers are interested in abusive year numbers about the Amazon region

00:43:59.319 --> 00:44:05.289
 why more and more we weaken less and less we cannot say that the

00:44:05.289 --> 00:44:09.029
 the amazon is our crazy thing was to attract the

00:44:09.029 --> 00:44:14.589
 president is the reason for our visit here in the federal capital first is

00:44:14.589 --> 00:44:19.210
 a very great honor Saturday participating in this broadcast to

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:22.509
 I live the reason for our life which is precisely

00:44:22.509 --> 00:44:27.039
 is everything and a little more of what your excellence mentioned

00:44:27.039 --> 00:44:33.819
 we live in a very rich land will talk about grain cultivation where before

00:44:33.819 --> 00:44:37.779
 today rice farmers planted all of them minister

00:44:37.779 --> 00:44:43.989
 they are all embargoed and we are prohibited from producing an area

00:44:43.989 --> 00:44:48.400
 that is already consolidated and that there is no type of deforestation there is no type

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:54.069
 of punishment nothing we have plowing areas with a

00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:59.019
 known in moema and we cannot produce because it is produced in large

00:44:59.019 --> 00:45:04.029
 scale we will be mutated we will have our production embargoed but that is not what

00:45:04.029 --> 00:45:10.089
 we want us we indigenous peoples we live a new lifestyle we

00:45:10.089 --> 00:45:17.140
 we are in the 21st century, there is no president or hunting and fishing

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:22.329
 can say how NGOs claim to care for and preserve their culture that live in a way

00:45:22.329 --> 00:45:26.259
 culturally there is no possibility

00:45:26.259 --> 00:45:32.559
 in the present day of living the way that our parents used to live there is no

00:45:32.559 --> 00:45:36.640
 possibility today the demands are different today

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:42.369
 our needs are different so we do need opportunity

00:45:42.369 --> 00:45:46.809
 to grow and develop our indigenous communities participate in the

00:45:46.809 --> 00:45:50.829
 our state's economy participate in the growth and development of our

00:45:50.829 --> 00:45:57.009
 country and we are your patriots president so much with you sir we're going

00:45:57.009 --> 00:46:02.309
 fight for our right not to remain in an indigenous reserve

00:46:02.309 --> 00:46:09.609
 only remain but producing in a way that guarantees the strengthening of the

00:46:09.609 --> 00:46:14.499
 our communities and strengthening our culture because that is the only way we can

00:46:14.499 --> 00:46:19.150
 strengthens the culture is not just the Indian year of starvation

00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:25.239
 with so many social problems today our young people are in our city and they

00:46:25.239 --> 00:46:31.479
 are being sought after by the factions and many of them being killed as

00:46:31.479 --> 00:46:35.859
 lately happening in my family the 23 year old boy lost his life because

00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:40.390
 went to look for jobs in the city we don't want that we want to have the

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:44.050
 right and warranties on this that we produce in

00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:48.730
 large scale and that we can live well and better

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:55.000
 we are not starving but our daily diet is not

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.840
 having the quality it should be and your body very well

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:05.200
 life expectancy does not improve due to lack of quality of life and food

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:11.290
 the question is in the favela of the funai indian in good view the motto yes

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:16.990
 look, folks, favela dn boa vista takes what happened

00:47:16.990 --> 00:47:22.720
 farmers in the past went to the region to get title to the land

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:27.910
 then come the governments of the special pt but it started back there with collor fhc it was

00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:30.970
 a disgrace fernando henrique cardoso a disgrace

00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:37.840
 to Brazil on this issue of indigenous reserves as well and it was demarcated then

00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:43.690
 in the squid government your buddy has been consolidated from the marking and they stay

00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:46.270
 for example brazil the white that was there

00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:51.520
 married to an indian he had to go out with his kids if you couldn't stay

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:55.320
 there the woman could get big or the opposite the imt married to the white one

00:47:55.320 --> 00:48:00.520
 destroy the family break up with families break up with families

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:05.080
 the pt is an expert in this, he commented to the Cuban family that it was said that

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:10.270
 it was like with manpower and to make money from the dictatorship of the program more

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:15.510
 average family broke apart only mine went away from the outskirts of good view

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:24.520
 slum Indians what we want to give the right to in addition to exploring the land

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:29.620
 may expose tourism to land so that they can, for example, for the

00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:34.630
 tourism wealth is wonderful, right, waterfalls

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:41.230
 lakes forest native to the culture says you can't do that there when someone

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:46.270
 speak on the other side of the line speak that I am talking about wanting the Indian too much

00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:54.040
 remember something in bolivia who is the father of bolivia ó 100% in

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.880
 bolivia after the president of the republic here he has

00:48:56.880 --> 00:49:02.490
 to be a prehistoric being within your land this is not fair and inhuman and

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:07.440
 that is cowardice is criminal and in a large part of these reserves what is there

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:12.059
 clandestine gold and diamond mining as it does not

00:49:12.059 --> 00:49:15.809
 we have information from tomorrow's russell honoré reservation

00:49:15.809 --> 00:49:19.890
 hello i went to say something i went there president we got there in the reservation use the

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:25.319
 stop with the team the class ran all over and came slowly and talk

00:49:25.319 --> 00:49:29.970
 if you install yourself in case I have recorded the video of the chief

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:34.049
 the chief of the cinta wide talks like that we want to produce nor did you say that

00:49:34.049 --> 00:49:39.720
 want to produce or do right and to and throw the subject to illegality is

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:44.369
 doing things poorly done in taking care of the environment without being cautious loses

00:49:44.369 --> 00:49:48.410
 collection loses job loses development anything goes

00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:54.000
 looks only today as a rule a large part that says defending the Indian is

00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:00.450
 exactly the opposite is exploring but one thing I have to say in this

00:50:00.450 --> 00:50:05.130
 subject I am rondinelli chosen in the region of fox serra do sol in roraima

00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:10.680
 I would like to say not always in this line of informal conversation that NGOs today

00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:16.529
 Catholic church is so cowardly with us that the priests who are there in

00:50:16.529 --> 00:50:21.270
 indigenous land fox fox do sol can be a challenge to the press and film there

00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:27.900
 time there is an Indian almost everything from south africa everything from the outside I didn’t speak ill speak

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:31.559
 Portuguese so this is bad for us we don't

00:50:31.559 --> 00:50:37.799
 manages to own the land that we consider to be Brazil is ours is is

00:50:37.799 --> 00:50:43.200
 along that line and the president is very sad for those who live there what unites them which is a

00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:47.309
 man who always wanted to see that relative is the worst house they have

00:50:47.309 --> 00:50:52.470
 filmed and took pictures and ask for money out there and with that they have more

00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:55.770
 ease came the management brasilia said

00:50:55.770 --> 00:51:00.869
 the pt dodô that came all week claimed 0 including it was fine

00:51:00.869 --> 00:51:04.910
 that was it and today we suffered a lot

00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:11.340
 enjoyed wanting the demarcation are gone but we who stayed here we

00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:17.460
 we are we are suffering we are suffering so much financial that we far away

00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:24.240
 of our land in roraima is full of Venezuelans and we are unable to

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:29.730
 job where are we going to run for even when we are going to suffer and having the

00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:33.630
 wealth we cannot exploit we cannot exploit league ore

00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:36.840
 can charge anything president I would very much like it if

00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:43.170
 these relatives our brothers are there to analyze each one with great affection

00:51:43.170 --> 00:51:46.920
 let's think about our children and tomorrow we'll leave a little

00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:50.820
 i'm not campaigning but i wanted you to look at us and

00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:56.270
 feel in the skin what we are going to leave our children tomorrow their curiosity

00:51:56.370 --> 00:52:03.570
 last year all and seeing excuse ok is roraima exported in the past 194

00:52:03.570 --> 00:52:08.430
 kilos of gold I asked do you have a mine is legal and illegal is she who knows

00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:14.580
 a black gold mine takes well ends cool man they go at night

00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:19.620
 out of time they take and clothes all this wealth is

00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:25.200
 legal I don’t know why the federal government seizes where the public prosecutor doesn’t

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:32.040
 I find charm and steal everything from the network I am a witness I have seen they passed

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:38.850
 every big car but we go as president I can't stay for

00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:42.360
 complaint does not know is that it seeks the solution presents we will seek the solution

00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:45.840
 president we have an immigration law that I

00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:50.460
 I was two parliamentarians only speak out against immigration law when it was

00:52:50.460 --> 00:52:55.440
 discussed in the chamber the author of the law was a student if she is

00:52:55.440 --> 00:53:00.270
 here at that moment is the project it was his the senator and he was ahead

00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:05.370
 foreign ministry is an unbelievable law

00:53:05.370 --> 00:53:09.990
 Brazil is no man's land no one can enter here there are more

00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:13.800
 right that you are watching there so what happens can you do a lot

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:16.480
 thing but we have to first must was from

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:22.090
 information our brothers here who are here in the big suit jackets

00:53:22.090 --> 00:53:28.750
 tie or working there in the urban area you have to gradually and understand the

00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:34.270
 truth of this information war with regard to the Amazon region I have already

00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:38.200
 I spoke several times the triple to speak again next week again we have

00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:42.490
 that there is war to be able to take concrete measures that to be an event

00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:47.410
 with the project now needs a project he has no authority even if the dictator stops

00:53:47.410 --> 00:53:54.940
 seeking solutions is what these people need to show you that they are

00:53:54.940 --> 00:54:00.880
 who lives in the urban area who are the Indians they want and the great farce

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:09.940
 the great lie of NGOs and religious entities in the case is Catholic

00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:17.080
 if they make me against these people differently from the gospel when I see

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:22.030
 really doing a good job in that medium is regrettably a part of

00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:26.830
 catholic church tata aimed at keeping them in the state they are in

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:29.590
 are not concerned with their development not so concerned

00:54:29.590 --> 00:54:33.340
 and treating them like human beings in time look for a solution to that the first

00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:37.990
 step we won the war here gives the communication

00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:42.340
 with you ending something but the president

00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:46.930

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:10.280
 president show and do and have a solution to serve our people

00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:12.610
 indigenous

00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:20.450
 we are we cannot produce on a large scale

00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:38.020

00:56:50.090 --> 00:57:00.010
 I want to bring this to the attention of the business to be able to leave and

00:57:00.010 --> 00:57:08.960
 take action I want the president of all these

00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:14.110
 Brazil has a law and a country that has a law due to legal process

00:57:14.110 --> 00:57:17.660
 wide defense opportunity this is very important

00:57:17.660 --> 00:57:22.160
 Brazil is a country that has followed its constitution has a legal framework that we

00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:27.740
 we will enforce the laws respect the laws and when necessary if necessary

00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:32.510
 changes if the law is the way it works in a country that follows due legal process and

00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:36.110
 to brazil an example of this is important that we can make it clear here

00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:39.810
 i don't have any foreign aa version

00:57:39.810 --> 00:57:44.880
 is what i don't want is foreigners illegally in my own brazil

00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:49.230
 who is not here in the form of the law in my opinion has to be the same until

00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:55.860
 the half-ass is edited the ordinance weird number right 666 so that he has more

00:57:55.860 --> 00:58:01.230
 easy to do that saves to send foreigners out of brazil who

00:58:01.230 --> 00:58:06.780
 have committed crimes in your faith in your father has nothing to do with that journalist

00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:13.380
 the one that he already smart and quito accused today that the expulsion from Brazil but

00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:17.640
 we must have stricter law to protect exactly is our port nothing

00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:25.140
 as foreigners but legally within Brazil but the people of a

00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:28.590
