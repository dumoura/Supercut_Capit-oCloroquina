00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:20.829
the muscular pain in the back of my eyes and around seventeen o'clock I took a

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:26.710
 chloroquine tablet is a right of mine duly guided by the doctor

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.150
 I recommend that you do the same thing if you want if you feel symptoms right

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.820
 always guided by the doctor right after I took the exam and at around 6 pm Monday

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:44.380
 Tuesday morning on Tuesday I took another pill from joaquina soon

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:51.490
 then confirmation came that I was contaminating on Tuesday 17th I

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.260
 I took one more pill and from then on the consecutive days until today

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.430
 Thursday at 5 pm also make a tablet tomorrow I worked one more and

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.180
 made it very clear that you will testify is mine as dr kalil spoke in

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.130
 sao paulo when on the beach i think that about two months he went

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.449
 affected person took it during his treatment

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:19.240
 even behind it weak and I took it and everything worked out very well thanks to god right

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.789
 and that critic, right, at least present an alternative, it doesn’t work is that the

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:30.310
 curtain you have to take in seeing medicine or else the anitta that the other

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:37.120
 well that is widely commented out there that they are effective in the treatment of

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.940
 coronavirus in my case it worked ok i'm not not seeing anything with this i'm

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.240
 advertising the two chains I have no business with this

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.979
 company I don’t even know which company this one is, but ok, two more one or two

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:56.949
 companies that are in yours that manufacture this medicine here so what I

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:02.050
 I can talk about my testimony, we know that none of these remedies here

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.510
 in quotes has scientific proof but as for example behind the war

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.910
 ally of the plant patient the soldier arrived wounded healthy

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:17.390
 I needed a transfusion I didn't have blood to transfuse him what

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:22.370
 that they did at that time to start injecting, there was no way it was coconut in the

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.650
 vein of the soldier there who had lost a lot of blood and it worked out if it was for

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.540
 in scientific confirmation how long at that time is the same thing we have

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:38.070
 reports of hundreds of meters in brazil and hundreds special

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:44.430
 is only if treated with it and it worked so who doesn't want to take care that

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:50.070
 do not sleep now do not stay there wanting to prohibit people who happen to be here

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.180
 she takes it once contaminated, right and after a medical recommendation I

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:59.910
 I do ah and it also makes it clear, right back there, I'm

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.190
 now seeing articles in the press until finally

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:09.770
 start showing things here hunger can kill more than the invitation your name

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:15.420
 I used to say that back in March, I was beaten a lot in the media, the company is there

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:20.190
 you that we watching there bro his look if you know with a couple did a

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.970
 word of mine to headline the morning press being broken too much into

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:28.860
 me in the past when I said that the side effect of fighting the virus does not

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:34.020
 can be more damaging than the virus itself than the issue of the destruction of

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:39.750
 jobs we have had over these three four months in Brazil one

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:48.870
 fantastic destruction of jobs in Brazil and other causes, you know, and this one

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:55.470
 issues unemployment leads to death so and leads to depression leads to suicide like

00:07:55.470 --> 00:08:03.000
 I had little now in the city of minas Paracatu, I had no less here in

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.150
 the araguari road police station and talked to some policemen

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:10.889
 federal road workers right and they saw there was that the number of pedestrians being run over

00:08:10.889 --> 00:08:16.229
 on the track had multiplied by three approximately I asked what can

00:08:16.229 --> 00:08:22.410
 have been run over multiply by three pandemics ef present for what

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:28.320
 everything seems to be proven on the road, but this is the cause of this is suicide or

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.370
 be desperate people right what’s happening and practice suicide

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:37.110
 unfortunately it's not proven to be given to you, right, the policeman who spoke to me

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:44.329
 said it is an assumption on his part, it could have been is suicide

00:08:44.329 --> 00:08:49.129
 good then from the beginning I said we should take care of life like that and also of

00:08:49.129 --> 00:08:54.290
 unemployment issue and I was to get paid because of that the government

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:58.639
 federal court did its part, right, since the supreme federal court said

00:08:58.639 --> 00:09:03.439
 clearly in peace that restrictive measures were a competence is

00:09:03.439 --> 00:09:09.170
 exclusive of governors and mayors our president eats what gives means right

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:14.959
 resources for gifts and for governors the intention of mayor and

00:09:14.959 --> 00:09:20.360
 governor back there she avoided a very rapid transition of the virus and so

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:26.329
 that there was an accumulation of contaminated people is at the door of hospitals

00:09:26.329 --> 00:09:31.100
 their intention was right it was wrong you decide I will not give my opinion

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:38.089
 in terms of leaving, I would act differently, look, I couldn’t comment on

00:09:38.089 --> 00:09:43.670
 these issues can even companies roll over state debt to not

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:47.519
 proof ah ah no no charging interest for a

00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:52.439
 time of what is in the municipality of saw for us right the distribution of material

00:09:52.439 --> 00:09:56.730
 so that someone will have to research it better and come to a conclusion

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:02.459
 because people are really dying at the bakery, right?

00:10:02.459 --> 00:10:08.220
 glasses the same way the year goes by so that's it the researchers

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:14.939
 knowledgeable people there is research so now something is a reality the virus

00:10:14.939 --> 00:10:20.999
 the one who has to protect is the elderly, my case, 65 years of age and people

00:10:20.999 --> 00:10:26.399
 who has certain diseases as a skill, has no immune system

00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:32.069
 still resistant ok the others must be careful yes but if i find a virus no

00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:37.139
 you have to panic a lot but a lot of people against the virus and you know

00:10:37.139 --> 00:10:41.699
 find me later as he did a test up front and saw that he had a body

00:10:41.699 --> 00:10:48.270
 didn't even know he had a good virus so my lord my lady saw the

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:54.210
 concern about employment exists is great so start press say here

00:10:54.210 --> 00:11:00.260
 that hunger can kill more than invitations in just starvation is not depression

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:04.440
 stick to the place of that head of household who takes for example 2 thousand per

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:10.290
 month has 23 kilos and lose job and knows that nowadays the difficulty in

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:14.760
 get a job but impossible but a day job without taking into account

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.580
 around 40 million informal in Brazil that guy who sold

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:25.920
 cat barbecue right yes or no chocolate a luminous sign a biscuit

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:32.190
 on the beach a beat in the stands at the football game and these on average right

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:36.779
 lost eighty percent of its power that day but only complicated and that the

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:42.870
 government did to meet the needs these created it there you face $ 600

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:47.260
 started now erase starts to start paying week fourth installment of aid

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:52.390
 emergency and the fifth so next month now the government has no way of maintaining

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:58.630
 this assistance for a long time and per month is approximately for you 50

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:03.940
 billions of reais we cannot go into debt so much this is not

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:08.560
 money that was in the running somewhere is indebtedness on the part of the

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:15.220
 government so I hope your governors the mayors right

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:20.890
 responsible as they are starts to open the trade as soon as possible with

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.930
 an answer from her that is peculiar to her everybody and otherwise

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:34.589
 and the problems are getting worse and a lot in Brazil and the food you eat doesn't get right

00:12:34.589 --> 00:12:39.630
 complicated I believe in polo guess has given interviews saying speaking form

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:44.760
 positive what economy is going to pick up believe in it we just saw now that the stock market and

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:50.190
 reached 100 thousand points is the number that we have exceeded a lot and this year

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:55.110
 past and fell with the bed learning it and came back now you know is that number without saw

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:58.800
 is money sign sees growth in the economy the confidence the market I hope

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:04.529
 that the interest rate works out without the rate so low, right, two points 25 per

00:13:04.529 --> 00:13:11.640
 cent compared to last year this year we should pay approximately 120

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:20.160
 billions of reais this is good for us it helps our economy he owes it

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.910
 pays less interest, our debt becomes lower, there are signs that

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:30.960
 we do need governors and mayors from within the responsible

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.800
 responsibility that exists begins to open up trade that otherwise the

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.779
 damaging consequences for everyone in brazil the

00:13:39.779 --> 00:13:45.480

00:14:05.149 --> 00:14:09.360
 summer application would spend a lot more to find spending less on mines

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:14.040
 general I heard a security voice for it was going to work because usually when

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:18.509

00:14:18.509 --> 00:14:25.010

 federal capital on the day of the stab adélio bishop was incompetent or distracted

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:58.840

 calling fascist generally think that you call me a starter don't even know the

00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:21.059
 that is fascist

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:28.280
 and this plane from the Bolsonaro of transparent lace, beautiful thing is putting

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:32.020

 and the Brazilian will only be free when the last shot was hanged in the guts

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:44.590
 the last one is fine what happens I'm at home right there’s always television

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:48.850
 I'm working straight, don't do the same touch

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:55.210
 ask video couple or the other and the wave is now to say that the pages

00:18:55.210 --> 00:19:00.730
 right the pocket of the bolsonaro family of advisers if you earn public money

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:07.389
 for that, it promotes oil, I challenge this company that speaks about its presence in

00:19:07.389 --> 00:19:12.610
 special television televisions that keep making room for my account in

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:19.149
 my account in a hateful text of mine or of those people by my side after a

00:19:19.149 --> 00:19:24.389
 image a fearful image my facebook my son and point a

00:19:24.389 --> 00:19:30.539
 image has nothing I try all accusing hatred what what what what I

00:19:30.539 --> 00:19:35.820
 would have now that you win and now accusing anyone in brazil of

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:42.950
 anything there is nothing touching this 00 nothing because this persecution

00:19:43.969 --> 00:19:48.929
 of course I see that I want to speak the name of this television here, happy with

00:19:48.929 --> 00:19:54.779
 that right, thinking that destroying in quotes, decreasing the cheese of the media

00:19:54.779 --> 00:19:59.519
 social and who will believe this television will not believe they have

00:19:59.519 --> 00:20:04.109
 discreet for a long time no one believes in these lies anymore ok we miss

00:20:04.109 --> 00:20:09.570
 in Brazil it’s not a right channel, it’s a right channel for points

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:14.029
 radio and television programs are good you are reliable are few

00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:19.259
 existed exists and prestige stress grows in popularity grow

00:20:19.259 --> 00:20:25.600
 advertisers and they will succeed what they have all the time, you know, work for

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:31.270
 overthrow the government to say that we have been producing material today that that

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:36.490
 run what is voice material present text right you feel think and in

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:42.400
 facebook my instagram whatsapp but even hard to know more about each other

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:48.940
 any other social friend is beating the legislature in the judiciary in either

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:53.800
 any way it doesn’t exist it’s not unfortunate it’s going on we don’t
