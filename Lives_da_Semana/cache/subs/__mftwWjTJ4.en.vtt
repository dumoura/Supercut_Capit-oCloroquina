 car crowd there we go in the oven here a lot treated the numbers

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.220
 good morning has been present we must end the year with inflation

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.510
 below the target average we have five and a half of the selic rate is fast and the

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.290
 life here that he tends to the economy or at least so there is not even the

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.599
 possibility also using with four and a half there are each percent in the rate

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.970
 I will pay you the next year, right, minus 40 billion reais Now let's go

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.760
 you always say right some of that or bad lowers the selic rate plus the check

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.370
 special a cow how much is the overdraft month

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.010
 the 1499 savings box went to when 8/90 currently how to round

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.440
 us percent per month is high very high but the average of other banks is

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.549
 while even if you were fifteen percent cashier, you are not a customer of

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:11.209
 cash comes to cash you also like it you like so overdraft right i never

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.120
 I entered within my time that she lieutenant captain desert for him to speak

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.060
 who was a deputy is president no you don't need that time never never

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.739
 I resorted there if we needed power, even using we have only one thing that

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.790
 has an important bank of mathematics bank of all Brazilians and banks of

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.920
 humbler people we made this reduction and we will not lose money you

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.620
 it is very important that you pay the client, come on, it’s another thing that I’m going to

 talk about the guarantee fund for length of service fgts datafolha spoke

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.640
 that only 45 to act that same only 45 percent well to

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.320
 the first installment was for the people who are customers of the savings account, so

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.140
 membership hit hit 99 point 12 percent now will enter the staff who

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.840
 not a customer the second step logically i think this price i just

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.340
 will fall a lot but even if it falls a lot staying presents sixty per

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.400
 percent store that has to stay weighted average I don't know how many

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.980
 customers are the most not from the box or outside but the average will be much above

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:24.330
 45 percent stick data sheet seventy percent there data sheet if I

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.390

 cashier was ten eleven percent decreased by 8:30 and now there are 76

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.090
 right and a half percent a year a year and every mathematical reduction from the central bank

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:08.129

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:14.370
 giving back to society and home interest reduction measure will follow

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:21.779

 hi president and she remains a great is

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:52.279
 partner of ours and here my regret of January i'm going to

00:10:52.279 --> 00:10:56.300
 put a piece of paper on my desk here the united states issues a note on it

00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:01.339
 is the american embassy watzapwueb entrance from brazil does not budge but says that

00:11:01.339 --> 00:11:05.899
 it must happen in rhythm the controlled rhythm is not arrived

00:11:05.899 --> 00:11:13.970
 you make a selection and the selection is dropper for exactly that slu o

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:20.600
 country 500 right he buys everything that is in the status of oceania is because

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.550
 they can't go wrong and brazil will come its time now brazil tried to

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:31.189
 2017 is not not to enter from today to tomorrow it takes more than a year to enter and

00:11:31.189 --> 00:11:36.829
 it didn’t work was the present understand Brazil started to have problems this was

00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:41.600
 cooled down now the pt government wouldn't even try to see it succeed

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.879
 no way so this cdf collection is more than explained

00:11:46.879 --> 00:11:52.380
 we remain firm and strong and if god wants a year from now a year and

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:57.480
 little this we will be there if god wants anything you inside is not

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:02.850
 important but it is also important today we had several conversations with the

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:07.560
 lord of sides even in the united states and a senator at the tomato lunch who

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:12.120
 it is very important without a doubt but the initiatives of the lord of the minister

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:18.209
 Paulo Guedes and making bilateral agreements in economic terms is sensational and I

00:12:18.209 --> 00:12:23.399
 hadn't seen yet is a forum of such international interest was

00:12:23.399 --> 00:12:28.800
 surprising a surprising more present but this demonstrates with solid is

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:35.269
 these expectations and fundamentals of the economy I had five bilateral ones still

00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:41.450
 and and the confidence of brazil has in the scope

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:45.680
 I'm very happy with that. Paulo Guedes is going to say that in our

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:54.590
 our commander in the economy next year there begins to work there our

00:12:54.590 --> 00:13:00.620

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:10.550
 next year begins entering the milestone camp at the military college and the name o

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:16.790
 biggest of Brazil and São Paulo is to be congratulated there to know college thing

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:22.190
 military, but where it starts to work, so there are few students, it’s more

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:34.029
 hello alright let's continue here look fake news bolsonaro promised to live

00:18:34.029 --> 00:18:39.160
 would choose the next pgr ask me how i told him one

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:43.990
 day when I always said that everyone for everyone, you know, I have the right to give my opinion

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:57.550
 you you there they put there was something sounding just him now is the is the man of the pgr is

00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:03.910
 independent as it always has to be the attorney general's office that

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:08.680
 I talked a lot with him about the economic guidelines that he already acted in that way

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:12.160
 him now what he can do so that the

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:19.690
 a certain guy is prosecutors act with more tranquility as you do leave

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:23.830
 environmental except it will do it also does not dominate there is a barracks there

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:30.330
 pgr perished the boss is not a barracks has a prosecutors there a lot of autonomy

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:36.610
 now I didn't promise anyone that he would choose the step until today I never spoke

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:42.010
 with the eye here look and continuing here now terrible here

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:49.650
 the same day was são paulo federal government spending on advertising grows

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:54.650
 and down there another matter bandnews reduction of sixty percent in relation

00:19:54.650 --> 00:20:01.230
 to the first quarter 2018 spending on print advertising at the cemetery and so

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:11.940
 we reduced 91 to the box of 91 this is also the question of the package

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:18.030
 then the measures of so publicity the anti-crime package he dominates sérgio moro

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:22.140
 bolsonaro says it suspends advertising of anti-crime package of

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:28.610
 Moorish I participate in the event for the launch of advertising pieces

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:36.330
 a few days after I said, you know how to hear the clue that the tcu asks for

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:40.980
 that song speak so the text is either ask or if an injunction goes we lose

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:45.090
 but you also have a mini index to eliminate you in the buildings, right here in a

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:50.310
 savings bank and will wait for the end of that process, it's right to put it in my

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:55.080
 account one participates in the launch there after a few days later I said that

00:20:55.080 --> 00:21:01.150
 I will suspend and will intention to play against the fat is

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:06.530
 I stayed with you now I forgive the attack government wants to free resources

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:13.120
 from fgts to all banks is but the government did not feel a name

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:18.820
 who is a ruler who spoke president jb minister paulo guedes did not speak of

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:23.019
 no one running I say cashier wants to do this from the cashier

00:21:23.019 --> 00:21:28.090
 want to do it there now this measure if it was true do you think

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:35.340
 would bring benefits or not it is for special special those people who

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:39.960
 I seek is your home in the program my home my life or basic sanitation

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:45.669
 especially for the North and Northeast regions, especially because the banks

00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:50.230
 the private ones can do like the financial people and basically who does the

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:56.259
 nation federal savings bank I think it goes down to help more banks are you

00:21:56.259 --> 00:22:00.610
 name of the banks here i think their intention could invest more in

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:05.620
 southeast in that area and forgetting the north and northeast even because the box is present

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.920
 is in more than 5,400 municipalities the majority of private banks will be in

00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:15.830
 good so even if they want they managed to achieve such a layoff is
