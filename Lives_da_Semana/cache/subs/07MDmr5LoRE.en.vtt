00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.110
 hi and i wrote this there my whole life was 20 years old right

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.480
 hi and there was an international social security seminar when

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:49.190
 he was having the reform, there was fear, that's what made him

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.910
 and then as a guest to participate and asked for help to bring teachers

 to exterminate at the onix lorenzoni seminar saw he called to talk speech

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:28.160
 pow how cool that you guys present about social security and man it was funny because

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.910
 i had gone to canada in 2016 at the end of 2016 i went with my money i

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:42.500
 went as seen school is not and I go with my money dude got

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.240
 went to my wife i rented a web year from near victoria university which

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.610
 the capital of colombia to study social security there from canadian social security

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:59.270
 then i wrote a scientific before 12 friends from university pylon two

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.700
 university professors is not taking the social security experience of the

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.969
 canada italy and brazil hi and we published for you since the

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:16.169
 people will talk about the subject of scientific article this article that I wrote in

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:24.940
 english canada was published and it is in a qualisa magazine from italy the year

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:32.080
 later but it’s what I researched a year earlier if it was something that looks like it’s no longer

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.020
 more when you go up when afterwards the subject has lost the originality that it had

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.669
 a year before just to make it clear for those who are for those who are in

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:49.660
 watching right there are a lot of people here who follow me as a teenager also what

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.710
 cut from that day we do wanting the following for you to have a publication a

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.050
 article published in a reputable international magazine and etc. this

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.300
 follows a protocol it competes with other articles by other intellectuals

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:12.780
 teachers etc and this is standard it is normal to take a long time, right, from months to years

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.600
 and why is he saying this and why are you important at that moment

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.740
 and we're going to go into the subject of hydroxychloroquine, the next question

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.289
 that I would like to do and do to him is a lot of people say that the

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.400
 hydroxychloroquine it cannot be applied to patients because you do not

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:36.690
 has no proven effect of that right and then I give it back I give it back to arthur

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.659
 continue which is the following do you think is valid even without having this publication

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:48.449
 international application of hydroxychloroquine in patients

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:56.690
 today i will tell you the following hi duda i already experienced the world

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:04.460
 academic I is not because it has the history emerged by my academic life on the

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.890
 We ended up supporting your father initially, scientifically, we didn’t

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:16.960
 was nothing and knew us and and and this academic life took us

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:24.000
 contact with your father, we’ve already been good, and then you’re with him,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.550
 and when my brother became a minister in April last year, people wrote

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:34.710
 then I started my twitter in August and started saying that I

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.920
 I became your father's advisor because my brother became a minister that I am a

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:46.590
 nepotismo mateiro I have been your father's advisor since January 3, 2019 since

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:51.030
 day three including contributing to the government plan and we traveled together also in the

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:56.270
 taiwan south korea and japan it was exactly 2018 we are with

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:04.040
 you since the beginning 2017 and it was when it started I saw perception threatens the hell

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:12.290
 but annulled come out of the steel I will I will make you the following placement is the model

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:19.150
 academic feel I changed a falls is a thing that sells everything had no internet

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:26.300
 it was all on paper people had a few people read I just didn't know how to read and

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:33.170
 writing this scientific method dirty and most did not have access to reading

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:39.690
 so what happens with internet you can put an article is not the

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:46.200
 knowledge immediately so for me it's first i have i have all

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:53.160
 the affection that the left loves to say how cute they are at usp master's at usp

00:07:53.160 --> 00:08:00.150
 doctorate and postdoctoral fellow at the party I was a researcher looking at a lot of files

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:06.780
 everything that the left now said this it doesn't make me better than anyone here are

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:11.750
 titles and often a communist enters the academy he takes it then

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:16.620
 doctorate with his plate his plate gives a doctorate for them to do in this

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:22.470
 network so it’s not because I’m part of the group that have

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:28.380
 titling i'm going to defend some scientific has to have the reality is

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.270
 more important than formalities and then

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:37.270
 the formality the following the medieval that you submit the article you go there does

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:44.170
 the study then you submit the article it will be evaluated the plants and will

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:51.190
 work for your homes and then other articles will get better tax

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:57.310
 now he will decide how it was better and if he found it he pushes this article here he

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:02.020
 will the guy show you more than uai for vanity sometimes in the public if

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:06.460
 you don't follow the guy's line so imagine you have a political line there

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:10.840
 it is not clear that there is an article arrives that will not us political flour

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:15.070
 normally left, right, there is no right line at the university if you find me

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:22.080
 is white fly with green eye hi blue eye and then the article to be published

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.850
 a year from now the mouth what is the originality of that there that happened with the

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.670
 course clean and your father was already tuned in

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:37.180
 what people talk to him that he has a lot of north staff and we've been

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:44.740
 is entirely engineer or continues to see graphics to be done integrally and derivatives 50

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:52.500
 tuned in the clear which is hi and then days before rio de janeiro

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.959
 is it not the dollar that was in the machine I don't think it's a

00:09:56.959 --> 00:10:04.430
 mixture of other things but anyway is is is

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:08.149
 how do you look today how does the internet have the person who should have the

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:11.830
 people give a google to see who was talking before they talked about him

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:16.950
 and this beauty that was left over from the internet hi and your father turned to me he didn't

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:23.610
 said I'm the cdf he used the term there the skinny skinny system a

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:30.640
 great you wanna [ __ ] crazy said so you go there and all of that is

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:37.930
 and then I started to read a scientific article it wasn't an article, right, that's what the person

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:44.590
 am a person starts to drop they call fastware starts to drop what they

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:50.980
 are researching to spread the graphics knowledge and submission of

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:56.050
 article even submits the article to you and some magazines allow it at that time

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:59.560
 emergency that you have access to which you have been subjected to and when it is being

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:06.550
 evaluate is I started to read graph is are jokes say what do you have and

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:11.100
 feedback to read scientific article that medicine

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:17.970
 the first one that the director of the inss has for a mother has a doctor he even made fun of one day in

00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:22.070
 twitter was [ __ ] me who had to be ms director

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:29.110
 hi and my postdoctoral and these glasses here that I keep using

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:32.940
 your look at yesterday's face was this guy there cdf sometimes it is

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:36.850
 it's the opposite of the time I did it wavy

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:45.579
 is a friend I don't have a dog but at the time I was deputy director of the field if you

00:11:45.579 --> 00:11:51.120
 don't want to do the postdoctoral neurology and neurosciences

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:56.640
 and I had talked to her about Alzheimer's charts and using it because it impacts on

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:01.650
 so I had studied demography studied the part of

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:07.379
 gerontology grandson said hello sorry elderly

00:12:07.379 --> 00:12:15.179
 hi and then I took this, I said I’m going to do it and she said she doesn’t do about Alzheimer

00:12:15.179 --> 00:12:20.879
 on epilepsy the flagship of the prof epilepsy department the part

00:12:20.879 --> 00:12:26.279
 doctor made a presentation I told you about that business there

00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:31.079
 the social security law and an actuarial descriptive that I got the

00:12:31.079 --> 00:12:35.610
 thick then I remember she looked at the graphics I joined people will get her

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:42.629
 dumb that cool because in the graphics you brought me shows that you have a bread mission

00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:48.569
 and the rest of Brazil has less that is not in São Paulo has much more epileptic than

00:12:48.569 --> 00:12:53.100
 that in the rest of the country and in the rest of the world she said it doesn't make sense that you're

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:57.059
 bringing the following people well do attendance time well do the

00:12:57.059 --> 00:13:00.420
 service in são paulo and overloads the system and we didn’t have these

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:07.170
 good cats so this is just a statistical part

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:14.260
 interdisciplinary please from the government man that the accessory your father i'm not

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:18.430
 minister person talking pie solves the problem inside my box

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:24.430
 I do what I can and so I will tell you the greatest honor that I have here

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:29.920
 greatest honor that I have and that of my family I can be an advisor to the

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.930
 president president bolsonaro here for me not reaching life guy I

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:41.470
 it is not english speaking it has to be blatant for me it is not during it is not only the

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:45.160
 president people don't have a question of the importance

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:52.240
 a and pride all president bolsonaro and he has given me this

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.819
 opportunity man because when I could I told him I had you before

00:13:56.819 --> 00:14:03.069
 of the trump announce I spoke so glad I read that the junction of the first

00:14:03.069 --> 00:14:08.510
 flávio here at it's working and the chloroquine mechanism looks like

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:12.590
 malaria and I’ll explain it to you this is how I don’t

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:17.960
 I’ll explain it by language. If you have a potato in your mouth, I’ll talk

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:21.980
 no one everybody will understand who has a

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:28.790
 hi and then i said to him, joaquina is working, it has already worked and serious

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:35.540
 and they had the graphics o the guy who treated only that he didn't treat is first

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:39.590
 that so iceland i will give you the example of iceland that iceland is a

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:44.330
 closed an island and everyone is a joke genetically they have control

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:51.740
 total the flower the influence o the influenza side of the northern hemisphere she keeps 0.1 there

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:59.960
 saying yes the ovid kills three times 0.3 more cough the mortality of

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:07.420
 fatality is a big serious rule, but we see that gravity is what is

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:15.080
 statistically not as expressive 0.3 sides there so I spoke like this so here

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:21.960
 no longer a young guy who picks up a child and feels asymptomatic

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:26.280
 and ask for the taste I’m feeling the taste of things infect if you don’t

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:30.420
 safe from things totally infected i'm not feeling anything beauty but you

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:35.880
 is infected is passing there you get a person with comorbidity she if the

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:41.070
 love give me if you have another disease you die if you are 95 without

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:48.330
 comorbidities and to invite you live but so when you are 95 it is at

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:52.650
 times you sprawl god hold not because you are not that you caught the

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:56.970
 invitation you’re 25 is just to speed up the immune system

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:01.980
 weakened of course nobody wants nobody died accident but that

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:06.720
 it happens look what I passed on to your father is not I said president look this

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:12.990
 I would show you not to take bananas like that, serious cases

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:16.830
 person didn’t take anything to start to get worse going up going up and then I

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:21.870
 take pain there and the respirator has no right

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:30.180
 hi and then pizza boy the new one was here I said pros it’s like that yes who

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:34.710
 go the guy who doesn't take care of himself in rio grande do norte the 23 year old guy who

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:42.270
 it was the weight is [ __ ] obese it was in the hospital it wasn’t about them just fear was for

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:46.500
 the respirator in insurance so some cases of each young person was really serious

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:52.050
 but when it gave chloroquine and arthur will start to download the guy

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:59.319
 hail will take [ __ ] they talked for days and when I mixed almost tromycin

00:16:59.319 --> 00:17:05.220
 azithromycin took already took antibiotic one mixed with azithromycin

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:12.809
 it worked as a cocktail here or aids is an antibiotic that kills alive was for

00:17:12.809 --> 00:17:17.589
 antibiotics and bacteria this antibiotic because it is but in this case

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:22.059
 azithromycin a study showed that he played there they gave it to person

00:17:22.059 --> 00:17:29.110
 improved it improves the esteem of the cell the children he doesn’t have him in the cell to

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:36.610
 multiply and it uses the cell's system to replicate in the chloroquine

00:17:36.610 --> 00:17:42.879
 together with an azithromycin and break a symbol the outline I am the

00:17:42.879 --> 00:17:46.899
 cell the virus cannot multiply it goes there and the wall king is

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:52.629
 was left with the cell's power plant and then there is no longer how the cell will work.

00:17:52.629 --> 00:18:00.340
 virus is not because he withdraws too much he only speaks he only card the medicine

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:05.590
 now what doesn’t even get in the cell easier and he drew that vitamin de

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:12.669
 the staff's vitamin talks like this is the bone is for I don't know what it is for olor

00:18:12.669 --> 00:18:17.110
 it's not just for that pulmonary system benefit from his vitamin

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:23.260
 and I read in those studies and three months after you sunbathe still

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:27.220
 there's vitamin in your body I'm alone that you took so important

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:34.360
 take just take vitamin from there the green president looks like this I went to

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:39.610
 they give it to him, I send it to him when I get it, man, it's on loan

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:45.059
 at his desk there and then I said like this president has not

00:18:45.059 --> 00:18:51.960
 those four factors the ultra that announced chloroquine he

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:58.920
 even controls India and sent it to bahia to do it also believed in the clear

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:03.289
 that hi and then the president even after

00:19:03.289 --> 00:19:11.809
 said like this, I'm taking a tribute to the chloroquine azithromycin sweetie that

00:19:11.809 --> 00:19:15.610
 vitamin d let's throw this in there for people

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:23.710
 and then it started when your father improved hi and the job was the

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:30.309
 and the media started saying no, that story used on the internet, right if the

00:19:30.309 --> 00:19:35.140
 bolsonaro is in favor of oxygen the left will put a bag over his face to

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:40.450
 not to breathe and this is the beginning he even has an excuse matter that roberto

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:45.640
 but there is a 2016 article that I copied from your social network and twitter from

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:53.169
 your twitter including people who can follow ok is arthur with th uai that is w

00:19:53.169 --> 00:19:58.840
 en face arthur comes to twitter and instagram for us to do a

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:05.529
 salary now but I posted a 20/2016 article from Globo speaking very well of

00:20:05.529 --> 00:20:10.299
 chloroquine because chloroquine in addition to initially it uses hers was for

00:20:10.299 --> 00:20:15.940
 malaria but it was also producing is good jesus late when used against the

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:22.710
 zika virus so why the globe it doesn’t repeat this good news

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:26.000
 jack and the medical community is showing

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.820
 effective chloroquine why do you think they do that

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:39.150
 i'll tell you clearly this is how i'm not a genius but i don't juice so you

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:44.940
 start to look for animal things to chloroquine then you are serious what is the

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:49.290
 chloroquine and crox difference is as follows

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:54.780
 and what works chloroquine against malaria versus the one against

00:20:54.780 --> 00:21:02.550
 chicungunha against now invitation this is the following is an old remedy

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:06.660
 everyone must have heard it I was reading the first one I give this is

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:14.110
 important to talk about was the national email is that we always talk

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:18.760
 and here in Brazil's independence you know that I'm saying that I was a friend

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:24.899
 of the owner leopoldina i was a friend of dom pedro first gift

00:21:24.899 --> 00:21:29.910
 Pedro according to José Bonifácio José Bonifácio andrade

00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:36.750
 and he did it all about quinine and what cloud of the plant the synthetic luan and the

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:42.420
 boy work hi jane this is even i saw an o

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:49.200
 100-year-old newspaper talking ah, you got a big one, my got the flu

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:54.780
 Spanish animal takes acne in the newspaper talking here takes ninocar avoid playing

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:59.940
 queen of others avoid sneezing and take what boy is so it's in the newspaper

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:04.830
 ok bro is what boy already worked there what

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:09.890
 what happens isn’t it’s not synthetic the chloroquine is already synthetic

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:16.160
 with what that boy chloroquine or hydroxy hydroxychloroquine the chloroquine

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:21.520
 she has and then a question of

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:29.620
 is assimilated in the body, so how does it mix lipid in it if it stays

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:35.110
 the body was closer so they put the hydroxychloroquine to leave

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:40.599
 more sleep, right, ah, so it softened the effects

00:22:40.599 --> 00:22:45.980
 side effects this is the same thing as morphine you have

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:52.940
 the base of the morphine which is the option there you have the morphine which is synthetic after

00:22:52.940 --> 00:23:00.630
 you have another hand and in the bio the strongest remedies

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:06.960
 and chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine garage pocket first because that

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:11.210
 protozoan malaria [Music]

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:19.429
 and this protozoan the me the wall is hemoglobin hemoglobin that carries the

00:23:19.429 --> 00:23:25.680
 oxygen in the blood and hi and hemoglobin a little reel

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:33.700
 carretinha she was taking her own oxygen whole body here comes the suitcase o

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:39.790
 malaria protozoan and eats porphyrin there until the

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:45.700
 business here protects and the iron molecule has a molecule

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:50.890
 iron inside the blog and this iron molecule is organized and it makes

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:55.840
 she starts to munch all of that in a row why she is protected

00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:01.390
 porphyrin and this protozoa I talked like this

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:08.090
 break it, then it pays and that's when the aunt starts to break the body

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:14.150
 this is the same thing as my principle I'm not a doctor I'm telling you

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:21.360
 here from the people but it was the same principle what is the invitation the invitation is as follows

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:25.200
 your your hemoglobin is worth it man

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:30.730
 and your hemoglobin I have has a group called coughs for freedom

00:24:30.730 --> 00:24:36.429
 and are teachers who are not left-wing teachers who are normal

00:24:36.429 --> 00:24:43.470
 the right is normal, we are trained, we put it there every day

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:50.960
 look and these guys sending me talking luciano take this being fair brazil is

00:24:50.960 --> 00:25:00.470
 paulo zeloto and also sent the article and my brother sends me something too

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:03.830
 so there's nothing in this article since the following mine

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:09.680
 you’re the fan, the respirator sometimes breaks more than the

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:15.530
 benefit why because the problem in the middle of the lung do not smoke it is not moving

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:22.850
 what the fan it does butt move breathe breathe breathe if you don't have the color

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:28.220
 sorry demobile i have no reason to transport your way don't have the

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:32.830
 invitation there so when hemoglobin runs out

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:35.879
 her trailer she doesn't transport minecraft

00:25:35.879 --> 00:25:43.910
 and yours the white blood cells speak and phagocytose in them for me the hemoglobin

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:50.480
 good and start to liquefy and then leave your lung the fibrosis says that

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:57.080
 it looks like a shiny granite cover and the lung can't do it like that right away

00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:02.300
 way not because he doesn’t move bro because he doesn’t have hemoglobin anymore

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:07.430
 carrying tissot by throwing yours at 2 and giving is equal when you breathe the

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:13.490
 our carbon at the exit is talking borrowed globins and then you take

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:20.300
 the guy who's watching the video and moves that thing on his thumb there to ask

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:25.970
 oxygen saturation right, the guy is giving eighty percent oxygen when

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:30.410
 when I was watching the other day I don't have a TV I just watch the internet

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:34.450
 I was watching stories that were everest

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:40.630
 good and it is a group that likes to live dangerously and goes without the little guy there

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:46.690
 from there when the guy went to the little finger he has ninety-five percent

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:53.030
 john person calling him back is in the base camp for lost you are out

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:58.280
 i already sent it back imagine with eighty percent saturation punch for

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:03.530
 That's what I'm lying about, I'm dying, remembering that this is the case.

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:10.970
 to people who reach this stage a rare case but I'm dealing here with

00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:15.880
 so I'm explaining the severity of the disease when she's pregnant we

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:23.210
 lot of guy there who had and gave nothing nor felt she did not ask for taste asked

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:31.210
 taste admiral benedict holding him from communication fabi wander through it that

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:44.360
 the minister france the beauty people at the age of 62 the prince the prince antónio right I

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:50.060
 I saw a publication of Dom Bertrand, almost 70 years old, with 67 and 68 years old

00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:56.050
 age also left the hospital today or yesterday he was there celebrating right

00:27:56.050 --> 00:28:01.990
 leaving the hospital I don't know sometimes it rains

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:07.120
 and sometimes the young guy is also healthy, my body fell

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:11.940
 can hold it there i will explain to you the interesting thing that is the question of

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:18.460
 antibody this is green was a test zinho

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:24.070
 system a tissue that is like pregnancy test hole the little finger puts the drop of

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:30.340
 blood and appears there are three for gray there appears the first dash for

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:36.970
 know if you really have a date reacting then you have hygiene and gg which is

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:49.040
 the are the antibodies right there i commented with eggs note told me port the wii gm

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:54.530
 and it’s like it’s a bouncer, then the disease came to your body the lion of

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:58.450
 farm is great you imagine the bar people are having a beer

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:02.880
 taking a cup starts a stick started the fight

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:06.630
 and then I ranchers beat the house of a colleague in the house of the other and

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:14.090
 to open the stopped it calls police the police o &amp; g is the police will identify

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:21.810
 thug will see if I spoke to identical to say what is the expensive fabric that lipe

00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:25.820
 this guy is not going to let him do it first I already identified

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:33.510
 so egma when you started with lulu cartridge disease appear that you're

00:29:33.510 --> 00:29:37.520
 which in you have the disease at that moment

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:43.570
 and if gmg shows up, you’ll see the mother’s disease is coming out of it you’ve created

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:49.940
 definitive they only have gg yes he has already had the disease so this guy who g

00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:54.340
 can circulate he doesn’t pick up from teaching passes a career

00:29:54.340 --> 00:30:00.039
 that's what they say if you take the exam and it should you are immune or you can

00:30:00.039 --> 00:30:04.960
 circulate here talking after sixty percent of the population sixty seventy

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:09.850
 percent of the population take sides watch to heal that is to say they will already have the

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:13.900
 antibodies act as a barrier, you know, the virus will not pass the stone

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:22.390
 got here and died and it's a natural barrier and then these

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:28.360
 yes there is a nose exam I want to send you right you don't brain it passes there and

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:35.170
 give your brain a nudge shot is it is horrible then I also did my brother

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:43.450
 he also did just that this one is fifty percent false positive or

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:47.130
 false-negative false-negative can I negative 1

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:53.130
 your [ __ ] lucchesi I don't have I don't have one but this one has

00:30:53.130 --> 00:31:00.390
 good so this is the same test of the chic room he also fake

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:05.180
 negative it does not give false positive more difficult it give false positive

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:08.990
 it is but it can give false negative so sometimes it takes negative but you

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:15.200
 try for a month you’re not feeling anything like you have a lot of cases so take it like that

00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:19.640
 85 percent of people it really does not think anything I didn’t feel

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:30.170
 nothing is characterizes corn disease at home 15 side only they useful today so it is

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:35.570
 really and here we go because you spoke the ideological question so said this is

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:40.310
 serious but for a small percentage of society, what they say

00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:48.320
 close the planet close the planet to ms ordered to close the planet is the most the

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:52.179
 others come on or not and no woman writes

00:31:52.179 --> 00:31:58.419
 the time I never saw close the homie has a pregnant woman are two daughters is

00:31:58.419 --> 00:32:03.970
 no problem the possible ms says that to cut a bizarre essential service

00:32:03.970 --> 00:32:15.399
 bizarre piston in a role of a one year pregnant woman because music caused

00:32:15.399 --> 00:32:20.400
 problems little children remember all microcephaly and

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:30.690
 and then nobody closed the planet except that the presidents were obama and no h1 n1 is the

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:36.630
 no but yeah you're a server today ok so come on when i can with the clear that

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:41.610
 in 2016 appeared on the globe I how do you see these things man I looked at

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:48.770
 that the guys comment feel a guy commenting on a video watch the video

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:53.750
 the art over there the guy had a regret watching the new video I can't give

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:57.460
 enjoy it all but I read a lot of demand

00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:03.350
 the internet law this video talking to the globe in 2016

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:09.770
 hi or of course a very promising corner in of course it acts the same way

00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:15.410
 that she responds to malaria looks like another place is far I didn't get the question of

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:19.389
 prevent the destruction of hemoglobin in the erythrocyte

00:33:19.389 --> 00:33:23.679
 hi and there it is good talking pull the medicine very promising and they speak interests

00:33:23.679 --> 00:33:30.159
 literally see hi can give to pregnant women without any problem the donkey no

00:33:30.159 --> 00:33:34.239
 it was a net, then a specialist appeared at that time, I shared it on my

00:33:34.239 --> 00:33:38.829
 on my son who wants to see it on instagram on youtube on facebook after

00:33:38.829 --> 00:33:44.220
 take a look at this interesting video here 15 quilts to trade

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:48.740
 and then dude you find a lot of things

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:56.420
 is one of the now dancing here right too until the little that comes in the invitation

00:33:56.420 --> 00:34:03.860
 when he arrived at the invitation until the invitation when he had the h1 n1 anvisa did a

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:12.950
 protocol I made an ordinance letting the tamiflu insert insert that the remedy

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:18.110
 could be used exceptionally for an epidemic emergency even without

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:23.150
 public scientific study and depending on the leading edge evident

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:26.780
 which is your doctor who will tell you if you took no

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:32.030
 oh but this is obvious we would never say otherwise but here comes the middle of speech

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:37.130
 so no you have to wait for a publication when there was h1 n1 nobody

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:42.350
 waited for treatment application then look for it then say it so let's put

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:49.550
 on the street, a doctor can do it, since we are seeing an emergency, we can't today

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:54.380
 also did it today but I can't why I can't today you want to close the

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:58.190
 plan I even had in this story of a

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:04.160
 spectrum report the english newspaper and spoke of iceland he spoke like this to

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:11.240
 the economy they are saying that it is life versus money economy then they said no

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:19.540
 is life versus life if you for economics and then I saw this yesterday cases of suicide

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:25.490
 cases of depression lot of face up so much magic increase in the number of

00:35:25.490 --> 00:35:29.580
 domestic aggressions against women, right during the period of confinement also

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:34.550
 [Music] you cause internal conflict not to stay in

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:40.070
 home cannot work and he gets food where it’s going to become food doesn’t stay in

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:48.980
 home and you see a lot of arts and chopping and then there's a wine man plays

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:56.620
 so take the journalist's son I'm telling him what he did is like

00:35:56.620 --> 00:36:06.250
 chin eats cold there is a girl washing the dishes of the girl there taking her

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:15.190
 little dick right and then you look man I hear the card here I watch the photo is

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:22.210
 a litany the rain speech comes from outside speech comes from outside I need to think

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:26.260
 which is clearly also your personal personal sign from abroad, you know, it's just

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:31.390
 politician john some other means of communication and it's always like that is

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:36.910
 impressive because it’s funny that people outside this truth they say

00:36:36.910 --> 00:36:42.190
 that we are chromatic and that we are poetizing against the truth

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:46.090
 recent past they took the same steps

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:50.740
 I'm talking about reducing the emergency of medications that in the emergency have to

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:54.340
 take the medicine you better take medicines that you don't have a study

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:59.470
 proving that it is effective but that it can save your life there now they

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:03.720
 change the course today not now you can't use the medicine you have to die

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:08.650
 but you cannot use the medicine that has no proven scientific study then

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:13.750
 so it’s a business that stands out from the ground, then it’s going to match at the end by

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:19.900
 example some videos that we are seeing of ordinary citizens, right in situations

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:24.150
 totally random so wrong programmed programmed the cases

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:29.470
 disgusted with the globe, right? I watched a video of a woman sitting at the club

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:33.560
 in a journalist because she was filming her car license plate on you

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:38.540
 a helper talking to a guy with his ass like that, finding what filming everyone

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:44.000
 like I'm doing a test to screw you and the woman really so much the other was

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:49.850
 took come with the journalism phone to speak look the good soldier was right

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:54.560
 don't know what is trash globe people is not that people not the judge of

00:37:54.560 --> 00:38:00.170
 communication some of them don't understand that doing this kind of thing they

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:04.870
 they are fraying they are pulling the Brazilian's patience by limit

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:10.880
 because what my eyes see is that the truth is that reality

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.930
 but they insist on saying what I wanted in the eyes comes is not reality a

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:19.130
 reality is what the globe put on my head so like a wash

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:25.160
 brain so wide open and playing still playing without nearly killing people

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:29.750
 why is it not possible today the sheet of são paulo was already there wanting to play in

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:33.570
 account of the president, right, the question of unemployment when you grow up

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:39.840
 I'm talking about this question, yes, it’s an excuse for my outburst and I’m going back one

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:43.350
 a little bit here for the question of your explanation even though it is not being

00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:50.310
 given the doctor what did you say the lung it ends up fibrosan du does total

00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:57.060
 sense for what the infectologist dr paolo zanotto tia form that

00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:02.010
 he even has the pastor he has another side and let's go he has dubbed in oxford

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:05.250
 the 90s, right, you're talking about one of the most highly regarded universities

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:10.200
 of the world he says that hydroxychloroquine has to be applied

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:15.300
 at the beginning of the video color because because if not afterwards from the fourth fifth

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:20.340
 sixth day will happen the card said your peacock will be fibrous and not

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:24.150
 no use you no fan inhaling and exhaling doing your

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:28.940
 lung function and if you don't have the cells to

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:32.360
 take that oxygen into your body will throw it in the front so

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:35.990
 he says it has to be applied exactly at the beginning

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:42.050
 while your dresser is able to take oxygen and get treated right to see

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:47.870
 his body and I conclude by saying that the cell that there was makes the virus he

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:53.660
 enter your cell because it uses your cell, right?

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:59.420
 uses the cell to feed on the mitochondria and etc. and the aline will go stay

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:04.040
 for the next infected cell the flame on the side does the same procedure so there is

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:07.850
 to be applied exactly at the beginning the curtain while your cologne have

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:13.430
 condition of taking the oxygen and treating yourself, you know, to give your body and finish

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:17.609
 saying that it is the cell that that the body does the

00:40:17.609 --> 00:40:24.539
 virus it enters your cell because it uses your cell, you know

00:40:24.539 --> 00:40:27.140
 uses

00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:33.319
 and the cell to feed on mitochondria etc and aline will go mica

00:40:33.319 --> 00:40:37.219
 for next infected cell by the side does same procedure is still

00:40:37.219 --> 00:40:44.119
 ready what that cocktail of azithromycin hydroxychloroquine and then

00:40:44.119 --> 00:40:49.190
 simple vitamin c anyway what do you do when zika when when invite enters

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:53.900
 in your cell it kills your cell’s food ie when that cell

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:59.750
 infected dies she dies jun and with the invitation 19 so when 19

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:05.600
 dies there and has no chance of going to the other cells then and to the

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:14.090
 critical expansion this is what actually happens right but arthur your

00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:19.010
 education minister brother I recently lived a video of him is with

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:24.740
 several clipping from the globe trying to interview him and going out etc. for

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:29.090
 that they don’t like yours because the globe doesn’t like your family I love you

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:33.590
 but for the good for São Paulo sheet to the cold brothers I see that they

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:40.460
 cheer for her still wrong they cheer and make fun of it is up to you anyway

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:44.069
 you are doing here there wasn’t I wasn’t enjoying the globe

00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:52.930
 and I the rosana if a the Martian of the planet and

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:58.990
 like if you want it right what is it just look what you want from the front that the media

00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:08.520
 do and do the inverse the inverse is always the same Manichean the globe the marine

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:21.940
 cold marine is the media this great media you you know very well your

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:25.740
 dad he said like that to me or my brother turned me on her whenever you can

00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:30.769
 you help your brother good so much that the accessory your

00:42:30.769 --> 00:42:35.180
 father even telling him that it's happening, right, it's good for me sometimes

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:38.599
 participates in a meeting with my brother from the president he has the guy from

00:42:38.599 --> 00:42:44.059
 marias serves arthur weintraub participating only in meetings with his brother

00:42:44.059 --> 00:42:48.589
 him in the plateau palace [ __ ] on the bench I participate my brother I'm

00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:54.270
 participating with my chief president hi and then we talk about the good projects

00:42:54.270 --> 00:43:00.540
 that what is being commented on and what you see clearly is the following is the

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:05.820
 same thing as the invitation they say he did nothing he has nothing i deliver

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:10.570
 nothing that shows a lot of things that was ugly a lot of things that was

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:17.140
 and there will not even be the kingdom there made the enemy cuts thirty percent doors from thirty

00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:22.660
 percent had no cut had cut yet put another 250 million had no

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:27.880
 cut voted yet money everything they say it does not go to how much it gives yes

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:32.560
 won't have they'll do it wrong it doesn't happen they don't say after he

00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:38.950
 there was one that the globe even talked about took a criminal vacation he was entitled

00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:43.360
 the fever after they are eight minutes talking that it was criminal and probity

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:47.920
 administrative later with me to change we missed our subscribers but there is no

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:53.540
 transplant in which the firms went and and and now there is the last lie so

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:59.690
 we got there he doesn't have a template he doesn't have a toothpick he is a teacher

00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:05.000
 federal university of são paulo professor professor professor minister

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:10.130
 education where he was PT, the doctor was minister of economics where the plague of

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:17.780
 medical view is the minister of the economy when the PT doctor is PT and

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:24.619
 minister of the economy and the economist psd view minister of health no one speaks

00:44:24.619 --> 00:44:29.470
 nothing on that side and then my brother who is a teacher and

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:34.020
 little his classes he was a disputable

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:41.010
 I never had any complaints you can search there on the contrary it is only in java

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:47.210
 have proof of my classes and my brother's class 20 years old man now 20 years since

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:52.440
 99/2000 and then seriously, he has no leather no

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:56.700
 there is a greenhouse the leaf even made fun when we see the tablet we

00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:02.960
 eat in the form he had no boy and I the guy for pf there you pay then

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:08.660
 I ate rice and beans and said we eat the flower written like this not central and eating

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:16.310
 french fries rice beans in the very different kid's popular restaurant pt that

00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:21.290
 eat exquisite places like this, leaving it as if we were going

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:27.410
 still do not do but it is only one are really can even call equal president

00:45:27.410 --> 00:45:31.550
 of the voice that comes back stronger than remembered guys we will see a relative here only

00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:34.760
 to relax in this bowl because we talk, we're talking

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:38.650
 pandemic hydroxychloroquine its subject that even stressful because

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:42.619
 certainly these four thousand more people are watching us now that I

00:45:42.619 --> 00:45:46.700
 see if you have an infected relative but it was funny as soon as my father's

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:49.700
 president his first international civilian was to face the

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:54.530
 switzerland where home the goal the economic forum took place right the world forum of

00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:57.319
 economy and there

00:45:57.319 --> 00:46:04.969
 I went out to dinner, right, someone took the president to the enchanted place

00:46:04.969 --> 00:46:10.459
 so to say right with a slightly more expensive wine a more elaborate food

00:46:10.459 --> 00:46:16.459
 much promises a name buffet it certain things that only appreciated and

00:46:16.459 --> 00:46:20.959
 legitimately appreciated by people who call with a higher standard of living than

00:46:20.959 --> 00:46:25.579
 there is no problem with that ok people have no merit in this but how to see

00:46:25.579 --> 00:46:29.850
 the account I remember here in my head was something

00:46:29.850 --> 00:46:34.890
 i want to open a car it was good to capture an account when the president looked at that

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:39.630
 asked the bill and the waiter told him how much it cost he gave a

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:45.300
 jump just like this each one will pay yours doesn’t have to pay I don’t know I don’t even know

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:49.230
 how will it be macadam will pay your falls all ministers right everybody

00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:53.130
 there passing card machine everybody button card paying paying your

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:59.430
 your own dinner, which was very expensive, right?

00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:05.870
 the president did were have lunch I wanted to take him to a high-level place

00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:10.620
 none of that looked to the side and safely there the guy ends up driving wash

00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:15.990
 the car where are they hiding here oh no we can not have a tray

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:19.440
 here on the side we don’t start eating there black good to eat there we go

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:24.660
 and we’re going to eat in this beauty beauty tray there they went when the

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:29.040
 president served himself at the bandejão who he ate a lot of journalists there

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:33.599
 together, right, he served in the tray and sat down to eat, he was the first

00:47:33.599 --> 00:47:38.269
 hit the table and take a picture what are you going to

00:47:38.269 --> 00:47:43.640
 communication jair you hope it's the following is [ __ ] dude it's just a president

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:48.739
 that preaches austerity and practice a trinity a president who is

00:47:48.739 --> 00:47:52.749
 accustomed to a standard of living that is much closer to that of most Brazilians

00:47:52.749 --> 00:47:58.119
 than close to the millionaires trapped in the jet wash not what you want in the newspaper

00:47:58.119 --> 00:48:03.619
 president bolsonaro is isolated in the g20 type of hairstyle and forced to eat

00:48:03.619 --> 00:48:07.849
 alone in the trough is the same thing that happened happened to

00:48:07.849 --> 00:48:13.429
 you, right, they demeaning you, saying look, there's no class, I'm not

00:48:13.429 --> 00:48:17.239
 at the time of the liturgy of the post there are 20 articles that I found on the street and now they are

00:48:17.239 --> 00:48:21.439
 minister right instead of saying exactly the opposite are people concerned with

00:48:21.439 --> 00:48:26.089
 public money people who have the salary and an income that they don't loose

00:48:26.089 --> 00:48:32.209
 but they also can't eat fine food every day

00:48:32.209 --> 00:48:39.929
 so press when she does that is what ends up wearing out right

00:48:39.929 --> 00:48:43.769
 a situation is happy we would not like that to happen

00:48:43.769 --> 00:48:49.859
 I would like to have a political maturity and a balanced national scenario where

00:48:49.859 --> 00:48:54.929
 you could actually debate but nowadays you’re going to beat it

00:48:54.929 --> 00:48:59.279
 company judging you down to you is against something there the guy over there

00:48:59.279 --> 00:49:03.089
 appetite she say that you are a break that you are racist there is no way you can have

00:49:03.089 --> 00:49:07.169
 debate on that the name of oak speaks we can’t stay all the time

00:49:07.169 --> 00:49:11.759
 speaking look i'm not racist don't speak i'm not macho not [ __ ] it is

00:49:11.759 --> 00:49:16.979
 why she will end up cursing right is it because you have no way of hitting the

00:49:16.979 --> 00:49:25.739
 guy who's talking to you for you to discuss and it's unfortunate that

00:49:25.739 --> 00:49:30.840
 that came in strongly at our universities too, right?

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:34.740
 and as a teacher andré if you can you can even talk a little better about this

00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:40.170
 theme and if you want to develop the question of harassment of teachers or

00:49:40.170 --> 00:49:46.020
 students you right-wing the ban on making theses that criticize focused on

00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:50.430
 calm down with all these people if you can talk a little bit about it

00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:56.550
 and I see the following bible guy talks about demon caste we see today

00:49:56.550 --> 00:50:02.730
 situation so I just saw some people write here you will

00:50:02.730 --> 00:50:08.940
 seeing the vast majority of them dirtying your mother has already appeared and the queiroz doesn’t

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:16.400
 it seems like some of them, I don’t know, they say we’re just that

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:24.359
 university is what I so I didn't I didn't believe it I knew that great

00:50:24.359 --> 00:50:32.579
 exists there when I was on top it was already good it was always left victim

00:50:32.579 --> 00:50:38.870
 social the nap I'm a social victim the punch his son he dropped

00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:47.880
 French baby crap is I do it guys new French is

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:52.140
 I do that, it's just a know, you don't read it, I remember that I call the social contract of the

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:56.519
 south speak to usp professor professor his speaks here in

00:50:56.519 --> 00:51:02.099
 magistrates he is not no I was not mistaken person is quoting but there is a

00:51:02.099 --> 00:51:09.420
 central brain of ideas launch there I started what to say great for

00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:12.569
 this is where things arrive international I went to give a lecture in the rest of

00:51:12.569 --> 00:51:17.640
 Chile many years ago many years ago I arrived in the classroom and the students came to speak

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:21.809
 for me there we didn't get a lot of brazil because of the socialism of brazil as it is

00:51:21.809 --> 00:51:27.390
 which is because there you have free and quality public university the same

00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:32.880
 phrase the same litany dude hi and then i went to canada teacher

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:37.920
 from the university of canada just talking about gender ideology the very envy

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:41.090
 Brazil because of socialism to go again

00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:49.210
 the guy you travel the world so the universities were behind communist

00:51:49.210 --> 00:51:54.160
 good and you get to the university you have thirty percent who is not a communist

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:59.200
 but how do they take care is like a baleiro my eye arrives at the university

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:04.510
 so this one starts to smooth, there are their main courses there, these courses of

00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:10.600
 sociology philosophy where it accumulates more history and then they start to get the

00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:15.490
 collegiate so they know how to hunt read they’re going to get a room get a

00:52:15.490 --> 00:52:19.780
 whale they see the collegiate they do a meeting I was the coordinator of the course

00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:24.940
 actuarial sciences at the federal university of são paulo i could not stand the

00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:31.360
 sir it is not 8 hours of meeting then there was a partner no union partner

00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:36.310
 nothing is decided i had to work man i'm not exclusive dedication i

00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:39.540
 never went to dedicate yourself you were twice as much slave 1

00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:50.760
 and as a department teacher this can be a union site they come back this apert

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:56.250
 it’s a human being that collegiate is all over the world if you’re not

00:52:56.250 --> 00:53:02.300
 communist you start to be chased you start with the guys posting thing is

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:09.690
 look ugly there on the edge begins to suffer processinhos process river suffer

00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:14.780
 confidential administrative process in which I underwent the sectorial rosicky process

00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:21.480
 literally be you you took to an education commission the threat that is

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:25.140
 in my car death message let's throw the brick in the head if it binds that the

00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:30.540
 people are going to kill you I had no security at all I just got university security

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:37.910
 spoke I didn't understand you said violence comes from both parts luciano brother

00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:44.780
 and me that you notice that it happens all over the world then say yes or no but it's just

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:51.410
 university of humanities and starts to see professor of medicine, right, communist, expensive

00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:57.039
 queuing professor of communist physics mathematics you baby within the courses

00:53:57.039 --> 00:54:03.109
 they put there physical knowledge of Brazilian reality is anthropology

00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:09.380
 philosophy and in these classes they start to get people or sometimes even

00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:14.539
 way in an explicit way, right, I take it to my wife to be erased

00:54:14.539 --> 00:54:18.740
 heloísa at her college was a private university in rio grande do

00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:24.460
 south right in 2016 during the impeachment process there was a class worth noting

00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:30.170
 about the 2016 coup and in the back wallet a little table

00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:35.660
 buriti right about democracy at risk brazil when i am getting married is not the

00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:40.700
 democracy post citizen constitution 78 and when to get there to attend class who

00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:46.369
 there is the representative of the mst that you think she will speak to you is a

00:54:46.369 --> 00:54:51.200
 totally biased business and you don't have the same if you had a guy from

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:56.329
 left and a guy on the right all right could even have a business a more

00:54:56.329 --> 00:55:01.460
 balanced on john couldn’t my money too i love you too but the

00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:06.140
 their democracy is as follows they do not give space to the right any none

00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:12.680
 right I think it would be good if Brazil had conservative universities to

00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:18.800
 start fighting it and they will then so when they slept the

00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:23.810
 democracy so you can be olrox leninist this so this is the one that

00:55:23.810 --> 00:55:28.200
 democracy is the one that democracy the democracy of these guys approved

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:36.180
 if you participated in did some testimonials for people from brazil

00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:40.170
 parallel that made the documentary homeland educator before documentary that was

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:45.119
 released the weeklong thing the box I always recommend are three episodes

00:55:45.119 --> 00:55:50.190
 first episode talking about the history of university formation etc. the second

00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:55.050
 they dissect who was paulo freire and in the third they show the story

00:55:55.050 --> 00:55:59.190
 recent education including testimony from your brother, right at the beginning

00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:05.520
 abraham weintraub showing some cases of corruption recommends how is the

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:09.870
 your your ironing part will glue now I recommend it is

00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:19.590
 the argument simply everything from brazil forever without i watched i put it on

00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:28.680
 my twitter and and even had a call mia in case that was what I said had

00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:34.410
 had medical school removed the nephrology chair put the doctor

00:56:34.410 --> 00:56:40.560
 of the family they are getting unlucky then I mentioned a case of a teacher who told you

00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:47.300
 to face her right to chat away I used to meet the people who

00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:51.660
 talked in is not like them from the moment you are not mine

00:56:51.660 --> 00:56:57.390
 you have to be a lot, I told her how are you, how are you

00:56:57.390 --> 00:57:04.790
 her husband say here are her teeth she will person my look will be more

00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:11.880
 I do not allow you and I went up to dedicate your calm like that

00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:15.900
 it was all possible dude it's not possible if i hadn't seen it i wouldn't believe it

00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:22.770
 and so in the university it happens more is in your people you can already see

00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:28.650
 people like that oh this talking business is what we have to thank a lot

00:57:28.650 --> 00:57:34.710
 to your father your father if it weren't for him we wouldn't be having this

00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:38.970
 possibility to say that now you think we would be able to fish

00:57:38.970 --> 00:57:46.950
 rightly charges many things but your father was stabbed and we can

00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:53.790
 because of him, today, speaking here, there are authoritarian people shivering there in the

00:57:53.790 --> 00:57:58.170
 brazil rihanna taking the constitution guy throwing it in the sewer here look here look

00:57:58.170 --> 00:58:04.430
 article 5 causes the squeeze only one piece fundamental rights right to drive

00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:08.110
 right to express oneself by right of religion

00:58:08.110 --> 00:58:13.750
 oh no you can't go to your service because ms he you want to do a

00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:18.820
 something like that make one of the constitution who has the prerogative to do that is the

00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:23.890
 your father your father who could decree state of siege and state of defense that of

00:58:23.890 --> 00:58:28.630
 war to be able to make a restrictive measure of fundamental right but

00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:34.510
 have gone through the republic's spending council by the national congress one says the

00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:40.140
 constitution here o perfect perfect look your father ahead and if you can

00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:46.690
 turn the situation around imagine that you had to decree the growth of everything and

00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:52.060
 there vs the mayor of said so i don't agree here in mine now i think

00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:58.750
 it doesn't have to be like that and letting go

00:58:58.750 --> 00:59:06.430
 mayor yes I am very dichotomous it is totally what you see in education there

00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:08.120
 with my brother and my brother is getting older in front of me

00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:14.480
 and today his white hair we go but people say like this he is your father

00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:19.460
 guys sign up is he is the minister's son the same years and a half but he was the

00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:27.290
 that I four and a half years he 7876 and he's old man the guy works he

00:59:27.290 --> 00:59:36.990
 it works there like this is 12 hours a day but it is for nothing agreed is

00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:42.060
 and will have to do it like this I don't know look around and there is no one who will

00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:45.840
 do you man have to do your father if the paulinho around talking has to

00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:53.400
 do it is me and a group from january the small group you see us is because

00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:59.340
 it takes a lot to beat too, so people have to be a teacher who doesn’t

00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:04.740
 want to appear in clothes mouths how many contacts have already been made I’m not

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:10.369
 passing this but let's go crazy flawed here for not because you know that if

01:00:10.369 --> 01:00:16.710
 done is something public against this militancy on the present left

01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:21.990
 university present in newspaper editorials and etc. the guy will suffer will

01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:25.890
 suffer arthur is talking to us he is the brother of minister abraham

01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:30.180
 weintraub were the two took lawsuits when he spoke process

01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:36.350
 secrecy but I wanted to finish something

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:41.609
 and for which it was the governor who most directly violated article 5 of our

01:00:41.609 --> 01:00:47.460
 constitution you saw that the stf right Minister alexandre de moraes of a

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:53.310
 decision saying that it is up to mayors and governors to say is how will this be

01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:58.650
 confinement his next direction the mayor of mirandópolis everton sodário

01:00:58.650 --> 01:01:04.680
 wanted to open the trade and dória forced him to close the trade, right and

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:07.650
 when the president's statement towards the dollar and several sense

01:01:07.650 --> 01:01:11.970
 otherwise so oh glory he really he’s right he’s having a

01:01:11.970 --> 01:01:20.430
 power that even the kings many times in the past didn’t, he closed everything spoke

01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:24.049
 here look now i'm going to use your cell phone without your consent to

01:01:24.049 --> 01:01:29.869
 well then person the governor of look he was thinking he can do what

01:01:29.869 --> 01:01:34.910
 well understand that really arthur put it makes sense if we think that

01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:39.679
 President Jair Bolsonaro had television interviews saying he will

01:01:39.679 --> 01:01:43.910
 arrest people who leave home imagine how it is not being the

01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:48.170
 repercussion in the press, you know, the press that only thinks about freedom because the

01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:53.329
 president jair bolsonaro you take his chain right the post said that

01:01:53.329 --> 01:01:58.729
 I wanted to control the media, control the press, you know?

01:01:58.729 --> 01:02:02.329
 also remember that one of the first actions of the gula largo government in 2003 in

01:02:02.329 --> 01:02:08.839
 his first year in office was the disarmament statute approved on the basis of

01:02:08.839 --> 01:02:13.789
 of a lot of money poured into the monthly allowance for deputies at the time to vote

01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:18.829
 in favor of these measures, it’s worth remembering that in 2016 during the process of

01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:24.059
 impeachment then you cultivate pt national made a letter a resolution

01:02:24.059 --> 01:02:30.319
 and saying that it leads to dilma's mistakes and the pt was not to have selected better

01:02:30.319 --> 01:02:35.939
 those they promoted as is the generals the high command of the forces

01:02:35.939 --> 01:02:43.349
 armed right and certainly the now Argentine that you detect but he a

01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:47.160
 news more at the beginning of the year when president abel alberto fernandes was

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:50.759
 thinking of sending the project to the national congress for just

01:02:50.759 --> 01:02:57.059
 control the armed forces by appointing a political sensor to which generals

01:02:57.059 --> 01:03:02.789
 should ask for a pension in the case of promoting someone or a blessing in the case of

01:03:02.789 --> 01:03:09.509
 armed forces want to do a special mission anyway they will

01:03:09.509 --> 01:03:14.579
 learned from their mistakes and we will make sure that the next time they

01:03:14.579 --> 01:03:21.449
 come to power do not repeat these mistakes in their heads right understand if I

01:03:21.449 --> 01:03:26.770
 everything that prevents listening and the supreme intelligent power to arm the

01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:32.530
 population if they wanted to enforce the use of force they just need to have a

01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:39.930
 troop in favor of him, which is what he has there in venezuela the mature he counts on

01:03:39.930 --> 01:03:44.050
 Cuban soldiers he has the Bolivarian national guard who was

01:03:44.050 --> 01:03:50.520
 created this is promoted whoever said hello hugo chavez now live mature right

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:57.520
 promoted to the high echelon generals colonels people who did not have the

01:03:57.520 --> 01:04:02.110
 military training ie did not follow the hierarchy and the normal course of the career

01:04:02.110 --> 01:04:05.650
 military to get you to the top of your career so they took the hand of

01:04:05.650 --> 01:04:09.370
 unionist a lot of corrupt a lot of people who played the game together

01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:14.920
 with them and put them there to command the armed forces and that comes to such a point

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:20.050
 when the population is hungry and has no way of reacting, they have to ask for help

01:04:20.050 --> 01:04:24.049
 international governments are the beauty and we will already have around there

01:04:24.049 --> 01:04:28.939
 millions who have left the country are living in many of them or in america of the

01:04:28.939 --> 01:04:34.429
 south or the united states and some of them already have more hope than the country

01:04:34.429 --> 01:04:38.809
 can go back to how it was before I still have hope I think not

01:04:38.809 --> 01:04:43.759
 there is evil that lasts forever but we believe that that day that day will

01:04:43.759 --> 01:04:49.670
 god wants to get there in Brazil dictatorship who is from são paulo saturday that

01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:56.119
 I'm talking absurd, the owner is even managing to make one again

01:04:56.119 --> 01:05:01.309
 union between libertarians and conservatives along the lines of what happened against

01:05:01.309 --> 01:05:07.249
 dilma's impeachment in 2016 there had already been hate haunts yesterday I received a video

01:05:07.249 --> 01:05:12.229
 I will pull here a little motorcade against the dollar thing that the press a

01:05:12.229 --> 01:05:16.880
 much of it did not disclose but if it was for the motorcade to get bolsonaro

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:21.170
 would be in the four corners of the country with great mega event of rejection jair

01:05:21.170 --> 01:05:24.059
 bolsonaro as they had the guts to say it was

01:05:24.059 --> 01:05:28.319
 yes it is and the game is being played you are

01:05:28.319 --> 01:05:32.279
 seeing that what is happening the president cannot do everything but the

01:05:32.279 --> 01:05:40.589
 people will also have the opportunity to give their message to those dictators who

01:05:40.589 --> 01:05:44.430
 are trying to avoid protests they purposely say they can't do

01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:48.989
 motorcade that there can be no lighting and etc. also preventing people from

01:05:48.989 --> 01:05:54.959
 protest on the internet we see more and more reaping our reach profiles

01:05:54.959 --> 01:05:58.439
 overthrown by joaquim teixeira that the profile of a motive overturned a zillion

01:05:58.439 --> 01:06:03.569
 sometimes several others, right, the bolsonaro type, the bolsonaro zuero person who

01:06:03.569 --> 01:06:08.549
 nor are there several, in short, several of them who did not return after successive

01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:13.319
 overturned and it’s always like that, right, a chase here doesn’t say the booklet

01:06:13.319 --> 01:06:16.799
 of them because he thinks he is more intelligent than others they

01:06:16.799 --> 01:06:22.709
 think it right and he went so far as to do it, right, that journalist from

01:06:22.709 --> 01:06:28.690
 globonews in which she ditches rap I went to complain, not to say right

01:06:28.690 --> 01:06:32.799
 look you will show the copacabana you arrive at the copacabana palace shows the

01:06:32.799 --> 01:06:36.519
 closing also of the trade my friend of the toninho that gave restaurant I think that

01:06:36.519 --> 01:06:41.709
 in the center of the river or in copacabana I don’t know and then the auctioneer answers

01:06:41.709 --> 01:06:46.029
 your friend Toninho's trade there is as important as copacabana's economy

01:06:46.029 --> 01:06:51.099
 from the river if it is, we show it, that is, she is underestimating, she is talking like this, I am not even

01:06:51.099 --> 01:06:56.109

01:07:00.999 --> 01:07:06.999
 population go to they have scorned opinion she she showed very well the

01:07:06.999 --> 01:07:11.979
 language opportunity to say how the band plays inside the globe news right

01:07:11.979 --> 01:07:17.349
 is part of the globe group obviously but I don't care for your opinion

01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:20.829
 these newspapers if I think the magalhães sail that I have been quarantining

01:07:20.829 --> 01:07:28.489
 eating cheese you there what about and the parma ham be it ok

01:07:28.489 --> 01:07:33.920
 drinking French wine I probably don’t know if she’s worried that the guy

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:38.660
 there the uncle of the Styrofoam with the uncle who sells the dogão da corner that the guys

01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:42.859
 how and after football do you think you're worried ladder

01:07:42.859 --> 01:07:47.569
 folks these folks who are guaranteed their weekend and are just getting into

01:07:47.569 --> 01:07:50.929
 the beating in the government says that the government wants to put the economy above health

01:07:50.929 --> 01:07:56.359
 when anyone who has a qi language knows that it doesn’t exist that they are

01:07:56.359 --> 01:08:00.349
 two problems have to be dealt with simultaneously, he doesn't care

01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:05.089
 for you and the guys his is guaranteed maybe maybe he will

01:08:05.089 --> 01:08:09.890
 be aware of a shortage when her employee

01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:14.029
 go to the market to buy French wine I didn't even have French or when I go to buy

01:08:14.029 --> 01:08:18.679
 what when when buying the cheese she wants not to get the cheese on the market

01:08:18.679 --> 01:08:25.500
 then it will get real, but stick it out, you can notice

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:32.850
 the newspapers are already starting to attack on the account of president jair bolsonaro to

01:08:32.850 --> 01:08:38.130
 is the question of the economy, right, there’s leaf material, there’s uol material and others

01:08:38.130 --> 01:08:43.550
 newspapers starting to pull this way not even a week ago there was a

01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:49.320
 a collective in which dória was present and another collective even in rio de janeiro

01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:53.220
 governor wilson 20 i say the following look we hope the government

01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:57.140
 federal government to comply with its obligations to send money to that state

01:08:57.140 --> 01:09:02.580
 the ears on the stick guy just closed the contract transparency

01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:07.020
 because we know i'm reading comments you do here it's just a lot

01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:11.840
 people talking here about the inspection of this money that the government

01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:18.830
 a lot of people talking about the inspection of this money that is sent to

01:09:18.830 --> 01:09:23.780
 states the federal government it has already put down more than 600 billion there in the

01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:30.440
 fight the coronavirus ok has a r $ 600 corona voucher is guaranteed by whose

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:35.180
 earns salaries earn up to two minimum wages and works a small or medium

01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:41.660
 company so that a boss has the breath to be able to keep the job of that

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:47.330
 his employee's server has several other measures that are

01:09:47.330 --> 01:09:51.470
 being made out beyond obviously the question of internship construction

01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:58.430
 We know that the hospitals campaign is not at the perfect ideal level because the

01:09:58.430 --> 01:10:01.550
 government also has its limitations it is difficult for you to deal with the public machine

01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:05.450
 she is totally excessive private cristina we have people said

01:10:05.450 --> 01:10:09.020
 private with paulo guedes will kill me who are now inside the machine

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:14.090
 public and they are the best people even to make this comparison for

01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:16.800
 tell the limitations that a person who

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:23.460
 public servant has up to you by law the citizen he can do everything except that it is

01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:27.480
 prohibited by law can meditate my audience to the contrary he cannot do

01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:34.350
 nothing except what is foreseen in the law with what is allowed but the government has done the

01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:39.630
 part of them and in this video money for governors a lot of people in this

01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:45.630
 respected right by the river so you notice and I and I invite you with a reflection o

01:10:45.630 --> 01:10:52.920
 guy who steals right is money that should be will not be the pandemic he will

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:57.390
 create awareness he will create with you to associate and will say hi oh no

01:10:57.390 --> 01:11:02.130
 really that in health problems people can die this guy is not

01:11:02.130 --> 01:11:08.130
 sanding for a long time now but it's up to the inspection bodies to stay on top

01:11:08.130 --> 01:11:13.050
 because we know that now we are prioritizing speed over speed

01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:17.050
 so that the citizen has and the best possible treatment for

01:11:17.050 --> 01:11:21.880
 save his life so with that you end up flexing some others

01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:25.650
 norms but that doesn’t mean saying you’re going to be eternal impunity

01:11:25.650 --> 01:11:30.940
 to pass this inspection to the academy, yes, we will have time for capitalization

01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:35.650
 be effective and audit all that has been spent to find out if

01:11:35.650 --> 01:11:39.940
 there was an irregularity to know if any deviation occurs and I finish

01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:45.429
 this live with another one another perspective for you who are of

01:11:45.429 --> 01:11:52.030
 several states in brazil the governor of his state he made the federal government

01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:58.540
 that reduced the ipi reduce the import tax zeroed the taxation for

01:11:58.540 --> 01:12:03.489
 materials related to combating the 19 lair with the vitamin from below

01:12:03.489 --> 01:12:07.449
 of others we are president jair bolsonaro got from india inputs

01:12:07.449 --> 01:12:12.610

01:12:12.610 --> 01:12:17.060
 not crazy he is here in the crazy thing is not going to work

01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:20.620
 present you are caught in danger in things that have no scientific basis

01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:24.650
 will we apologize now, will the governors now

01:12:24.650 --> 01:12:30.830
 are going to say ah their also taxes the icms on food for example for

01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:34.280
 to reach the population in a cheaper way at that specific moment

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:38.949
 that the state government are getting that kind of expense

01:12:38.949 --> 01:12:44.650
