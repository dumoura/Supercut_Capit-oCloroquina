 having this subject here is not ok love can more importantly today a job

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:32.810
 huge yours from the ministry of onix dataprev economy various ministries

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:40.520
 involved was this $ 600 emergency relief for informal or

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.979
 freelancers among others says something had a record of how much when you

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.909
 opened home for staff to register the access record was

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:58.520
 destabilized the Brazilian internet network of everything we had in the first

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:09.280
 day that was on Tuesday 111 million hits in 6 hours on the site and 21

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.290
 million Brazilians register for the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:21.240
 app never heard sounds until today president we reached 30 million

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:29.340
 registrations and 270 million accesses on the site, just one thing that is important for

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:39.080
 avoid fraud there is only one help site ponto Caixa.gov.br and one application

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.959
 emergency emergency aid box federal government so these are the

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:52.920
 only two and a 111 telephone exchange had two northeastern states

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.980
 what I cannot accuse the governor there may be something money made by a

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.599
 any person but coincidentally from the northeastern state the two most

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.700
 to the northeast that on a website was a state government, this is a fraud

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.860
 all right so i'm not going to use the governor right you because we don't have the

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.400
 proof that was made by the governor but the way to prove that I will likely

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:25.080
 to show that the governor managed to get $ 600 to do well and today we pay

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:31.950
 because it is very important for more than two and a half million people who have already

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:40.260
 today received 2.1 million in savings bank accounts and 400 thousand from the bank of the

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.390
 brazil this is the first group the president group of people who are in the

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.750
 unique registration outside Bolsa Família and that passed through the first screen of the

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.030
 dataprev and yours also a second time week that

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.739
 it comes with all certainty I am in the family allowance and it was even for the guy wins 200

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:08.470
 family scholarship degrees will move to 600 1200 or 1800 are three groups i think

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.760
 that are a very important point the first is the single registration outside the

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:19.389
 family allowance which are around 10 million people we have the others

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:26.560
 payments between tuesday and wednesday next week we will also have is more than

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:34.479
 20 million people from the family allowance that we will pay on the normal day of 16 until the

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:40.210
 end of the month and fill registration which is what we are doing this week

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.060
 for informal workers who are informal workers the

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.639
 individual microentrepreneurs and also self-employed workers so it is the

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:57.350
 biggest program and if last point of insertion of people

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:04.430
 because 30 million Brazilians will have a free hand account an account

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.170
 digital in the savings box this was never done to cross it there it is on the screen

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:15.740
 here at the front a decision by the minister of the supreme federal court and went to the

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.080
 positive side that will appeal but your positive side until you say clearly

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:28.010
 that whoever is responsible for actions such as imposing distance and

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:34.520
 quarantine social isolation suspension of activities you who are not working

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:42.230
 right as well as classes on trade restrictions, cultural activities and the circulation of

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:47.849
 people whose governor or mayor decides this

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:55.279
 moved away from federal government that make decisions accordingly ok so the

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:59.569
 responsibility if you have a problem tested think the quarantine

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:06.179
 the measures taken by the in your state are undermining the appropriate forum

00:06:06.179 --> 00:06:10.740
 you complain will repeat the respective mayor governor I will not go into

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:16.770
 controversy here is the decision of the supreme so who decides are the governors and

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.029
 the mayors the price of the republic the federal executive coffin I cannot enter

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:25.849
 in this area but it's ok let's continue a little bit here

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:31.279
 and there are more measures there I would like it to be other measures right but already

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:37.580
 exceeded is 600 billion reais the federal government's spending on not only on

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:44.539
 prevention of the disease as well as fight for the maintenance of the job what considers it

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:47.389
 that the government is doing now have here let me know that you understand more

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:51.889
 economy than me is a bridge, right?

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:57.020
 bridge we are an alternative source is a virtual bridge the

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:03.589
 Assyrians it and we have this 600 billion reais is maintaining the

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:09.469
 communication between the two banks is from the river only we have a limit I believe

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:14.059
 that three months or four months gets complicated we hope that what people

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:20.240
 activities come back before that even for me for me who's afraid of 40 is already

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.189
 working without any problem but I don't want to dispute us because we

00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:28.740
 we should in the middle and there is to go for vertical isolation

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:33.090
 but they don’t want to be launched here so at the moment we have two diseases in you know

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.479
 do not know that there the issue of the virus and the unemployment equation which is an evil

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:41.370
 This story of staying at home is terrible too, because people are moni community

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:45.750
 very poor, you know, you live in poor neighborhoods, you can't stay at home either

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:51.810
 there is no way out to bring the bread inside the house so ok

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:56.159
 quite complicated i'm sure the president this is all

00:07:56.159 --> 00:08:00.110
 resolved I have news that some governors some mayors also

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:05.250
 it seems that minas gerais has already started in this line of needs that i

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:10.500
 I do not have any symptoms nor do I care about the one detected by a virus.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.879
 released by the respective governor but let's go ahead here more

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:19.139
 such a thing was also invented provisional measure that sometimes we end up

00:08:19.139 --> 00:08:23.520
 to also sign the payment of the condyles electricity bill for 9

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:29.260
 million families are known ok and up to 150 already they have a difference

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:36.849
 social fare and spends up to $ 150 will go for three months without paying the

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:43.200
 electricity bill and

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.029
 and another 11 thousand Brazilians were repatriated and recalls that operation that

00:08:48.029 --> 00:08:53.850
 we did in china right with february starts in march it was quite clear for us is

00:08:53.850 --> 00:09:00.000
 for foreign affairs defense health station was quite expensive now the

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.230
 leaving action is being done differently bringing the Brazilian from outside

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:08.910
 logically makes due attendance with disembarks and they are to release soon after

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:15.060
 11 thousand Brazilians already repatriated defense and defense relations so well

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:21.779
 embratur in for all gilson in the very connected gilson our pernambucano thats

00:09:21.779 --> 00:09:26.870
 for you here 60 million what is financed for civil construction

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:29.980
 for small and medium-sized businesses with 50 inches

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:37.180
 it is but it doesn't show my boss can speak clearly today we announce in the box

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:46.090
 morning 43 billion reais in a new credit line where the construction companies

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:54.970
 commit to keeping 1.2 million people working and at the same time with

00:09:54.970 --> 00:10:02.260
 the total conditions of safety at work for the issue is health so

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:08.230
 is very important president because it allows for the maintenance of employment and

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:14.020
 more than the line of credit this bad news practically first hand we

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:20.920
 we are giving and six months grace period ie if you buy is a one

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:27.460
 apartment now you just need to start paying in 7 months and the

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:33.110
 same thing for the company because it wanted and gives the working capital slack to

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.500
 company and also for the person at that time the overdraft in the box

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:44.420
 how much is 2 percent already seeing is 2.9 but you can dine there

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:50.990
 torrent while 2.3 percent recently it 14 by 14 percent there and then the

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:56.370
 cash was missing right but not and the total profit record we had

00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:03.420
 last year was a double record last year I never heard anything and left only one

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:08.820
 important point if I think it strengthens your government's organization is the

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:13.670
 minister paulo guedes three weeks ago talked to you and then to me

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:22.800
 about it is for the informal ones and then we in three weeks got it

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:28.950
 get up and we will pay the three presidential installments in 50 days which

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:34.560
 what's happening the first installment will be paid in mid-April the second in

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:43.560
 end of April and the third at the end of May so we will pay by the end of more

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:47.190
 one hundred and ninety-eight billion reais

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:57.600
 help is welcome almost 90 and 98 98 million 4 million Brazilians

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:02.279
 it's more of a subject here it was quiet little pisep ice ice to the bottom of

00:12:02.279 --> 00:12:08.720
 guarantee and we intend to pay 1045 already have money is yours in our will was yours

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:15.170
 and circulate them starting in June now 60 million Brazilians will be

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:21.230
 benefited the estimate of the ministry of economy are 36

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:27.660
 and then and we have over 20 million Brazilians

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:35.540
 that has no account we have to see the relationship between r $ 600 there are more than

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:41.180
 over 10 million Brazilians so in three months 40 million Brazilians who

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:45.860
 until today they had no bank account they started to have free also taking

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:52.610
 taking into account the financial health of brazil because jobs are also harmful right 80

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:57.050
 eighty pine trees ideal for helping states and municipalities with suspensions of

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:04.009
 debts and new credits exactly saying something has even again to

00:13:04.009 --> 00:13:10.279
 the government's great mathematical social policy instrument and we

00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:15.199
 we do this all over brazil there are several presidential loans we

00:13:15.199 --> 00:13:23.139
 we made in 3 days 3 billion reais for 200 cities today we are analyzing

00:13:23.139 --> 00:13:29.209
 50 300 municipalities in five and a half billion reais so as soon as this

00:13:29.209 --> 00:13:31.860
 money was released in two or three weeks

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:37.740
 and more than 5 billion reais will be released to 300 municipalities and normally

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:43.089
 president that the smallest municipalities and we will go over there going to

00:13:43.089 --> 00:13:50.800
 closure right the question of the famous hydroxychloroquine right some medicine from

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.569
 bolsonaro is not my non-personal medicine ok ok get some information today that

00:13:55.569 --> 00:14:01.720
 price of france macron and met with researchers from

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:07.940
 dailson hydroxychloroquine in addition to other authorities right in this room

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:12.790
 infectology there in total france all over the world thank you i believe that soon

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:22.580
 I am not saying a complete study, right?

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:30.680
 emergency is giving a lot of strength to the use of the hill in combating the personnel

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:38.240
 committed of color invitation 19 invite 19 it's going so that's it the whole world is

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:44.470
 concerned about it china has stopped exporting the input for you

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:49.060
 and is to produce hydroxychloroquine is we have a good relationship with the

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:54.790
 indian government in apology here india ok she has a good launch with the

00:14:54.790 --> 00:15:00.130
 first cut with india as we all were in january at his maximum date

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:04.330
 the date of the republic can only a head of state is invited we had the

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:09.190
 honor to be invited so we need emergency now from india is

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:14.110
 this for that and a quantity was released that is forecasted on Saturday

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:19.760
 passed for tomorrow so we have a survival to manufacture here look

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:27.950
 and this train here you can see one that is not but hydroxychloroquine here so the

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:37.730
 everything that seems to indicate has saved lives just yesterday pronouncement

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:43.960
 to the nation I had talked to dr kalil and he had a critical role

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:48.290
 confessor that I said he used I put it in differently from that other

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:52.310
 guy that another colleague there who is connected to the governor right that other

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:58.550
 colleague there and again gave strength to that there and the doctor fell into one of the

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:02.810
 interviews I thought it was really cool, right, why did he say he used it and why

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:07.490
 said that he also taught patience he spoke so that there was no way to

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:12.170
 waiting for you to wait for the scientific study to be proven is going to take a

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:18.260
 two years are not me for those who are here, affected by the disease, can't wait

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:22.440
 the vast majority will die well so congratulations I remember the episode

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:29.250
 of the war of the pacific where the soldier arrives in the wounded right without blood and private

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:34.410
 transfusion and the day without then personal cake not the business there in the water part

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:39.840
 coconut and played there watching the soldier over there and it worked out imagine if it had to

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:45.330
 waiting for scientific proof of that would have died everyone is for

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:52.110
 blood loss so our our laboratory has four laboratories here

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:58.860
 in Brazil between them here this one of that miracles after there is another one here

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:03.930
 there are several laboratories in brazil that are able to produce millions of

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:09.770
 access pills a day and I don't know how the world is

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:14.689
 prepared the country but has countries in India for example if you need

00:17:14.689 --> 00:17:18.919
 tablets in large quantities I don't know what it is like we are a lot of has

00:17:18.919 --> 00:17:23.529
 a juice for the medicine that used the whole world

00:17:23.529 --> 00:17:27.909
 there is still a young man with medicine supplies and Brazil has a

00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:33.940
 dozen quite strong pharmacist here so if india for example needs

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:39.880
 let's suppose to make pills in large quantities I don't know if they have this

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:44.470
 capacity also more until separately hot it advances that already I talked with the

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:53.590
 patient but the patient touches the doctor you go comedy you said he

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:56.980
 recipe one thing you know will not work because it can happen

00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:01.780
 you have the right to a whole pocket knife you have every right to change doctors all

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:06.640
 respect and to all professionals so I repeat the doctor did not leak not patient

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:13.180
