00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:31.270
 within the national senate, when I arrived from a trip, I went to the port

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:38.920
 cheerful there in the southern military command by event of the command shift of the do

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.710
 general miotto for joão stuff and obviously also another meeting

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.140
 and already scheduled to address issues of varying interests in our Brazil

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.720
 so good luck to the new commander congratulations almir another the man who

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.120
 met in 1973 at the army cadet preparatory school and the first year

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.360
 he second we go there so my admiration for his professionalism was born

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.800
 went to the reserve now and it looks like it will stay in rio grande do sul

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:19.330
 poetry his command passing speech right he promised his children the

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.979
 couple of children and grandchildren who are making up for the time they spent away from them

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.490
 while not only at the head of the southern military command but also

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.710
 other missions well the family deserves it deserves and after 40 36 years services

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.120
 lighting 48 in service the same hello

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:45.100
 and the cd that is the organization for cooperation and economic development

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:52.420
 invited Brazil for economic recovery after the issue is coronavirus

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.360
 so logically and it is good to be part of this group it is good to be

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.909
 remembered for giving in is but we will have a serious problem ahead

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:10.549
 and it has a note it also hurts telling you that the informal economy is with those people

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:15.200
 what he calls invisible these people great for us we serve with

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.140
 this emergency aid of 600 reais and informality is very large in america

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.980
 from the south and in africa they think that the average loss will reach the world, right

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.660
 cutting other countries and sixty percent and here in africa and latin america

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.549
 the loss of this is around eighty percent so it is more or less following the

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.570
 guy and the guy earned informally R $ 1000

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.840
 he will spend earning $ 200 and look at a [ __ ] that also corroborates unfortunately

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.830
 in that sense, I had training now that the globe biscuits phase there in the river

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:05.840
 of January from here that it exists 2253 temporarily or rather it is closed

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.860
 indefinitely closed then because the informal ones lived off selling the

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:21.140
 biscuit globe on the beach and here soccer stadium benches corners many

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:28.240
 on the streets and there is no one to sell to, so these people not only closed

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.870
 indefinitely the globe biscuit phase has to see me is not

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.940
 formality, you will have to look for another cookie

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.450
 I am myself

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:48.200
 and the problems, you know, the second wave I was talking about from the beginning I was hard

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.020
 criticized by the media are coming right in part not seen with great gravity

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.360
 also the consequences of special unemployment among informal workers who are

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:06.550
 calculates in Brazil at home and 38 million people are just the situation almost

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:12.440
 desperate grace of emergency aid from the federal government and 600 reais for

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.350
 these informal is the second installment has already started to be

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:23.180
 this pays three installments and another installment is not foreseen and the number of

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.970
 among other freelancers we have already paid your mother is 44 million

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.330
 Brazilians 44 million Brazilians received the first installment I have

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.070
 some millions still under analysis because that bernardes some

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.009
 problem happened and practically shape effect is manual each of these a lot

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:48.349
 people are signed up but are not entitled to what does not fit the criteria

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:54.240
 as the amount of resources in the savings chain is the volume of income tax

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.110
 declared in the previous year to put a filter does not have one if you pay for more than

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.250
 100 million people involved are unable to afford this is with

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.660
 this with this expense that belongs to the taxpayer is not mine it is not the

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:12.000
 contributor so the seed I have seen a lot of videos and humble people

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.069
 we thank r $ 600 hi and our government really answered

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:24.610
 those who still need a possible return to normality with all the

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.440
 problem that is the inter raises here we lost in latin america understand

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:36.190
 eighty percent of the income right in the informal as well as the concern of the cd and

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.830
 I recover the economy of the countries in which Brazil was invited after the

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.199
 australia's globe biscuit pandemic has nothing to do with the globe system of

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:51.610
 television is not always on the beach always buy my kids with cookies

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.280
 to see a lot of people will miss it I hope that this closing time

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:04.180
 indeterminate there is put an end point quickly that can go back to doing

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.460
 economics work something else here the collection of delegate ramage of the

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:17.770
 federal police made an outburst this morning doesn’t personally offend anyone from

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.840
 institutions have full conviction of that I just put myself in the place of the delegate

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:30.120
 the police to the branch which is a monocratic injunction of the supreme

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.110
 federal court he was prevented from taking office and that just read here

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:39.630
 quickly the most important parts the delegate's curriculum relaxes that I

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:46.140
 I met after the elections because the federal police decided to change

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.190
 some delegates who were in my security until the second round of

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.510
 elections and exchange in view of the security it gives from that

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:59.640
 moment he would no longer be the candidate for the president-elect and a lot of things, right?

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:07.050
 was treated and passed as wife of the state as if he were president-elect and

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:12.750
 it was the federal police the director general of the time omnes the justice together with the

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:20.640
 president michel fear that they endorsed this exchange so they voted people is

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:25.770
 more experienced let’s say next to me qualified all are from the police

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:31.180
 federal voted people and the delegate hamachi who is the delegate

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:36.400
 branches in his whole life he was part of the coordination of the operation

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:42.669
 car wash in rio de janeiro is a man fond of fighting corruption a man

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:47.620
 really that that has a history has a curriculum this car wash operation that

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:54.509
 so much pride for all of us that it set a new milestone in Brazilian politics

00:07:54.509 --> 00:08:00.699
 arresting and making an operation on those who defrauded the purse he was

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:04.689
 also operational coordinator of the federal police for the world cup and

00:08:04.689 --> 00:08:09.340
 olympics so two events quite important for us world cup and

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:15.279
 olympics he was an operational coordinator for the police

00:08:15.279 --> 00:08:17.930
 do on the occasion of these two events

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:24.350
 and he was also superintendent of the federal police of Ceará, that is, he has

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.320
 has on its curriculum a superintendence of the important state

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:32.270
 that the state of ceara he was director of substitute personnel management

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:36.779
 of the federal police has already been at the summit of the federal police

00:08:36.779 --> 00:08:42.060
 and he was a grassroots coordinator without intelligence against drug trafficking in

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:50.129
 northern region this drug that causes the Brazilian family so badly so its

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:55.350
 delegate tail branch was coordinator of the intelligence bases to seek

00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:01.180
 really you know who was doing the operations to combat trafficking over

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:06.070
 and he inaugurated the federal repression police unit, right?

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:11.200
 to crimes against the person homicides and death squads in another

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:17.980
 experience that he had in another one that the federal police does a lot is

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:24.150
 precision he was regional delegate and acting superintendent in roraima

00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:29.440
 so it was surprising also in roraima the very important state our

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:36.720
 country that has immeasurable wealth mineral wealth a little bit of

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:42.900
 biodiversity also hello huh and her state that suffers nowadays is

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:48.030
 a lot with the lack of electricity there we are fighting so that I am not a

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:53.519
 tucuruí lion and it is a reality one day but having in

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:57.509
 In view of the indigenous reserves, we still have trouble getting through

00:09:57.509 --> 00:10:01.559
 transmission over reserve as a consequence when we can do that and

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:05.879
 no more energy came from venezuela here we spend for brazil spent for

00:10:05.879 --> 00:10:12.119
 day, right, 1 million liters of diesel oil to make even the snot work and handle it

00:10:12.119 --> 00:10:19.019
 is subsidized if it were pro at the end of the line the consumer would pay would be the two

00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:25.709
 three times more expensive than what you pay for electricity in the rest is from

00:10:25.709 --> 00:10:28.800
 brazil then the branch went through the superintendence of roraima and your

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:34.139
 taking the opportunity to talk about our difficulty in bringing the union, right from manaus to

00:10:34.139 --> 00:10:39.089
 until good view to have electricity on the street now the other

00:10:39.089 --> 00:10:45.899
 factor approximate numbers we have there in roraima the valley of the cotingo river more or

00:10:45.899 --> 00:10:55.710
 minus 12 km with a level difference he hello you could install there

00:10:55.710 --> 00:11:02.320
 turbines it’s okay to make a dam shape so that you could generate

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.770
 electric energy not only to provide volume but also to be exported by the state of Goiás

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:12.790
 chipping if necessary and for a very large area from the

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:16.680
 valley of the cotingo river how hard are you doing this indigenous reservation

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:23.260
 talita in we have two huge yanomami indigenous reserve at peace and don't take the

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:27.370
 Serra do Sol fox in this state he also from the state of amazonas and his

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:32.770
 reservations saying men is checked in the past that its denying an article 174

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:39.690
 I am not mistaken 74 of the constitution is about this and says that it can be explored

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:45.220
 it is missing and regulations are being taken by parliament, admiral benedict

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:49.640
 that the minister of mines and energy a few months send a project to

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:55.810
 and there and to regulate that article of

00:11:55.810 --> 00:12:02.050
 constitution the bus could then if the congress approves concorde I click

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:08.500
 pineapple from roraima would be the 11 parliamentarians right would be in favor of

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:17.440
 that and we have to regulate the indian devices would benefit from the

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.160
 the project is written that you have to have here is the essence of the Indian for the indigenous people

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:27.100
 to do that there and they would benefit a lot from the steering wheel if this type

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:34.420
 economic activity could be installed in the region of the river valley

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:40.750
 cotingo also his branch to professor at the national police academy then

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:46.510

 and ramalho was also the security coordinator of the president of the republic

00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:31.860
 elected okay resumes happened there obviously anything is happening

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:38.399
 against my physical integrity against my life okay is the mission of the

00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:43.110
 ramalho and his team that nobody does anything alone is to avoid it there and

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:48.019
 obviously he came to work with me after the knife attack

00:13:48.019 --> 00:13:55.800
 of the adélio that was of the sixth of september 2018 then hamad exercised with

00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:02.519
 this mission was very, very prompt and there was a friendship there, because as well as

00:14:02.519 --> 00:14:06.629
 you have with that person who works at your house at your company in your

00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:11.160
 ok he became a person who used to have breakfast in the morning with me

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:17.730
 I used to eat bread with condensed milk, the coffee I made was okay and then

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:25.089
 he he if I am not mistaken it is and he was in finding marriage of

00:14:25.089 --> 00:14:30.010
 my right son is right and the branch is also the person very dear to

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:34.329
 police officers and delegates give it to you and I’m sure the officers

00:14:34.329 --> 00:14:40.460
 and delegates put themselves in the place of the branch that had the mural there

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:45.740
 the last moment by a monocratic injunction denied his possession and the

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:50.780
 ramalho is currently the director of the agency the president intelligence are

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:57.410
 my mother's outburst was in that sense it's yours to put next to a person

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:04.730
 sure we didn’t have a chance to see his dream come true we can’t I

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:08.540
 I will pass one on to the Minister of the Supreme Federal Court is more vinícius

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:13.610
 he is not for me that screen life fragrance of this man is for his

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:18.080
 gone through all that has already done for the paw in the fight against corruption in the fight against

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:25.840
 crime and to review the situation so that he can assume and the

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.960
 friendship that I have food because he was assigned to a person

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:35.210
 better prepared at that most experienced moment at that moment to

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:39.620
 participate in the security of parana republic as well as i have four

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:44.310
 order helpers a friend here i'm sure it's a

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:49.140
 unique opportunity that they have when working with me we are center of power

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:53.320
 and I say more right the four helping where my sound comes from

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:58.840
 the two biggest ones now the biggest 3 only know that in maria it is not bigger it is the corvette

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:04.810
 right and also now the lieutenant colonel cidinei them they are is an experience

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:11.860
 Here, I believe that most of the largest armed forces would like to

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:15.460
 integrating because you know the power inside is an experience that will take

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:21.160
 for life afloat is all life ok and this hope that is being that does not serve

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:26.110
 ahead in the future for perhaps not taking on another role with a view to

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:31.990
 have participated in a government as a helper or even as a bunch the

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:36.040
 his crime at the time the wrong would be wrong between to do at the time is by

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:41.290
 having participated in my security is the is the proximity to me and I have

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:46.640
 sure with that curriculum with that past the delegate the branch

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:54.470
 oh it's making the front of the federal police she has more freedom

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:59.180
 even though she always has freedom, right, so she can

 do his job better and he as he has been talking to me right and at that

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:09.079
 nobody from this november and december event in rio de janeiro ate

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:15.700
 security also had the agency platoon which are the papiloscopists

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:22.750
 he misses the police a lot in the federal police okay he said he comes right he

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:26.950
 he has a very special affection for these people and I'm sure he

 being ahead now and will have a very special look for everyone in the

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:37.470
 federal police to seek solved the anxieties their problems that perhaps

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:44.500
 exist exists may exist in the future so this is this this relationship that he made

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:51.100
 with me in rio de janeiro this friendship and respect for him is right

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:55.720
 through him get to know the federal police better dive deeper into the police

00:17:55.720 --> 00:18:00.640
 federal government can do what once for the superintendent he can be a

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:06.670
 fullness your work everybody wins the win-win republic award

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:10.990
 federal police win-win population as a whole because fighting crime

00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:15.890
 to trafficking to other Elysiums up to the transactional and

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:21.980
 and it’s with his experience that we can do much much better accuracy and

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:28.400
 really help brazil is in this area so hope that after my outburst it gave

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:34.010
 from the heart we are all human beings that not only your alexandre alexandre

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:39.380
 supreme federal court as well as the others delivering the supreme right within the

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:45.200
 speed and thinking about the branch in life despite this person that this decision

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:51.080
 be reviewed as soon as possible so that we can really name it

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:56.230
 justice that now has the new captain there andré mendonça who was at aggeo

00:18:56.230 --> 00:19:03.040
 can really satisfy all of us how much it can produce.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:08.500
 this ministry is and quickly says something because the

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:14.650
 Brazilian government, since before Carnival, had already warned about the issue of

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:19.750
 coronavirus in Brazil and was already taking some steps in this direction and

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:27.309
 this problem is of interest to all of us in our we know what can happen

00:19:27.309 --> 00:19:32.559
 still in Brazil the fruit of the virus issue and we know that unfortunately a lot

00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:37.030
 person will die if he regrets and unfortunately it is a reality ok

00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:44.200
 now we must face it there and look for the best possible way of looking together

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:48.760
 alternatives what is up to the federal government at the end of the line is up to the

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:53.590
 governor and mayor take the steps that have been taken ok i will not enter the

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:58.990
 I'm not even going to discuss it with the federal government, practically nothing fits

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:07.870
 in this area we are here like him the action of the Ministry of Health and the

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:13.990
 resource is we here we are already in the house of waiting for the right house 700 billion

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:19.090
 of reais the federal government after the decree of the state of calamity that

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:23.590
 was welcomed by the chamber and the senate is national you can can came to be able

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:28.960
 spend then not worrying about the ceiling right a conditional amendment approved

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:35.770
 of this three years ago approximately so we serve you right is first

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:40.990
 place as I said just now 44 million people have already received the first

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:45.760
 portion of that 600 emergency aid and there are three installments so only

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:53.350
 do the accounts of the order of 25 billion reais each installment we

00:20:53.350 --> 00:21:00.070
 we know that it will be close to 80 billion reais in the next 80, far away

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:04.770
 there is expense thing there i was here two weeks ago at

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:08.580
 beautiful waters campaign hospital has just been completed I had there with the

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:13.590
 governor ronaldo whitewashed is with the local mayor was also inaugurated

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:18.600
 then it is in a position to care for possible infected people who have

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.860
 symptoms that the vast majority of the population that says that 80 did in the

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:28.040
 the population goes against it and it will be asymptomatic nor does it even know that it contracted

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:33.809
 now the fifteen twenty percent remaining a small part of those right taking into account

00:21:33.809 --> 00:21:39.330
 seen as units you already illnesses and in view of age may have

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:45.419
 problems that even emerge there in the death of the hospital of

00:21:45.419 --> 00:21:48.900
 campaign is already in beautiful water conditions here in goiás and the tv here the

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:55.919
 possible infected our actions are also helping micro and small

00:21:55.919 --> 00:22:01.990
 companies we have preserved we 4 million jobs have been preserved

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:07.030
 and here I saw a story in the newspaper o Globo de today's us who would say hospital

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:11.800
 globe here, right, miriam piglet mine is so concerned with unemployment until

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:18.700
 finally, finally, miriam leitão is concerned with his job, right?

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:23.260
 this is to pass my flagstone back but I only had opposition and criticism for

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:28.330
 part of it here is in the northeast case in the first meeting with councilors who

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:33.910
 we had for a specific wrinkle deal with health and others asked for 4 billion the

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:40.570
 paulo guedes the bank eight billion to the northeast are northeast yes it's more than

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:47.140
 that shows concern we know that the poorest region of brazil is one of the

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:52.150
 poorest in Brazil and need this support from the federal government then

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:58.960
 instead of four with a request from the governor, I’ve already talked about a favor

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:02.000
 here your state and municipality that decides the collection of insulation

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.140
 the hyacinth we are coming home this is always fine today so actions for

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:11.900
 face the invitation of 19 700 billion and may reach new measures the

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:17.540
 parliament we can still get a trillion reais in the house or a share

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:23.390
 huge fantastic but with a life comes first the federal government for

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:29.540
 through its economic team released and has been releasing this resource but

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:34.790
 I also repeat busy the economic team and my special that I have to have

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:39.040
 a vision encompassing all ministries from the first moment

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:46.280
 ours we worry about unemployment well and jobs are coming strong

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:53.480
 slamming the door there of the Brazilian worker and the emergency measures in the

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:59.090
 measures taken by many governors and mayors of total isolation ok

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:07.220
 what has been taken has consequences today from the airport in porto alegre to the

00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:11.210
 southern military command I saw ninety percent of the closed trade was open

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:17.660
 there the bakery butcher some things there more than essential the rest everything

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:23.450
 closed on a cold on Thursday a normal day the governor said it's ok

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:28.340
 buying eduardo now eduardo leite buying we start to open the

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:33.110
 people Monday a very well studied plan I hope it works out

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:36.470
 I hope that the great south will return to normal as soon as possible until

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:42.610
 because repeating seventy percent of the population is going to be infected

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:48.490
 oh yeah and from what it looks like from what we are seeing now all the effort to find ok

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:55.400
 curve was practically useless and now a consequence of that effect

00:24:55.400 --> 00:25:02.740
 collateral of unemployment the people want to go back to work everybody knows that

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:08.539
 that the younger the less problem one has to have a consequence of

00:25:08.539 --> 00:25:14.559
 our teaching virus-infected is that I'm under 40 years old

00:25:14.559 --> 00:25:19.630
 of those infected with problems with problems not with some other common

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:23.700
 community then from 0 to councilor by saint just that

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:28.559
 the uncle that the end is tragic we will continue to

00:25:28.559 --> 00:25:32.090
 and I think the money's gone

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:37.899
