00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:08.690
in buenos aires argentina 19 hours and a half dozen is June

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:16.010
 we came here the meeting offers your economic team macri as entrepreneurs and

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:23.269
 a lot will deal with something we will talk about now in this quick live here

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:29.840
 our diet we have here the sergio is philippines to the

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.200
 right very well finished messing with the farmer's table campo grande mato grosso

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.790
 from the south with the most important city in chile there that I think learning in

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:29.830
 left the champion of the project in some points with the support of the camera

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.310
 only logically do we expect to believe in the bed that rodrigo himself

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.869
 Maya said that she will create a special commission that will analyze and

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.479
 analysis is may find that they exaggerate the other as well as the planets with all

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.250
 are sure to face this project in a good way

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.200
 what I feel back to Brazil likes the state to be in charge of it

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.030
 state, you know, I say more and more that he has to do it

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.239
 who fights and looks who is giving what to say look just how things are not well

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.290
 so you appear at the moment the baby seat thing

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:21.540
 whoever decided to attack whoever decided never in his career was found any

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.780
 assembled person is a song for $ 3 plus seven points in the initial appealed portfolio

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.220
 and it records, that is, there was no editing, there was also

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:42.090
 it's actually a tax that we did we created the figure of the warning and

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:51.269
 there is never obviously because I think he loves a warrant officer or treats the law something

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:57.600
 for the son is your protégé the guardian knows this

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.859
 go there and put on the gym bring and take and bring

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:08.609
 just accusing me there i am tempted against life

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:14.609
 agatha is exactly the opposite there was no punishment and on the day a financial penalty

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:21.239
 also now our bill phorm bill project is going to have the warning is

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:30.900
 explained the higher the touch the smaller or even the one that there are movements of the

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.160
 arguments of the government's spending process of successful interference and the

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:48.840
 intervention I always trust my boys

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.230
 we have to trust with others to make Brazil better for everyone

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:08.879
 here is my training leaving the one that you have a voice about cachaça in the gums

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:17.640
 of Argentina recognizes the unique Brazilian cachaça the plate will be is

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.289
 recognized the geographical identity of Brazilian cachaça here in argentina is

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:28.380
 an old election the small symbolic a sample president the goodwill and the

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.969
 partnership that the Brazilian people do not have for the various topics of

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:39.060
 common interest as the integrated band that goes from a state resource both

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.039
 artificial when integrating the health certificate to facilitate the

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:49.770
 the lives of entrepreneurs in brazil and argentina, finally, several issues that

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.860
 19 were around us, Brazil has already received nine and us at 4 they have

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.830
 promised that in 34 and they solve other problems like

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.250
 but the export of wheat flour water

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.620
 the pet unit is a product for shipping which is very important

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.380
 there the pets who Brazil starts now a new era of integration

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.840
 and the friendship really with the argentina in a little while she comes back to talk about the

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.840
 his passage through asia in particular china on the left end here inside the

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:32.810
 state of lower voter density calls if it is I have been there twice

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.060
 during the pre-campaign and seeing the agony of that people regarding energy is

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.530
 important for anything state that depends largely on the energy of the

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.760
 venezuela there at the goiânia plant that had paid

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.930
 but almost daily and then collapsed due to lack of maintenance and passed

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:56.480
 to depend on 100% of the athlete consuming approximately 1 million liters of

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.100
 diesel oil a day detail a large part subsidize the whole

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.860
 the world in brazil paid for the good news morana good news president here of

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.240
 according to your guidance and determination so five months

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.930
 we managed to hold an auction of energy from renewable energy sources

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:23.720
 clean that will double the energy availability of the state of roraima and better

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:29.830
 than that will reduce the cost of that energy as you know says a million

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:37.580
 of liters of diesel, which corresponds to almost one million nine hundred million

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.200
 per year that all consumers for this energy that we're going to

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:48.500
 provide a panorama from 2021 onwards will have a cost reduction in terms of

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:54.440
 approximately 35% that so this is president public policy and this is what

00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:03.560
 the state has to do in a little while will talk about the union in terms of the portfolio of

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.780
 driver look now see Paulo

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:15.890
 see i'm older i'm 64 years old 60 and 69 going out in the cool

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:24.980
 the rate applied look what is good can happen we started to say that

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:32.570
 has a driver from five to ten years after the age of 65 it became five years to

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:36.620
 validity of it so nowadays it is five years is the

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:46.100
 From the 33th year onwards, it is best for you that the day to renew the portfolio of

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:51.820
 driver doesn’t lose right man ten years a day and from sixty-five

00:07:51.820 --> 00:08:03.740
 cents the pension plan is you are just that you will look for the DMV and make

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:09.470
 a battery of exams that some will uncomplicate total five to ten years but

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:14.360
 the size nobody will have to claim a whole letter to the baby's car seat

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:20.240
 problem the sky of fine or penalty in the

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:25.520
 score now with certainty ie we then created something to stimulate the

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.630
 element against catania if one can speak of going out

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:33.919
 Paulo in order to pass here to remove what represents that in America

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.560
 from the south the potential with the name of brazil and

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.630
 Argentine together that can represent a way that we are not one of the biggest

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:46.310
 agricultural powers their level and one of the greatest powers

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:51.320
 energetic also that we laugh a lot in cases of oil we have a return and

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.360
 compression of the year was precisely combining them energy integration

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.930
 communism pac a great loot this interaction of the agribusiness scripts

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:05.750
 teresa was agreed here she mainly her message is her

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:13.370
 transformation with the brand president which is to make a mercosur that attracts angus

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:18.829
 in this Argentine region it was already the sixth richest country in the world and Brazil is the

00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:26.480
 name that most grew in mercosul 2011 through knowledge and also threatened

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:32.240
 our democracy as it did with 60 so the watchword here both the

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.589
 president works when president marcos was just the freedom to

00:09:36.589 --> 00:09:42.140
 economic freedom and political freedom market democracy to put

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.820
 one more to grow in the economic space in fact to set up the mercosur will

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:51.980
 run don't catch me the two savings are going to that cheap energy not having food

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:57.410
 cheap and let's start with the reaction of the local economy that sees that a citizen

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:06.380
 Jardim eldorado paulista right city where i was raised like this in the transition they talk

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:13.279
 ask the lady here to talk about the bananas issue that tim burton activates her

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:17.240
 revoked and know it despite the vacancy to know

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:22.730
 congratulations to you I work for sale and china that ended this ghost of

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:28.940
 banana collection is from ribeira valley is protected is saving money

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:35.089
 she smells me you get better doctor quickly what you extract from your

00:10:35.089 --> 00:10:41.240
 passage through asia special to him the china that you stayed there when more than

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:46.190
 a week doesn’t even think it’s a passage through art she was fantastic

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:52.730
 first we see a potential that we still have to be able to expand

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:58.459
 our exports of meat grains and mainly value added in china

00:10:58.459 --> 00:11:02.330
 today with the problem they have of African swine fever everything that we

00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:06.080
 we produce staying in brazil in argentina in paraguay and uruguay is not

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.610
 enough to fulfill that market so we have a window of

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:17.450
 opportunity that south america can help you with on anything but not on

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:21.080
 special in brazil in japan we talked about opening the market

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:25.760
 meats and also fruits and they really need Brazilian fruits

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:32.660
 that with our friends our producers and we only export 3% of our fruits in the

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:37.610
 laos now i just received today the news that it is a small country but that already

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:43.610
 a week ago gave us the answer of chicken exports and export of

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:49.130
 standing ox and export of cattle for breeding which was in cooperation with the

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:56.300
 embrapa of ours is of all our potential is tropical of our production is

00:11:56.300 --> 00:12:00.130
 a president is a fantastic thing we are going to leave

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:06.460
 there and for lack of potential pleasure Vietnam and indonesia laos

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:12.460
 malaysia and china china doesn’t even speak 1 billion 400 thousand people

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:16.390
 Brazil has to work hard to be able to send more and more all

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:19.090
 facts when I say that each minister my

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:32.620
 is equivalent for 10 minutes instead of following the fight, which is a sack in petroleum

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:38.440
 knowing the tourist potential surrounding the region and what is possible the government

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:42.640
 help you primary fruit export

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:47.920
 we are already there within the disposition quickly linhão do tucuruí

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:53.710
 very line would include going from manaus to good view here for over six

00:12:53.710 --> 00:13:00.730
 years is about to be consumed and that we will lose approximately a year a

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:06.430
 subsidy of around 1 billion one hundred million reais almost 100 million per

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:10.990
 month we ask that it is not built

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:18.160
 lion union that goes from manaus to good view something - union president is good

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:24.060
 say with you mentioned roraima is the state with the lowest demographic density

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:30.370
 but it is one of the richest states in brazil and because of this lack of

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:36.730
 energy and has no way to develop as it could and it helps not only me

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:41.410
 but all over brazil the schedule that the government established

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:49.090
 to is the beginning of the works of the linhão de tucuruí from manaus to boa vista is

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:54.060
 faithfully fulfilling establishing we hope to have the installation license

00:13:54.060 --> 00:14:00.480
 by the end of July and the beginning of August the end of August we will be in this

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:07.440
 starting the works of the lion and 2021 will be a year that we will not only have new

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:14.699
 source of energy in roraima but also finally the lion providing energy for

00:14:14.699 --> 00:14:21.480
 the question is even knowing the mines and energy is also the area below the

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.050
 land in one of the passages via jumping said

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:30.779
 a truth the figure of speech if i were re-elected from roraima with the

00:14:30.779 --> 00:14:36.870
 technology and 20 years we will have an economy close to japan with four grand corp

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:41.970
 there is a lot of president I think that all these public policy actions

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:47.279
 focused on the state of roraima will allow that state to be exactly

00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:52.920
 what you have said several times is a very rich state and will

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.370
 contribute a lot to the country's development

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:01.829
 iii person when we have to do the environmentally friendly wedding

00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:08.100
 progress roraima has been almost unviable with the other in brazil

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:12.660
 rondonia of this problem until and quickly this problem there is a plate

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:16.860
 the people sought a lot of forest in southern Brazil all over

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:22.680
 with these reserves is noble indigenous quilombolas and environmental protection parks

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:27.380
 national state parks is absurd to leave the mistake my dog ​​is

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:32.910
 recognize the decree that demarcated the ecological station was on condition that

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:37.829
 kicking wrong but look at me is absurd you have a mark for example it was

00:15:37.829 --> 00:15:46.519
 verified by decree in recent years the wave of this trip

00:15:54.230 --> 00:16:02.000
 what changes the opposition article in another function

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:08.980
 the company was the only one that I spoke with and there was still no law in the front that digs

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:12.820
 decree is repealed in December a specific law

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:20.080
 if you have two decrees that move two continuous hours of 22 projects not even for

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:25.180
 that is done to make Brazil unviable let's suppose that today I solve

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:35.200
 here is wavering 5,000 decree is that when only a crazy person is interested, not to have been

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:54.630
 the bill in parliament that takes too long

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:21.570
 I would like to do in the bay of angra the moto garbage from Brazil and the world are

00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:33.700
 stolen playing the league can not in front of the island

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:40.150
 big but almost a hundred is still water hot water is pound

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:45.040
 ltda you can't do anything the field of

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:52.200
 invoice per year 12 billion one billion

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:09.020
 all right he went there then go to the bay of

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:14.900
 creek like la foto gigante 4 i talked a lot of gay the station

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:20.360
 ecological of the juréia any country in the world the yashi rooting in a rational way

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:26.480
 these regions for photo in the Portuguese billions speak for the champion the economy is

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:31.490
 important you can bring our way of seeing the laws in Brazil sometimes

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:37.250
 they destroy resources because they talked about it here in argentina that a country so rich

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:42.920
 in natural resources was the sixth largest economy in the world today in paris brazil

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:48.080
 because brazil was also the name that grew the most for decades a brand

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:53.750
 japan mexico and china more than which is what marcio also stopped growing

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:58.880
 for us we will see are inadequate laws right now is to see the

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:04.070
 petrobras may yield a subsidiary mobilizes supreme court was all

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:09.560
 interrupts a sale also means it is not a reference phrase by the

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:15.020
 knowledge that brazil will advance to register its resources if it develops

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:19.870
 and preserving it is also perfectly possible to economically exploit

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:26.360
 preserving natural resources is it is economically possible to do this but

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:31.190
 we who are possibly the world's second largest resource economy

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:37.060
 we ended up in that country because we are the

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:42.890
 130th as a business environment we have a preference for poverty

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:49.680
 we have a hostility to blacks to investments and to improve the quality

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:56.550
 the use is difficult the boss in brazil left until last year a man from

00:19:56.550 --> 00:20:03.330
 I only went to the street with a lot of fans for sure a lot and sometimes a lot of

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:11.370
 times unfairly because the fights they my lessons are made by each one

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:17.910
 each inspector goes there and does it in his own way we need to know now a protocol

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:22.730

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:28.160
 indiscriminately changing mainly in the field I ask you

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:36.120
 who today pollutes more the farmer in the field to the city on the day of

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:41.970
 today is not because there is only this farmer's party in the field the situation I want

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:48.890
 that the person agrees to keep suffocating the countryside to the city and only numbers

 the transmudar project of losing the portfolio of 20 our understanding to 40

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:11.270

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:35.150
 he asks for a facility not that his organization and 40% because second

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:40.560
 your disk inside has no way to process it all is one is a renowned bureaucracy

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:45.060

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:49.770
 driver that he lost his license has to be subjected to a new

00:21:49.770 --> 00:21:53.820
