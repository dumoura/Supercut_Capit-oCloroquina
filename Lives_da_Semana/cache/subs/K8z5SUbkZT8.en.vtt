00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.739
 we received it is not possible to get the pen here cléo to solve there ok there are laws that

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.140
 we have to have you changed an environmental decree it can only be revoked by

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.209
 example by law by law and another thing is just a hundred of those to mental I

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.569
 I don’t think Brazil will take me if you want to sauté some 20 present you have to

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:07.980
 be a bill for each one this delay delays you to start producing

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.830
 something i cost brazil on top of that it really is is difficult right or

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.560
 we had to try knowing the group of one is almost one some 80 entrepreneurs são paulo

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.780
 are the mega entrepreneurs from all over brazil it was there it took us 6 minutes it was there the

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:32.699
 paulo guedes is andré there was braga grandson in the house of the house of the civil house

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:39.000
 ricardo salles environment jorge oliveira a meeting where we go there

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.130
 to listen to the businessmen there I saw a lot that is up to us to solve

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:50.580
 then the presidential decree, right, ministerial decree and also norms of the

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.729
 federal revenue the impressive paulo then the land was kind of scared right

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:00.360
 how revenue gets in the way in some areas involving us in brazil is the thing

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.860
 terrible terrible pornography right well well we rescheduled a new meeting to

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:13.050
 we scheduled for in June and some for the same some of what was presented

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.660
 ours I will take the solution to the business community and what was very

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.190
 ah ok i know entrepreneurs here they are happy what is happening with the

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:28.720
 the economy of brazil is ok so i never felt so confident in the government's work

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:34.510
 as a whole with regard to production the economy to all areas of brazil the

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.160
 people see the press on the other side criticizing, right, talking badly from gib to pedrinho

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.600
 pedrinho don't know what these guy produce press produce if any

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.290
 thing because truth Brazil would be much better with all this but not

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.640
 produces truth I have been for almost two weeks without speaking to the press that

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.980
 happens when you tell them about you, when you don’t talk they make it up

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.689
 starting the same thing for the place explained the question of gib very well there

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:06.879
 if it’s going to take into account the last few years it’s has had ups and downs so the

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:12.849
 government dilma and we created two 22 years that you liked negative 3.5 3.5 gib

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:17.079
 percent there we wish it wasn't negative in the first government to fear already

00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:22.689
 I recovered it went from minus 3.3 ok plus a point three so the

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:27.009
 growth from 4.6 to growth in growth unlike the negative

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:32.139
 positive of 4.6 in the second government fears a point ours gave a point one but the

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:36.669
 detail that is being in a hurry didn’t notice right and I didn’t understand economics

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:41.919
 ipiranga post who understands to see he explained the people there that the great part

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:47.169
 of participation in the gip now in the last quarter was 1.7 percent so if

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:50.979
 it was a right point in each quarter it would be a right point you above a

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:54.999
 point 3 the government feared but said the king much more participation from

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:59.020
 private initiative than the public service

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.180
 and in the collection to make the final number of the clip so it's fine with the

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.560
 family thanks to god according to paulo guedes here has witnessed economic and

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.659
 proven by businessmen in são paulo so the press continues to win

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:18.580
 more and more discredit is unfortunate what happens to the Brazilian press let's

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:25.120
 there continuing here second party yesterday the veto of article 52 was voted there in

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.190
 budget that had that history of 30 billion hit that whoever defines the

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.909
 The destination of this work would be the national congress.

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:41.190
 voted the veto was maintained by 398 a2 in some games up front will have a

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:46.199
 bargain for 15 million mind shamelessly not listening to that kind of

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:49.800
 negotiation the understanding for parliament and whoever executes budget

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:55.800
 form is the executive branch and the end is now the one that had excess of

00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.870
 collection there that may not be due to the regulations that send talking

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:08.680
 discuss with the Brazilian parliament the song is mine to see the ice and announce the

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:14.230
 guarantee of law and order ended we have eight days for the agency for more

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:20.730
 seven right and on the fifth day of the 2nd extension an agreement was made he

 decided the issue of the police strike look what I said strike the press in

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:31.600
 previous governments spoke of a strike when my government arrived I can speak the

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.830
 that the dumb and the difference mother is the name of a strike ready this press

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:40.480
 here it’s no use that I’m not going to change because I’m on the side of

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.200
 It is true that you have to change only, you’re right, but okay, it solved the problem

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.520
 now let it be clear we’re going to hinder jelly look how come I don’t

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.900
 I want we will not make it difficult because my responsibility you send

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:58.480
 young people of 20 21 22 units who are longing to engage the king to engage

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.840
 armed forces to enter a front line a sale

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:09.950
 the idea a happens a problem is not fair you condemn up to 40 a chain

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:16.030
 soldier who can be your son right the bottom up to 40 years in prison we

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:20.710
 we need exclusionary from illegality I got element accidents fulfill their

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:27.370
 logical mission without access and goes home quietly otherwise combat there died three

 four five ten or fifteen thugs I will not answer so this is it will

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:37.120
 after all it is our responsibility to give this straight

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.350
 now military legal could work and when talking about military I’m talking about the

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:46.000
 20 year old young man who has his girlfriend that I liked on the beach goes on

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.780

 I hope to talk about another pot so you don't want to go back without a problem, right, defendant

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:09.670
 I can interfere in the Brazilian parliament, but on our part, you know, I

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:13.699
 I will make it difficult as it has the algerian responsibility

00:10:13.699 --> 00:10:20.779
 I’m not here, look, I’m talking, they will hardly be put into practice

00:10:20.779 --> 00:10:24.109
 on the part of my government and the justification I'm giving exactly this

00:10:24.109 --> 00:10:27.109
 that I don't want you to do mandatory military service for

00:10:27.109 --> 00:10:31.459

 having the urine rear we will put ageli in practice ok but now

00:11:02.449 --> 00:11:06.769
 the lesson is right, it gives people a bellyache, remember theirs, the dough is

00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:13.680
 impressive right it rained strength but it is health crisis armed forces I saw

00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:20.610

00:24:18.759 --> 00:24:22.929
 message to the Brazilian press seriously right, how I would like you to follow

00:24:22.929 --> 00:24:29.080
 John 8:32 to transmit the truth at the end of the line

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:34.779
 newspapers and ferrari's without a problem the bludgeon is open right now it is

00:24:34.779 --> 00:24:41.950
 the truth doesn’t keep looking for numbers there, which is often distorted

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:45.610
 to say that the government is going to have that the government has credibility that the government

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:49.670
 it is not democratic then I spoke to the press a little more in the first

00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:55.430
 what spoke more than squid dilma and fear together and a year I spoke more than

00:24:55.430 --> 00:25:01.760
 them in 16 years right now you can’t keep talking and make it right look

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:05.690
 a weird word there is talking here is thinking right she said that the

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:10.760
 guy weighs eight arrobas, that can't be all the controversy, right, he criticized the woman who

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:16.430
 he was gay he stayed I don’t know who can’t continue like this we’re

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:19.340
 losing that has a person upon creation losing the right to do

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:23.870
 joke in brazil everything is for everything now it has to be politically correct i

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:27.310
 I want to tell a joke to think is that you sell the fat ones not

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:33.560
 gordophobic 'the bald is bald the phobic offend don't know who a bald

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:38.630

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:43.600
 hi hi front thank you so much I hope the press there has a shock of reality

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:47.630
 begins to have a boss real matters to tell where the

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:54.470
 Brazil is going, right now, it's no use here, we won't spend as much as if

00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:59.510
 spent with the press in the past was absurd that happened right and maybe because

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:04.760
 because of that maybe you attack us all the time and set up a power of attorney

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:08.840
 because we won’t lose to the left now it happens in

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:14.630
 anywhere in uruguay because i was treated very well it was the people in the place

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:19.450
 I didn’t upload a video I don’t know which audio I was booed and applauded

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:24.950
 time a person a person and it was in the middle of the people to show up here I had

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:29.990
 been elected president of uruguay and is based anywhere in the world will

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:34.040
 surely the same thing in miami is I don't know which city is going

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:37.730
 wash the american lakes and then

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:44.840
 and who goes to the river is that sure then throat recognized well treated and

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:49.370
 do not weigh it speaks well I risked investing in Brazil and people I believe

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:55.040
 in Brazil and I'm sure that in the future we will deliver Brazil so that

00:26:55.040 --> 00:27:01.160
