00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:34.310
 Globo This is Globo and some other press agencies are also

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:40.550
 it’s a big size on top of a lady who was 80 at the time 86

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:47.720

 not to do with Mrs. Olinda bonturi bolsonaro test arrived not yet not

00:08:09.449 --> 00:08:14.819
 well then come on let's get on with it here until i need to get the

00:08:14.819 --> 00:08:21.719
 Weapons decree were four decrees we are right there No Limit below that

00:08:21.719 --> 00:08:26.879
 the law allows we did nothing more than that has parliamentarians coming in with the

00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:31.919
 project is that attractive in bed in the Senate and has parliamentarians also coming with

00:08:31.919 --> 00:08:37.229
 action with the Supreme Court always that small party is that that

00:08:37.229 --> 00:08:43.019
 help the Supreme Court against government measures to prevent us from being able

00:08:43.019 --> 00:08:49.699
 working well for brazil 'makes it clear that nothing else we did

00:08:49.699 --> 00:08:58.320
 also attend the 2005 plebiscite where the people decided to buy and sell

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:06.600
 weapons in Brazil were 64 percent, which were favorable to the purchase and sale of

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:13.750
 weapon of Brazil So let's try it, but now our PSOL already had access

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:19.960
 these actions have nothing of materiality nothing nothing everything is all

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:24.310
 According to the law, we didn’t give it to anyone. Some complained

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:28.930
 watchmen for example complain about me, you forgot watchmen I say your

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:35.260
 vigilant that the size of you has to be by law has a project even against the

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:39.670
 deputy not on camera and tries very well new bills from other parliamentarians in the

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:44.500
 The Chamber is also proceeding with the objective of extending the door eh You

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:50.410
 buy other categories I can’t do the door you there yes the decree-law that you

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:57.490
 overturned for unconstitutionality because I would be legislating right beyond the

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:02.740
 that the law allows hopes that the vigilant days may carry a firearm

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:08.260
 fire is also life São Francisco do Sul I've been Santa

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:16.120
 Catarina arrived on Saturday just after lunch and returned on Wednesday

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:22.990
 before lunch go there obviously give you a relaxed but most of the time

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:27.400
 Are you working on something? How big is your heavy work in a little while?

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.690
 will enter the field there is the collection of the price of fuel does not have to not

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:36.910
 was upset by the readjustment today of 10 percent in gasoline and fifteen percent

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:45.040
 nudism i fourth adjustment of the month so Petrobras has this

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:50.820
 is this guarantee right this freedom autonomy to readjust fuels

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:56.199
 taking into account the price of a barrel of oil abroad and taking into account the

00:10:56.199 --> 00:11:02.230
 dollar price in here and other factors weighs negatively on the issue of

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:09.750
 refineries fuel price As it says on Live last here Brazil was

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:15.060
 involved in an adventure in the past to build two refineries in the northeast

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:24.699
 one here in the southeast but another purchase of a refinery in peace from Dina and

00:11:24.699 --> 00:11:30.220
 the final loss exceeded 200 billion reais this account is not in the

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:35.470
 lap of Petrobras is there in the account of the Brazilian people so Petrobras will

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:42.269
 paying this debt of over 200 billion reais Sponsoring the PT government

00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:47.990
 nobody deny I even say right the two refineries in the Northeast one of

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:54.440
 southeast that the biggest consumption were southeast that have to be one in the northeast and two in the

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:59.690
 southeast the direction in each location so to make politicalha to be able to attend the

00:11:59.690 --> 00:12:04.570
 companion Chávez at the time, right? He decided to invest in refineries there to

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:11.779
 benefit oil from Venezuela and gave this and this this loss

00:12:11.779 --> 00:12:15.430
 huge for the Brazilian people

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:25.990
 and today The Official Gazette of the Union published a reduction in the rate of

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:33.149
 import taxes on bicycles in Brazil So this net it 35%

00:12:33.149 --> 00:12:39.910
 That is the regulatory tax today the camex may have decreased without seeking to compensate for the

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:44.320
 which is what stopped collecting here to collect elsewhere so you can

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:49.570
 reduce it from there obviously it was a suggestion of mine I always try to reduce the

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:54.970
 tax burden wherever our government is

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:59.829
 nothing Unlike São Paulo which increased and cms almost everything besides us

00:12:59.829 --> 00:13:05.410
 not increasing anything reduced several rates among them the bicycle that she

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:11.560
 is 35%, it still goes from March now to thirty percent in July

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:15.390
 to 25 and from December 20 percent

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:22.050
 and there, there are other products, we are going to seek to reduce that.

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:28.320
 important yes we have more bicycles in Brazil than vehicles so there are millions

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.760
 tens of thousands of people who use bicycles in Brazil we go slowly

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:37.470
 buying example has certain materials that is considered to be a toy but actually

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:45.600
 are used for by olympic athletes we will Car reduce the percentage of

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:52.350
 importing this material and then the fact came out right, it's sad to be upset because

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:58.050
 the ignorance of some goes in the comments I don’t eat a bicycle I

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:03.810
 I want to know the price of Rice Look at the price of Rice largely comes from

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:08.520
 politics does not stay at home the economy has later I answer with these guys

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:14.340
 want to claim is your right is really not rice worth going up

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:18.070
 from price now onwards the quality to believe high is the

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:25.380
 corn grew the accessory also then the infraction in the products of the basic basket

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:30.610
 hit the twenty percent last year number and huge name ok

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:36.279
 taking into account the value of his salon now I want to complain You can complain

00:14:36.279 --> 00:14:42.610
 No problem but no destination brought look over me go first on the page

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:48.070
 your Governor who closed everything that closed the trade that forced you to stay

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:53.500
 at home and destroyed millions of jobs goes first on them and then

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:58.450
 you come at me so you have to share it is not to share responsibility

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:03.410
 who really and took Brazil in the situation and look that

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:07.700
 Brazil taking into account the FM numbers I of the best left the academy

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:12.620
 because we take steps to protect jobs with the pronoun for example that

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.440
 not my government's proposal by the way Senator Jorginho Mello de

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:20.330
 Santa Catarina as it is commits trucker that São Vicente to test there

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:27.830
 at the congress in bed, it also passed in the Senate for us to decrease the number of times

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:32.930
 Tax amount charged is not fertile of the truck driver is the middle truckers

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:36.890
 if God wants me to bed the proof next week or next week too

00:15:36.890 --> 00:15:40.940
 another initiative of senator Jorginho Mello any parliamentarian who has the good

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:46.820
 initiative we are going to look for this project and work on it And give the due

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:52.100
 credit to the deputy or senator and has many deputies is well intentioned

00:15:52.100 --> 00:16:01.760
 inside the chamber and the Brazilian Senate well then the many questions right

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:08.130

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:14.850
 size as we reduced from 16 to zero percent also the tax

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:20.450
 importing truck tires as we reduced 16 for pain per center

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:26.269
 parts for agricultural machinery we go and help who can help

00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:32.070

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.020
 internet was international that stopped in Argentina this is it Come here

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:33.010
 Ready now in April and more Second International Bridge According to the police

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:36.430
 national of Paraguay a hug is the husband of some Paraguayans watching

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:41.650
 a hug or to the present husband from Paraguay for 2 billion investment does

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:45.310
 he told me it's time to close the numbers now I

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:50.770
 had with him in Cascavel now will hit Two Billion and a half investment is

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:55.940
 thing in the past binational Itaipu is one I had no idea percent of it

00:17:55.940 --> 00:18:02.120
 and what happened there I don’t know anyone can think someone wants to kill the

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:06.830
 work I talked about the tax tariff tariff reduction just now

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:13.820
 import of tire parts for tractors and agricultural machinery without

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:19.450
 similar in Brazil we are already going we will now enter the

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:23.440
 interesting that we entered last week in the complementary bill

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:28.390
 on fuel ICMS and fuel cms

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:33.340
 well then it's an email from the account at the time of 2001 i was already a deputy when this

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:39.340
 this amendment was approved there and the same thing only applies to the

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:49.420
 product and the proposal Our here is for you to decide what the value of the ICMS is

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:58.320
 in each type of fuel and you will not have this one of ours So

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:05.190
 how do I decide I think I even do Asus instead of saying here for

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:10.289
 example the tax on gasoline ICMS already X It can give a maximum value and each

00:19:10.289 --> 00:19:15.000
 state goes up to that maximum there that has been here It seems the more it

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.510
 believe when it seems that the poorer the state I live though SMS

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:24.470
 and then I can make the table here next week now that matters here

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:29.090
 entering you in the cradle line will also say something to us back here look

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:32.300
 it’s very well following the room’s officers, the military of the room is crazy

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:39.410
 army two mistakes here more modern and you're three years more wet when I

00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:47.480
 I put the one I indicated, right, the waiter for Inmetro was a critic, right, military

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:53.510
 smoothing everything put a colonel in the immense detail the Inmetro was in the eminence

00:19:53.510 --> 00:20:00.860
 to reduce from two to one year what the gauging of the chronotachograph speaks more

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.800
 loud that you for the betrayal of when you have colic and that there is here that

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.910
 represents in the pocket and two million truck drivers 400 more real each

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:12.830
 so every measurement with the reals it turned 22 and it would be done

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:19.670
 then this would be equivalent to every two years plus 400 is expenses so

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:23.339
 we put it and not 18 what it smelled like at the time I

00:20:23.339 --> 00:20:28.859
 know how to multiply 410 by two million just for truckers is another 3-pin socket

00:20:28.859 --> 00:20:33.889
 that the pepper I was preparing right

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:38.950
 well then a news here we work on holy week there in San Francisco São

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:43.690
 Francisco do Sul São Chico and the fuel collection and today at

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:48.100
 afternoon meeting with the Economic team ahead of Paulo Guedes decision

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:55.750
 Ours, as of March 1, now there will no longer be any Federal tax in the

00:20:55.750 --> 00:21:02.110
 kitchen gas Asia eternal so there will not be any Federal tax on gas

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:06.070
 of kitchen that is on average nowadays R $ 90 the tip of the line there for the

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:11.920
 consumer there and the price of the original one so to speak is a little below 40 already

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:20.470
 so you’re novena I’m 50 there SMS state tax and it’s also to pay

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:25.570
 there the EA distribution profit margin of those who sell at the end of there

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:30.880
 and we now have to have a rate way of showing the population how much is

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:35.740
 which is the ICMS of each state and then the profit margin of the distributor is left

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:41.299
 right and the value of distribution for people to know

00:21:41.299 --> 00:21:47.059
 and who is it really whoever is abusing there to sell

00:21:47.059 --> 00:21:55.549
 then the gas at the end of now what was treated now that Paulo César

00:21:55.549 --> 00:22:01.549
 an increase in my understanding here okay I'll criticize is a moment outside the curve

00:22:01.549 --> 00:22:07.519
 Petrobras 10% today in gasoline and fifteen percent diesel 4 readjustment of

00:22:07.519 --> 00:22:12.020
 year the scolding always comes above me only that Petrobras has autonomy and

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:18.530
 and when some agency makes any decision, it’s like back there

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:24.020
 I wanted to see the sun, right? She sent a way to talk about not having tea and

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:29.810
 those who make use of photovoltaic energy also wanted to blame me

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:35.540
 saying this is private is a decision that I have no way to interfere

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:40.520
 in it which is Daniel National Electric Energy Agency Gabriel decided not to

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:46.610
 charade then made life easier he has to invest energy there is

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:51.460
 here in Brazil and what was decided today from the 1st

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:58.770
 March there will also be no Federal tax on diesel for two months

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:04.750
 Saturday we will then for two months there will be no Federal tax upon

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:09.460
 of tithing because after two months we are both going to study a way

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:18.429
 to seek to zero this tax in Sisu even to help

00:23:18.429 --> 00:23:22.900
 counterbalance This increase in my excessive understanding of Petrobras but I

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:27.309
 I cannot interfere nor would I interfere in Petrobras although something

00:23:27.309 --> 00:23:31.120
 will happen at Petrobras It is in the next few days you have to change some

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:37.059
 thing there happen now i'm congress here the Colonel Girls who is formed like this

00:23:37.059 --> 00:23:40.840
 that I return Sisu by the Military Engineering Institute

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:45.429
 what his job and have a lot of stuff here say sh * t that quickly

00:23:45.429 --> 00:23:50.200
 speak for what it is used also very quickly present Inmetro is very

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:55.029
 known for that Face that looked like Fantástico to help the consumer of

00:23:55.029 --> 00:24:00.429
 consumer protection but it is a much more complex institute than that it has a

00:24:00.429 --> 00:24:05.340
 very strong arm of support to the productive sector both in technological research

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:09.580
 accreditation system to give confidence in products confidence in

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:14.950
 organisms that are going to do product inspections So Alex is assisting in

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:19.000
 Tariff barriers for the removal of tariff barriers various techniques of

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.960
 removal of technical barriers to trade so Inmetro he has an arm

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.730
 to support the functioning of the Market to have a very interesting arm of support

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:33.700
 to the productive sector in technology in innovation to prepare the productive sector for

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:39.549
 industry 4.0 you have the power to make life easier for the Entrepreneur of

00:24:39.549 --> 00:24:44.360
 entrepreneurs is to show the population the quality and

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:48.500
 efficiency every material that is on the shelf on the other hand you can I

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:53.270
 also be able to make life difficult for everyone as it happened in managements

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:57.230
 previous in part in my government until we realize is completing a

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:01.310
 Neto's year now that there was something wrong there I took it and said to

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:05.810
 intervention nor food the intervention even intervention will change everybody

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:10.790
 so if there are people who were there for a long time, there was a person

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:16.580
 which was also at the time of the taking, I entered time and that served to give

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:21.710
 a billionaire loss here in the consumer in Brazil all right now I will

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:26.000
 go back to the fuel you can already have a son whatever you want my son is we

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.620
 we did a campaign about 10 days to send invoices to

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:36.900
 people about gas stations

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:40.470
 we all started to analyze precisely how to post there in Rio Grande do Norte a

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:45.620
 thing that are all but not put the Federal tax there was the value and

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:51.890
 posted 10 So whoever took that note didn’t understand it right, look, I need to

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:56.630
 I'll show you the snake here every 100 liters of gasoline charges every 100 radios

00:25:56.630 --> 00:26:03.980
 charges R $ 45 and the State Governor doesn’t charge anything the winner is cool So

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:10.130
 there is a political factor the other that the note didn’t print the reality you will get

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:14.330
 the note of any other any other state you see that the price is charged

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:21.230
 this MS over an average value calculated in the fortnight so for example a

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:27.380
 liter of gas you go there at the gas station now it's $ 5 there are five are you boot

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:33.470
 so Hi 20 liters you put cereal you the cms is thirty percent the state

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:39.370
 get 50, but when it's $ 5 there it is

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:47.169
 embedded the price of the refinery the SMS the federal taxes that generally Jehovah

00:26:47.169 --> 00:26:51.340
 are two is one or two I can't federal the profit margin is distributed from

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:57.460
 distributor and the price also of the profit of the gas stations so the

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:03.880
 ICMS is charged is well to have raised this objective even in the ICMS

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:09.669
 of our project sent to the congress so that the one with phase So if

00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:15.850
 gather and decide the value of the ICMS on top of each addition of fuel how does the

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:19.990
 federal government for example diesel oil ours is the federal government charges

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:27.000
 35 cents per liter of good diesel then follow a path he puts

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.800
 400,000, which is not much for the truck, right? Boot 400 liters he

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:38.790
 multiplies by thirty-five cents 120 from the waist $ 140 right then $ 140

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:45.000
 I can Federal and it takes a shock right there you have to see how much the tax is good

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.100
 but Federal Talita the state presented above average the value

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:54.600
 generally As a rule the tax at the end of gasoline for example the state tax is a

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:58.590
 little more than double the Federal Tax so we’re reducing it by two

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:04.230
 months the value of the PIS cofins that I tax Federal the only one that exists in

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:13.380
 on top of diesel oil So this is this salad on the invoice that Who

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:19.000
 inspect if I'm not mistaken it's revenue so there was a meeting yesterday right

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.559
 a high level to believe present at yesterday's meeting there

00:28:22.559 --> 00:28:26.789
 if someone was present at yesterday's meeting who was very high, he missed

00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:31.289
 record that meeting, right, it's worth, right, autism level where we accuse

00:28:31.289 --> 00:28:36.659
 responsibility everybody nobody pays attention nobody pays attention to anything you

00:28:36.659 --> 00:28:42.730
 goes in the revenue you still do not inspect revenue because it is the case of response

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:47.830
 and I can’t get the attention of the National Petroleum Agency because the

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:53.080
 independent but has assignment also does nothing you go on up to the

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:57.669
 her job talking oops is not my obligation or how do I price Petrobras

00:28:57.669 --> 00:29:01.690
 the correction of a few days right I have nothing to do with the truck driver

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:05.740
 the price increases here I have nothing to do with the truck driver

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:11.799
 said the president of Petrobras, this will have a consequence Look, I don't have

00:29:11.799 --> 00:29:19.890
 nothing to do with it then you go I went underground Inmetro now it's ok

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:25.620
 working for some time now for a few months in a way not to

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:31.310
 checking starting ICMS is another collection of volume conversion that for many times

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:37.170
 you fill up your car, right? And you are in doubt.

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:42.750
 marker there 20 He entered whether or not he uses fraud nowadays Dias Speak some

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:48.300
 thing up to how much the percent more or less the volume up to a

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:52.830
 evidence come out of fraud and twenty percent of the volume around that so

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:57.330
 video boot guy I took us laugh But it's pro 16 in the tank Twenty percent

00:29:57.330 --> 00:30:02.590
 to give four lines ok if his car was economical 60 km

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:08.710
 and it weighs in your pocket and you don’t see it you know you paid and that

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:13.390
 car didn’t provide that service right appropriate if you take that distance

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:19.120
 so, for example, the quality is with Neto the volume of reception that he is doing

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:25.779
 of this so that this volume is actually placed inside the tank of those

00:30:25.779 --> 00:30:29.950
 paid for fuel at the gas station the sophistication of the coup reached the point

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:35.710
 so big that the fraudsters they go on the plate that makes the on the device that

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:41.190
 makes the transformation of the mechanical measurement of the rotating vane pump

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:45.789
 for digital which is what the consumer is seeing So the consumer is seeing a

00:30:45.789 --> 00:30:50.200
 as in fact it's already defrauded so Inmetro has been working together with

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:54.760
 the National Institute of Information Technology ICU of the civilian house will make the

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:59.260
 digital certification of these pumps the first object in Brazil until a

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:02.570
 digital certification this will strongly inhibit

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:07.820
 baby shower will make it possible to capture information not only on the volume if

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:11.659
 fueled amount being charged that this is going to be it for the other

00:31:11.659 --> 00:31:16.549
 agencies for np for IRS to be able to make all the theories about it

00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:21.740
 and you will be able to inspect the post and crazy or there at the headquarters food will be able

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:26.269
 inspecting the consumer himself will be able with his cell phone to help in

00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:32.570
 inspection and remotely Inmetro for information such as Sérgio as is

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:35.679
 of INMETRO in Xerém the headquarters of Inmetro is here in Brasilia and the technological center

00:31:35.679 --> 00:31:42.230
 soda you can here hello yours some people remotely inspecting

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:46.070
 the fuel stations with regard to the volume entered do not have to be how much

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:50.450
 time working on that proposal since I arrived in the year that you think

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:54.289
 that at first you can start to put this into practice the expectation

00:31:54.289 --> 00:31:58.190
 friend came from the King of the year the first pumps already certified depend on the

00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:02.580
 right of the manufacturer, bring this pump and approve it

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:10.500
 and I here only Frozen in double taxation the fraud in the volume of fuel and

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:17.430
 also in the quality of it is a billionaire trade you are

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:20.670
 understanding where I’m putting my hand in the bowl that I’m putting my hand in

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:25.890
 and then it is already that I do a poor job to find a solution comes some

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:34.230
 face there on the ship if you write [ __ ] attack Okay heart of

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:37.290
 elections there sell blanket Choose a better guy because it's full of good candidates

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:41.970
 out there not only for president I spent in the governor's okay you

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:46.350
 solves the problem now who goes to a page for us who treats you with

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:52.140
 affection're page to inform people to exchange ideas exchange

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:56.520
 suggestions is that you get upset when you go to write I’m going to write [ __ ] there I don’t

00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:00.900
 as a bicycle and fuel as it is because you increased the price of

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:05.460
 fuel has to know what's going on and you can collaborate I

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:09.879
 I want to thank everyone who sends me And there were hundreds of notes for me

00:33:09.879 --> 00:33:13.960
 tax authorities throughout Brazil, she was careful to supply the Brazilian government with

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:20.309
 request some criticized is because I can’t put 20 already this one I’m poor

00:33:20.309 --> 00:33:26.739
 stupid things that mistake is easier to do the account closed 45 of

00:33:26.739 --> 00:33:32.529
 tax up to 45 percent is getting dressed up to written thirty réis of state tax

00:33:32.529 --> 00:33:38.340
 that the ICMS and is 20 how can you Twenty percent

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:43.490
 out of 100 out of 30, just playing doesn't pass the discussion on

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:48.649
 play that PSOL to those people with that gun, right, solve that

00:33:48.649 --> 00:33:53.120
 people quickly resolve this account so always say it and nobody saw it

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:58.039
 it’s not for the president of Brazil to worry about being here below

00:33:58.039 --> 00:34:01.970
 up is from Inmetro you can see the appropriate answer with Tarcísio too

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:07.490
 I always had his support. You have to deal with this matter and it is not easy for you to deal with it.

00:34:07.490 --> 00:34:16.369
 on something that is used in Brazil all over, and the possibility of fraud of profits

00:34:16.369 --> 00:34:23.490
 millionaires to 11 billionaires from the other I said that there is a state in Brazil

00:34:23.490 --> 00:34:29.669
 still not polemic I will talk about the state is that the CCP rules the foot centered reasonable

00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:36.359
 of gas stations and this state authority does not seem to give

00:34:36.359 --> 00:34:40.230
 ball for it so I never went to the Federal Police we do our

00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:45.359
 work but it’s not easy for you to investigate it but it’s okay for that

00:34:45.359 --> 00:34:51.080
 Saturday I even need the fifteen percent salty news

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:55.639
 too salty but that's it is taking as you can take today

00:34:55.639 --> 00:35:01.400
 emergency, excluding the Federal tax and for a period of time for people

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.400
 think about really structuring measures for us to fight if the

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:09.589
 price volatility of the same then the truck drivers started from 1st

00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:13.760
 March the tax that has the invoice you I ask you to be a

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:21.650
 person that well is State is not Ours the price of high you who will say

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:26.810
 It is High or not if the sofa is here, the price of the Republic refinery is going to be here

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:31.520
 there is also a decree Nossa to be published there to oblige the posts

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:37.490
 fuels to put and the price of the refinery and put Federal that goes to

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:43.790
 diesel is going to be zero from March State tax is your Governor you

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:48.720
 see if there is a high non-profit margin for fuel owners and the

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:55.560
 below that of the fuel distribution we cannot some one who

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:58.920
 just want to charge the gasoline immediately the house also the Federal tax is

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:06.660
 high 79 cents per liter of PIS cofins and another 10 cents for Confins is 80

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:14.720
 Federal tax 89 cents a liter of gasoline each state has a percentage

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:21.840
 over the gasoline at the pumps did not decrease the value of that of the gas station

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:27.540
 gasoline is very difficult that every time we reduce it and we have to look for the

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:33.690
 the same resource in another location or create the new tax or increase or increase the

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:39.270
 another existing tax now that that we are going to do comes here the waiter

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:44.430
 make an average America has strength that the owner is serious will not deny it there but

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:51.970
 as an average we cannot say that it is in the rush rush moments

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:55.680
 percent of the fuel volume is just to bring

00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:00.510
 so this is worth more or less to give percent price of

00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:04.920
 fuel you really fill your tank with quality gasoline 10 see the

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:10.589
 collection of gasoline baptized water boto solvent other things there

00:37:10.589 --> 00:37:16.589
 to stay there Some obviously cheaper than gasoline So you will

00:37:16.589 --> 00:37:20.900
 paying a high price on the product product should be cheaper for counterfeiting

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:27.569
 Marcia has another expense you will have another expense on the carburetor that's right

00:37:27.569 --> 00:37:33.990
 help there i said carburetor all the car's explosion system

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:37.640
 car power helps in that area too

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:44.240
 I got it, let's get the one with the questions for today, there is a carburetor

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:52.730
 today too much Ferrari in our time had had to act and the distributor cap already

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:59.390
 we made her cheer up that I served has the sergeant re-appointed in that known as

00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:05.779
 sergeant the trigger then any mission the staff I special lieutenant right and the

00:38:05.779 --> 00:38:09.440
 older people always liked requisitioning him to make the trip that get out of the land

00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:13.910
 and because it helps the captive to break the throttle cable he

00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:19.519
 pulled his suitcase from Gato Félix He had pliers he had wire he fixed it right

00:38:19.519 --> 00:38:25.490
 if Gray was rolling today, right, he could find a way to put sandpaper in there

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:29.269
 he spoke more than looking at me the car dispenser cover also didn’t give him

00:38:29.269 --> 00:38:33.430
 solved the problem that heated up the kart he wanted to find a way to

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:37.650
 refrigerate that thing until a flat tire he gives

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:41.940
 I arrived back at the barracks. So, it’s worth noting that Valdo today is captain of the

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:46.559
 the game's there from Rio Grande do Sul to our Sergeant the trigger today

00:38:46.559 --> 00:38:52.140
 nowadays there is no problem right nowadays it looks like a television today

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.839
 up-to-date with TV we didn’t used to sell it changed the grandma to solve

00:38:54.839 --> 00:39:02.240
 today you have to change it there are components first question to him if he uses it if he uses the

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:10.970
 Hi good evening Minister Tarcísio struggles with the participation of the Railway Sector in

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:16.190
 Brazilian transport network by the end of next year and if you think

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:20.200
 that this will correspond to a significant reduction in the cost of Brazil

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:26.690
 thank you thank you there for the question that uses Rail transport is

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:32.180
 growing a lot in Brazil because we know but today 22 25 million tons

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:36.799
 of grain from Mato Grosso destined for export and already arrive at the port of

00:39:36.799 --> 00:39:41.329
 Santos Via railroad and this will be intensified now with the railroad

00:39:41.329 --> 00:39:45.490
 north-south that is completely ready goes into operation in the middle of the year

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:49.039
 President will soon be inaugurating a section as it is that until

00:39:49.039 --> 00:39:53.150
 São Simão we start building the Integration Railway until the middle of the year

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:57.019
 from the Midwest we will have this year the integration railroad auction

00:39:57.019 --> 00:40:02.660
 west-east the auction of ferro grain and we are offering a Railway offer in the

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:06.619
 system the participation in the Rail mode in the matrix will go up

00:40:06.619 --> 00:40:10.799
 gradually in we have 8 10 years and should double the

00:40:10.799 --> 00:40:14.190
 people should go from fifteen percent to thirty percent and every time they

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:18.299
 the new railway enters the system, we add transportation offers

00:40:18.299 --> 00:40:22.049
 obviously this will have a repercussion in the post just to have an idea in the

00:40:22.049 --> 00:40:27.930
 passed with the paving of the 163 to the freight to the North arc dropped 26 by

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:31.920
 percent pushed the freight all down because the railway operator who's

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:36.180
 doing for example Rondonópolis Santos you can see that road freight was there

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:40.140
 cheaper and it lowers his freight Rail we provoke

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:44.010
 promoting competition between transport furniture mainly with this

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:49.260
 strong entry of the railways into the system this will actually lower the cost considerably

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:53.700
 Brazil is to have freight reductions there in the first moment the next five years

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:59.869
 that will hit 25 thirty percent this should reach 40 50 in ten years

00:40:59.869 --> 00:41:03.850
 the course prepares second question Only curiosity is Green Piece

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:07.230
 and is against reducing

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:13.839
 and the price of elastic diesel as it’s high enough to discourage

00:41:13.839 --> 00:41:21.109
 this type of fuel is what would be the alternative of the report page but it is

00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:26.140
 I benefit there against the truck drivers is another question Augusto far

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:32.279
 the minister she

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:40.790
 It is possible to recover money from the vase on behalf of the government

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:47.330
 and thanks Augusto thanks for the question The North-South Railway So she

00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:50.990
 now has three plots that will be ready recently the first one was

00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:55.730
 ready now in december it's starting to operate which is the stretch that goes up to

00:41:55.730 --> 00:42:00.770
 Estrela do Oeste to São Simão the second to Rio Verde is ready in April and the

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:05.210
 last that until Anápolis is ready in June So it means that from the

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:09.560
 end of June to one operating The entire Railway that will then connect by

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:14.630
 type here right there in Itaqui the Carajás railway goes out it connects to

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:18.500
 north-south railroad in Açailândia goes to the western star of São Paulo where it

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:22.340
 hitches in the Paulista grid that this year will receive a two bi point of

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:27.860
 investment already in the den of the extension and we will double the capacity then

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:30.530
 in July EA we will have the north-south railway operating we will

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:35.570
 see commodities we go from general cargo containerized cargo transportation of

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:40.770
 Bistek container, right, that personal stacked container is going to come there a lot

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:47.070
 and send forever and this recovery of the stolen resource and then I

00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:52.440
 I think that a little bit of what we’re experiencing President is as much as it was

00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:57.360
 stolen from Petrobras, right, because in the end they stole money from Abreu and

00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:02.850
 Lima stole money from Comperj stole money and from the prizes of

00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:08.520
 Maranhão and Ceará do Ceará stole passadinha after all is us

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:14.120
 we were dependent on the imported derivative, we could already have a

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:19.440
 self-sufficiency and refining we did not have due to what happened

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:24.300
 working hard with aggeo on asset recovery every day they

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:29.760
 pretty much announces a new money recovery deal and really

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:36.660
 that we will see the freight falling there with the railroads

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:40.560
 we will change the dynamics by trucker trucker will go to work on

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.000
 that the buildings that give me return for

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.030
 kilometer traveled we will also see the truck driver earn more money

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:49.590
 transport logic there changes

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:55.510
 and I Augusto was from the beginning of the story here in our check to pass Live this

00:43:55.510 --> 00:44:01.690
 refineries' loss was over 200 billion reais in a detail around

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:06.820
 25 percent of the saying that we use here comes from outside and its price here for

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:14.859
 people to see if they sell below the market, right, people will not, will not

00:44:14.859 --> 00:44:18.580
 sell it to us here so we can resell it here at a lower price than

00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:25.000
 everyone would not make a profit So this diesel price also takes into account

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:31.780
 in addition to the price of the barrel outside the dollar in here also the market price of

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:36.640
 diesel if it weren't for those three big refineries that were announced

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:42.490
 right, with a lot of pomp back there working, we would not have this problem of refining the

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:48.190
 Brazil and detail our refineries that stopped on average 20 days a year to

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:52.940
 proper maintenance 40 days a year because of Invite

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:58.040
 one more problem and then Petrobras claim that Jesus I am not I am the

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:05.120
 Petrobras if we do not increase the price here at the refinery right

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:09.770
 which is the tithe goes to the refinery but as if we had naria we can

00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:16.160
 causing the shortage in Brazil and the appearance is worse than inflation

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:21.710
 so we’re making it possible was Federal as announced just now we’re going

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:25.700
 zero all federal taxes on diesel for two months as we seek

00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:30.890
 an alternative as we will definitely see from March onwards all

00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:36.470
 federal taxes on gas reduce so we are looking for alternatives and

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:41.600
 showing the population what we're asking another question is

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:43.660
 What's up

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:57.000
 Marcelo Mattos is replacing Victor Bravo I would like to ask

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:19.410
 for you are we are Marcelo is approaching and we will be successful

00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:25.680
 let's take the month of April For example right We will have on the 7th of April

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:29.580
 auction of 22 airports on April 8th auction of the Integration railroad

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:34.350
 west-east on the 9th of April 5 Port terminals on the Twenty-Nine

00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:40.920
 de Abril auction of br-153 in Goiás Tocantins on the 10th of June auction of

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:46.590
 163 For the one we finished after 47 years and then the

00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:50.710
 auction of 381 in 262 Espírito Santo auction of Nova

00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:55.180
 Dutra that will be a tremendous auction on April 30th has Cedae auction and the

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:58.780
 that we perceive is demand and the investor's willingness to enter are

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:02.620
 realizing good opportunities we will see this at the airport auction in the

00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:08.140
 day seven even with all the crisis of the aviation market the demand for it

00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:13.360
 put is great so it is a sign a demonstration of confidence in Brazil of

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:18.100
 correctness of our structuring of our economic policy of our policy

00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:22.270
 for the structure and really the investors are betting on our

00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:26.560
 country and seeing that here we have everything that the market needs potential for

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:33.370
 growth and stability in contracts is a large consumer market and

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:39.280
 excellent low returns lacking on the day question brought in to prepare our

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:46.210
 social networks Facebook YouTube Instagram has 82 thousand people watching right Pingo

00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:51.140

 social networks peskitos go there the Picos dos rios and follow the end there the closing

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:15.710
 that Augusto Luso's team always gives to our physiology

00:48:15.710 --> 00:48:19.750
 questions Zé Maria José Mauro Speaks Zé

00:48:20.559 --> 00:48:30.540
 good night i wonder if this rise in fuel prices has any

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:35.910
 and interferes in your ministry, it is possible that they are contributing in some way

00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:43.800
 way there to at least stabilize fuel prices thank you I think

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:49.110
 who is the president spoke here on live, you have this president of zeroing the

00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:54.750
 Federal tribute right decided this after a meeting with the Minister of Economy in the

00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:59.490
 on fuels for on on diesel oil for the next two months to give us

00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:03.870
 time to prepare right to move forward and structural measures right We will

00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:07.440
 working on the electronic transport document that should be a revolution in

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:11.610
 transport sector because it will make the trucker bankable will allow

00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:15.120
 that he has here will eliminate intermediates from the process will increase

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:20.580
 the income will decrease the loss of money with an intermediary and also decrease the

00:49:20.580 --> 00:49:26.190
 transaction cost we have the question of the medium truck driver who is in Congress

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:30.390
 which is a project that is being a priority and greatly reduce the value of

00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:32.500
 with The Trucker and give him a breather

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:38.470
 also and a perspective of the future makes it more competitive in relation to the

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:43.930
 fleet owner is we then have to the study of the fuel issue this

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:48.810
 that is being taken into account so there are some alternatives for

00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:55.570
 cushion this volatility that comes in the foreign market so we are

00:49:55.570 --> 00:50:01.180
 working all possibilities to make the cost of transportation and lower there

00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:06.550
 the life of our steering wheel professional is especially easy there we have factors

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:12.420
 Zé Maria is also external and it’s when it’s winter

00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:20.650
 excessive as you are seeing for example in Russia a consumption where edigard of

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:27.760
 fuel oils stayed to give consumption beyond the normal is the demand being a ro

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:34.480
 price rises it seems that Saudi Arabia is now about to return to increase its

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:39.010
 production this can lower the petal price off now has the dollar here

00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:43.750
 inside the DOC inside the high ones I don't know how much closed today, you know, but it's still high

00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:50.490
 it is necessary to pass the House R $ 5 and low how do the reforms with measures

00:50:50.490 --> 00:50:59.170
 structural elements that can awaken more than attention is the security of the

00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:02.839
 investor and no one will buy anything here at

00:51:02.839 --> 00:51:08.930
 Brazil if it is safe I will invest I don't know if I put the return

00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:15.079
 so we are going to do what we can, she is expected to be God

00:51:15.079 --> 00:51:20.150
 want Chrome here soon the market conditions and the dollar lowering

00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:25.240
 low fuels now had screens right across Brazil that are responsible

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:29.990
 why we speak here you with that one is not worth it because what is just that

00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:36.650
 goes above the profit I have no heart but if Brazil there does not engage in a

00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:41.570
 good way everyone is going to lose it is better to be alone everyone win a little

00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:47.720
 less right and for a longer time than that guys for a short time that the

00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:52.099
 loss will be us Gerson present from Inmetro one thing says there the novelty will

00:51:52.099 --> 00:51:57.380
 learning from news always has good news, right?

00:51:57.380 --> 00:52:00.180
 working very hard on the agenda of the principles

00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:04.920
 the name goes through then we apply the risk rating as suggested

00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:10.500
 not placed in the Decree that in practice several products that previously had all

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:15.599
 bureaucracy to be approved today this approval of automatic no longer has

00:52:15.599 --> 00:52:19.260
 the approval bureaucracy continues to have to obey all the rules of

00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:23.160
 security then does not affect security but within the risk rating it does not

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:26.790
 had to stay a bureaucratic process to prove this product by

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:29.950
 this gives more security and boosts the economy too

00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:35.349

00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:40.570
