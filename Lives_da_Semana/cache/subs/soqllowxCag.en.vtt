 always admired I have said the fifth meeting now to

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:35.130
 little right is Brazil is in the last decades elected people who did not have much

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.090
 be careful with the public thing to be educated, you know those people who once

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.670
 President Lula thought everything paid for everything and corruption was the issue here and

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.100
 also people who respect the united states

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.360
 me more than us perceptive profound admiration for this state here

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.680
 so much that as there are people who walk I came here for democracies as there are people

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.420
 wanting to see the government say come on but in a legal way make it very clear leave way

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.229
 illegal in the valley and dictatorships and see when they want to leave the country and the group

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.909
 dictator does not leave the case of venezuela the people want to come out well when cafes in the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.750
 border there lets no one out it is impressive that the staff left

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.570
 that defends Venezuela so much does not say that the border is open to

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.490
 sympathizers of the pc of the pc of the psol b if you want will live in venezuela already

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.590
 who like this regime but what matters here in the united states in

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.670
 exceptional acceptance was born we were treated very well in my

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.430
 surprise when I arrived in Syria aleppo side so a wall named maman who

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.770
 it was written there in English obviously neither john 8 32 and you will know the truth and

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.170
 truth will set you free I was very surprised by that there I

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.090
 I was inspired by the bible our campaign game and not obviously it was

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:04.500
 get a medal for signing up and going around here about john 8 32

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.860
 there we had contact with the presidency as well as employees the most

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.610
 varied at the top, right?

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.310
 their concern with laundering money with terrorism with venezuela with the

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.470
 issue of the political shell and he is interested and we also because it changed the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.930
 ideology we don’t have any more partners right it’s filtered to ideological things don’t have

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.500
 more life wanting to partner with the whole world

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.270
 expand our business as far as possible excess market are open

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.720
 we have here attack on tereza cristina beer sheva culture

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.100
 very concerned about an agreement being signed between brazil and china today

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.110
 approximately in the next few years it can obviously reach 20 million

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.990
 tons of soybeans in the united states to china and this will have a reflection

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:04.770
 of the 12 15% I don’t know in our soy exports if that

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.560
 trade here if it becomes a reality we have the meat collection here too

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.290
 they want to export ethanol to us we have a 25% tax even paper

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.130
 boy obviously the fee was the complement to the Brazilian its united

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.270
 the 2% american rate to enter the brazilian is 25 most skeptical são paulo

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.450
 ensures that the discussion goes is logically we have the northeast there that

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.310
 would affect the northeastern market a lot but look at the big problem in Brazil

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.920
 it is in these 25 14% are extortionate taxes charged in brazil and veplan

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.400
 complain about me right look the states have the power to put

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.430
 embu charge fuel icms on average in brazil this same reason in 30% the

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.640
 municipalities also have a mechanism to charge more varied taxes and produce a

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.190
 great tornado brazil we talk about making a tax reform so that the

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:05.160
 difficulty that one has 28 years of the chamber I always saw this discussion when it arrives

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.680
 us finally or when the state union and municipality will lose the benches

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.630
 represent these sectors is opposed and nothing is approved this is another

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.269
 serious problem that will go beyond social security

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.960
 we know that pension reform is tough and you know that

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.910
 i would not like to do it but if i do it here antónio frazão breaks brazil

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.400
 the one who receives nothing logically to the congress is not the one who has the authority

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.870
 have the freedom to do this to make some adjustments and hope that there is no

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.230
 readjust right but the congress has this power to do

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.180
 some readjustment on one more thing is very clear on if Brazil does not make a

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.760
 pension reform in a robust way we will break the example is there look at the

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.400
 what happened in portugal and greece belief also reaches a point that the

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.330
 government to pass a ruler from now on and half to everyone will not

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.500
 receive if you don't win will be cut nothing has arrived yet

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.170
 the problem is that we are facing the pension reform

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:12.720
 would like not to do will defend something else from a problem in the proposed

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.110
 military reform can only be sure

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.000
 that's the proposal is going to be fair the military commanders personally the

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.980
 defense is I talked to him at length yesterday after that in the first

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.600
 negative impression of that proposal that I didn't know about yet

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.910
 signal her mind is not done yet the big problem of the figure of the

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.780
 Sergeant Major would even like you to speak up

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.500
 about issues manifesting that comes to me is that the figure of the

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.360
 good sergeant is another graduation there between the 1st sergeant the lieutenant the

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.640
 sub-official did not fall well that ask for some advantages in the matter of the promotion

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:59.250
 that uniform help that weighs but it’s not really that good and we’re

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.090
 accompanying we obviously want to do the best right

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.430
 taking into account justice and only that these will also be increased by 5

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.919
 years contributing to the time spent in the military gradually

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:18.570
 for transfer to reserve i would like that to happen too but it is a

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:24.150
 reality and we're going to have to do that now what we want is I surrender

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.930
 defense as a great force the rest was military that are with me

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:33.919
 we never thought of privileging one side over the other and the union

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:38.850
 of officers and forces squads but as a whole and this will be maintained our

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.900
 government that who obviously have this as

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:49.090
 very important for the maintenance of democracy guaranteeing our freedom is

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:54.250
 because there can't really be possible privileges that we don't

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.300
 intention in that proposal is going to be perfected is something with all the

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:03.700
 the defense continues to work so that this proposal reaches the chamber in the

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.900
 wednesday i will arrive on wednesday and dawn and brasília we will have access to

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.550
 proposal now in a polite way after reading the proposals that everyone in the

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:17.230
 military area of ​​the armed forces it is easy to come to our knowledge of your

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:22.060
 immediate superior that he follow chain of command he thinks he can win the

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.070
 that he thinks can be changed because I'm sure there will be

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:31.050
 sensitivity on the part of the defense ministry to correct is possible

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.110
 misconceptions that can happen we are human beings can happen there is no

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.180
 trophy doubt ask the question will you go tomorrow after the white house will not

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:44.920
 only goes to an arlington cemetery will deposit a wreath at the grave

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:49.720
 of the unknown soldier you can make a

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.320
 I'm not even going to talk about a comparison, but talk a little about how it is

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.980
 treatment of the military here the police forces respect for authority

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.460
 American here in your books simply

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:05.440
 you are proud of the american people on the streets the most american because the

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:10.840
 treatment given to the military here does not even compare with other countries and even

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.780
 in relation to brazil know that the military brazil any research of

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:19.330
 helipe fipe first second marcia her place as institutions her beloved

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.990
 best rated aeronautical navy army right

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:26.740
 we have the respect of a large part of the Brazilian population

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.560
 it fills us with pride because I'm still the captain of the army

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.800
 Brazilian now demonstration here exactly one

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:38.410
 country here has been at war almost always at war is not fighting

00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:45.730
 participating in the peacekeeping force to your loved ones has to really be preserved

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:50.680
 in the world that we lived in a world that we don’t know but there are countries that have the potential to

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:56.350
 destroy the world there sometimes so here the armed forces are

00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:01.960
 respected and we have spent over 30 years of fhc government actually with the

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:07.330
 your loved ones being mistreated in the collection of material in the salary correction if talk

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:11.970
 in pension reform we have a provisional measure and originally 2131

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:18.610
 since December 29, 2000 turning 19 now turns nine without being

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:22.840
 voted yet we will resolve this issue now it have been withdrawn

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:26.860
 people claim the right went to all of them military, not even in court

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:30.940
 we could we could get in because the heart came to justice judgment

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:34.210
 visa spoke look is a provisional measure can not decide if mandela

00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:40.750
 and the judgment and dispatch is that way now I usually say when you complain about

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:44.290
 military is such a privilege career that I don't know son of

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:50.440
 deputy and senator who joined the black needle academy with this

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.530
 weapons or pensions agenda and guaratinguetá

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.830
 I was unaware until then, people criticize a lot, they are not all right

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.770
 the ball had quite advanced tool

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.920
 we have worked with the eastern military command

00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:08.710
 the southeast comes as we consume defense has already taken a big step in building the

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:13.360
 military school node in the mars field in são paulo and also the defense already makes

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:18.700
 studies so that each state capital that perhaps does not have a college

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:24.400
 military whatever it is then a military college is created in these capitals of

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:29.260
 state that we want with this, of course, the enrollment is voluntary

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:35.500
 and obliged to put his son in the military school, he follows a suitcase, right?

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:42.310
 discipline where it is really present is even the most imitation

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:46.030
 is later in colleges militarized by the military police

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:52.560
 is where for example it is very big in the state of goiás and amazonas now have in

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.790
 ale at the end is given the double arriving in January also a militarized school

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:02.560
 blica x is mayor washington even i want to thank you here because it is

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:06.250
 how was his work together with my son as a state deputy

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:10.840
 flávio bolsonaro and put the name of the school there to see if it is the general of the employee

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:15.640
 father passed away 95 thank you for the mayor's face and painted

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:20.860
 on the wall and I asked him that I went to the inauguration put João 8 32 there and

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:25.420
 you will know the truth and the truth will set you free that we have to enjoy

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:32.860
 now in the minds of the kids it is true the love of the homeland is to say that it will only be

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:36.910
 happy in the front in the economic part if you care if you study now don't be

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:43.630
 waiting for the data to take into account touch me ahhh here unbelievable we had

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:54.790
 there it is with dinner time ring almost at the time of the domain of citizenship ours is

00:11:54.790 --> 00:12:03.100
 what happens is he did a survey is of 3 thousand families who receive a scholarship

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:09.640
 family three thousand families of Bolsa Família guard crowded from 0 to 3 years and

00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.400
 these kids were followed for some time

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:16.180
 it was concluded that the intellectual development of this

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:20.560
 kids from 0 to 3 years old son of family scholarship

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:26.770
 their development is equivalent to one third of the world average is a minutiae in

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:32.020
 land so it's only a third of the world average

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.280
 it really gets difficult and even with good schools you can make this

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:42.520
 kids that get it wrong back there and have the ability to make 11 a good

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:47.440
 school a good university being a good professional up front

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:53.650
 are the problems that we have out there we start to change is not easy right

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:58.450
 the ministry of education is largely responsible for these for that matter

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:03.070
 now the rigging is present in all

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:07.180
 almost almost all institutions in brazil do not know what goes on in the heads of

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:12.100
 people think that communism socialism is able to work

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:17.800
 as I said just a short time ago, you see, in Venezuela, socialism failed

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:22.359
 there it worked so well is that I'm passing

00:13:22.359 --> 00:13:26.619
 hungry eating rat getting barbecue dog has more to eat

00:13:26.619 --> 00:13:31.239
 the people who defend animals, right? I also defend there, there are no dogs or

00:13:31.239 --> 00:13:35.139
 cat eating more everything because it is applied socialism was very well

00:13:35.139 --> 00:13:42.009
 implemented by chavez and the player pure beauty of the ballad dined and west of

00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:11.319
