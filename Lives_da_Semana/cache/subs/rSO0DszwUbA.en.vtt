00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.730
 approved it is just a post close to the fourth obviously it is also in the center

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.829
 geographic is student live direction of hotel be the hotel graph right

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:13.799

 understood now in september we are going to inaugurate the two were after the year

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.000
 past that these points were chosen according to the sensations and

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.600
 divers dive so the dash is player did the course of

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:56.560

 pavarel interest captains do one of the question course is not

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:11.320
 and I remember the flat electrical apnea of ​​the building falling on its feet fixed the two

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.220
 ankles back then I use them down here called bring them but what

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.840
 he changed his name now we’re going to finish the horse the plagues he’s going

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.770
 take in the donkey cumbuco as the best of the calcaneal the animal but if you as well

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:37.420
 the radio club spent the second is mine and down you veterinarian the

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:44.950
 ah it's the message here it's ok it's a news here just hit me right no

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.660
 leave it there you are not here I was not going to be suspending right guiding the

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.770
 suspension of the hydroxychloroquine tests that I'm

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:59.380
 immediately third avenue was the party

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:06.370
 killing more looks made one of those differences larinha is called coca-cola right

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.790
 there in manaus pick up people who are already in a serious condition, right and quite elderly and gave the

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:19.540
 dose three or four times over the limit obviously the man without percent the

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.130
 another one that was not complemented right then it turns the error and now the ms

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:31.300
 said again that it can continue right the result to continue the protocols is

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.100
 research on hydroxychloroquine odelete says that you allow me to

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.060
 I think it is important we are and this decision by the STF is based on a

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.919
 study published in the lancet magazine of a very prestigious magazine and only that

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.850
 no one appeared there nor did the studies of speaking and anyone who in that

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.500
 would encounter a series of problems a series of methodological flaws and everything

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.789
 more and you and your supporters pointed out these flaws and when they did

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:03.110
 this when called upon the science of negationists and now we were in the

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.740
 true the earth planet earth hard and this for you do not want to want colastrina

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.340
 people he what happens I know I didn't know the guy said he is for

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.810
 now believe it’s just that the doctor’s not the parachutist does a lot of things

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.039
 in the choke you know a lot of things in this okay I always said that there is proof

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:25.310
 but there is no other remedy, right? What would the new remedy be?

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.270
 chloroquine and what I say you don't want to take don't sleep put no problem

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.520
 I will not force you to speak if you are a certain age

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:41.470
 and get the virus you will stay there in the hospital there maybe it has to be

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.759
 intubated and who knows you know the number of people that ciça was not so

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:50.199
 big like that then people on the side and not taking age and disease into account right

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:55.300
 how to give me this chance to put it is very small now we have reports that

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.610
 a lot of people saying they felt good after taking the hydroxychloroquine that

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.960
 to take it does not want to do not disturb who wants to take it after all right

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.490
 you are playing with the lives of others on top there is a chance that the person will

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.919
 cure with colatin lets regret the pressure of 10 days or 12 some

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:20.009
 were a senator from pt filed a petition at tcu for

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:25.810
 stop the protocol of the general and it is easy for him that our interim minister

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.370
 sandra, what’s the point of this, there’s something else okay, you can deliver to

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:37.999
 will but he has no let and will take take it is he who decides the

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:42.259
 his future I say to you my mother is 93 years old has five more

00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:48.169
 siblings everyone is warned already if she has a problem, get a doctor there who has

00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:53.269
 a lot of favorable doctor regarding her she will take creatine I will not

00:07:53.269 --> 00:07:58.429
 leaving my mother is to heal alone at this age, right and very debilitated

00:07:58.429 --> 00:08:03.259
 physically present it is also worth saying that all these studies they seem to be

00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:08.569
 done in bad faith all medical researchers who lego the effectiveness of

00:08:08.569 --> 00:08:12.409
 hydroxychloroquine he said the following needs to be done in combination with

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:16.729
 azithromycin in combination with zinc in the first five days these people I

00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:22.279
 early use all of these studies escape the test of that connection ie whether they

00:08:22.279 --> 00:08:26.089
 they really want to demonstrate effective I don’t need to test the one that’s

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:30.379
 being supported by the various protocols are being applied here in Brazil by

00:08:30.379 --> 00:08:33.510
 example to prevent senior in others who have already

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:38.430
 the chief is breaking a record of cured patients but he always runs away

00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:43.680
 the tangent increases a dose and do not add azithromycin or put it there

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:49.800
 already in intubated people as your good said is yesterday a motorbike circulated without the

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:56.430
 knowledge of health maize allowing there I loose and and taking into account

00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:01.110
 in view of the pandemic situation that Galilean obviously noted, right, it has already been detected

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:06.780
 with the person who made the note it seems it was in bad faith to apologize the

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:13.590
 language to make fun of even the note circulated and the manager I am against the

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:18.750
 abortion as far as it depends on me will have no taste in regard to the conversation proof of the

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:24.810
 ours underneath difficult to see a meter and then I complete and whether or not the

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.350
 I veto this note now, she was unaware of the public health environment

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:33.640
 and eduardo passed an error contact us last night we did a little

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:40.180
 tin cans ignorance and says we did then another fake news is all the time

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:45.600
 people trying to overthrow us and the people inside the ministry of health

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:51.520
 published in published there you found it in the morning but it's a story here but not

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.720
 was obliged and doing it was also upset with what he works with

00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:02.290
 Sunday to Sunday and it obviously gets in the way of us going

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:08.319
 fake news is a lie okay okay so the abortion collection of

00:10:08.319 --> 00:10:14.129

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:26.330
 of repression in the history of Brazil has never before had such an effort to

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.270
 bring the Brazilians to not leave anyone behind we know that still

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:33.980

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.790
 a large demonstration has several much richer more powerful ones that have not yet

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:41.810
 managed to do what we are doing a huge effort from the staff

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:44.819
 then yours from the tourism staff and above all from

00:16:44.819 --> 00:16:49.799

 Brazil as an example of approaching the tourism crisis today our country that is coming

 santiago de amorim that always the second world war was 39 to 45 right

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:35.429
 Brazil later entered the war but had and was decisive in the fields of

00:17:35.429 --> 00:17:42.270
 battle of italy what he fought nazi-fascism nazism and fascism

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:46.710
 those who do not know what fascism is then keep talking here accusing the other of

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:51.270
 patience become similar because we are very simple fascism is the opposite of

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:57.450
 his tarcízio government advocates knows great social control of the media to

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:02.130
 catching a motto for perhaps more consecrated fascism is all at

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:06.320
 state everything in the state nothing out of the state you have been defending what

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:12.540

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:23.430
 they use terminology just a linguistic trick there a ruse that

00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:27.450
 he always taps people who are looking to say favorable to

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:32.160
 democracy and accuse others because they are accuse others who are

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.340
 it’s an old tactic it’s in some countries like this it’s named

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:41.380
 gender democracy there are several one that Germany's democratic last

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:45.789
 there are several different dictatorships that call themselves democratic republics and if

00:18:45.789 --> 00:18:49.330
 we just go by the terminology so we will believe that one to be the

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:53.740
 equality if democracy means equality or without reason but you didn't take

00:18:53.740 --> 00:19:01.840

 the 2000 war went up to 400 on average smart

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:52.100
 the street and these people are that this program

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:58.100
 government that your money is not mine known as a voucher corona or

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:03.740
 emergency aid and 600 is already matheus you personal essentials I know it's not

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:07.940
 a lot goes i can't see ya

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:11.580
 ip you will pay the rent you will not pay

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:15.420
 electricity rent will not pay in the region there is no way to pay anyone

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:20.280
 is encouraging not to pay there was no way to pay ok we had an aid

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:25.080
 for these people, giving a limit of 180 this energy bill with the

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:33.270
 here is the federal government there is garbage for you to say animal I'm going to pay for that there

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:36.720
 many measures have been taken by the government to aid micro and small

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:41.340
 small businesses also don't know central surpasses so far

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:46.950
 more than 600 billion and the government spent put ships imagine if it could spend

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:51.450
 600 billion with health as a whole you would do all the details brazil

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:57.890
 I don’t know why it’s proven but not feasible for

00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:03.680
 to be champion in this matter of using public money, right?

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:09.470
 andrade council ok it was hundreds of billions of reais for health states

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:14.810
 and municipalities some months municipality some state used only adequately

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:19.880
 goes with others not a pleasure for operation there in Rio de Janeiro irregular

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:26.180
 but imagine 600 billion who was going to buy wonderful health supplies

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:31.790
 I would be in the hospitals, right, but it's okay, so we're doing

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:38.180
 I can play a part I cannot dictate a policy so that states and

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:44.750
 municipalities is a better attack on this collection of viruses that are the responsibility of

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:49.640
 exclusive of governors and mayors well right governors here for the love of

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:53.250
 god but still running after people in

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:59.460
 and I think it was foreseen today is the general advocacy of the union in the predicted is

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:04.710
 I know what the technical term looks like, it’s favorable that its the beach, right?

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:09.840
 I know the interest will be in the detail of the vitamin D you take takes you win

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:14.760
 more than 15 taking only water ice will get into that there understood life maybe

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:20.520
 speak the ministry of health goes to say that it is the beach ok she can

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:24.360
 being I feel that depending on the union can only interpret it so if someone enters the

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:28.350
 justice from tomorrow you are published today or tomorrow that similar

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:35.820
 we will already have the union already know that the federal government is going to be the favor pillar

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:42.900
 again that person is to go to the beach now the judge there from each city you know

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:47.340
 will receive these these va these madara security who will decide if the

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:51.660
 john can go to the beach or not i don't see anything too much for the beach until ask

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:55.340
 one and takes the people with board in the

00:23:55.340 --> 00:24:00.200
 beach one now lets you catch these measures are adopted by the respective

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:05.900
 governors and mayors and the second supreme federal court does not compete there

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:11.540
 is to decide this issue is something even more present about the

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:14.960
 Santos follows are using this terminology I think the important thing to

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:20.120
 people to point out every Brazilian met in 2013 the black blocs that were

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:24.830
 responsible for a major riot broke everything vandalism aggression and even

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:29.870
 even the death of a cameraman if you remember she uses january was the

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:34.280
 santiago santiago da bandeirantes used some mattresses there some

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:40.340
 explosive and ended up murdering that person who at the time did not have

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:44.570
 clear commotion but no one criticized the vandals who were doing there

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:50.690
 that whereas today any criticism that is made press already has it

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:54.950
 a big a big drill the big complaint in contrast to that

00:24:54.950 --> 00:25:00.800
 happened at that moment even immediately do not speak party there is no

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.780
 problem in justice right everything has to prove but they will appear immediately

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:08.550
 two lawyers to defend those two

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:16.890
 the protesters so that when launching the rocket burst on the naked nape of the santiago is

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:31.200
 journalist who died for him and his family I thought he was a lawyer

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:59.340
 who's paying you doing it here at the hospital and

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:05.610
 I'll even bring only more about complementing so what's the trick here

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:09.030
 and claim to be anti-fascist because evidently everyone is opposed to

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:13.950
 make it easy to say anti-racism before you for anything you say that

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:17.520
 be a bad thing the person already speaks pow I can't stand against this group

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:21.450
 because you put me against that group i'm going to be fascist so they do

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:26.550
 this all with the words more tricks and their methodologies are exactly the

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:30.870
 same in the black blocs see for example what is happening in the united states the

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:35.970
 their terrorist activities they have committed acts of vandalism against

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:42.570
 synagogues that is to say showing a clear position against the Jews as

00:26:42.570 --> 00:26:47.250
 Germany's fascists in the past for example they have vandalized numbers

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:51.510
 private property of other blacks and have already reached the height of

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:55.650
 assassinate some blacks including a retired colonel who will do security

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:59.350
 card of the capital claimed to make the security of one is

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:07.450
 the [ __ ] also has to die the videos of black women of black men of

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:12.190
 black transsexuals and those like to talk so much about the improvements showing there

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:17.500
 o the balance of these acts of vandalism broke down looted stores looted

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:21.520
 establishments leaving these people practically would do most of them not

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:26.470
 will be covered by insurance, that is, every trick they use they use to say

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:30.309
 that there is a concern with blacks is false that it is concerned in fact with the

00:27:30.309 --> 00:27:34.870
 blacks is police who are protecting their establishment is police who are

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:37.870
 there defending these people so that they are not attacked or

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:41.950
 murdered but they use this trick for me to lord the people who

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:46.390
 we are watching at home I was afraid to put myself against them because the

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:49.539
 we do this I say look you see this way we do it they put

00:27:49.539 --> 00:27:54.490
 against us soon he is does it so it is what jesus in the center if he is

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:57.789
 against us here he is racist already does that with the people who are at home

00:27:57.789 --> 00:28:02.990
 can't fall for this trick which most will not fall for already learn

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:06.440
 the list back in 2013 and how much the company was telling you it was all

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:10.850
 peaceful your part of the company on that land a legal part of them this

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:14.960
 then watch them for a few seconds and use maria I think we

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:19.580
 we do transmitting the broadcast here a hug was curious that your profile

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:27.850
 now you’re going to change the arcade there using the present surgery, okay, congratulations to

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:34.460
 her for the exemption from the journalistic work of you so just so as not to

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:41.510
 generalize there is a very clear difference there that it is too much to talk about your

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:45.830
 to the movements this card in são paulo even had to vote for the senator from pará

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:59.340
 clapping right candidate for the next day in paraná and it doesn’t work it’s not

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:05.340
 and the guys were there playing his role selling terrorism unfortunately not

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:09.870
 here is to stay with a theory is not that it took off if that of the organization in the

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:15.210
 past and we have yet to believe that there is a having difficulty approving the

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:20.670
 project in that sense for sure and we respect the law the laws they don't they

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:26.040
 they do everything outside the law do everything they can and everything is beautiful right and on the other hand not

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:30.420
 so it is expected to imagine in the face I think it is sleeping there was no corn is charged

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:36.060
 I never put anybody in any movement. No, I'm not on the third day of my life.

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:41.010
 social life I thank all those who participated in what the movements is

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:45.240
 patriotic the current year is in the mentally the other for a track there

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:48.960
 but weird has nothing to do with democracy but it's his right too

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:53.960
 the track comes back there is the noise that makes what, right now

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:58.730
 Sunday now these people are scheduling at the moment I do not speak I ask all those

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:03.560
 you can follow and do not participate in that moment is stay at home go

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:08.480
 look close but don't need to let him use it show let me show

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:14.030
 only them, right, what is democracy for that? I’m not hoping to have

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:18.740
 break-break not but history in the days that these black outcasts here

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:23.960
 good with english punch with dagger with iron bar the molotof cocktail usually

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:29.180
 he always asks what in the banks small train stations and other things more

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:35.510
 understood is obviously and I don't want to talk about what makes you sure right the power

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:41.210
 of your power and with you the governors are you committed to the democracy of

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:47.120
 truth for the construction of the laws with the family a kiss of the population is if

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:52.320
 preparing to see how to act if these people

00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:59.489
 personal another pass there ó the limit of the present rationality two observations

00:30:59.489 --> 00:31:04.079
 about you didn’t comment on the tracks that appeared there in the demonstrations

00:31:04.079 --> 00:31:08.339
 for the government and for part of the press as you said it was enough to have a

00:31:08.339 --> 00:31:14.579
 track a track over there giving 5 defending article142 they condemned all

00:31:14.579 --> 00:31:18.349
 movement condemned all the people on the street saying they were all

00:31:18.349 --> 00:31:21.959
 anti-democratic now we see a different attitude

00:31:21.959 --> 00:31:26.609
 people breaking down setting fire to assaulted and the press is very careful to speak

00:31:26.609 --> 00:31:30.509
 look but it is only a minority island and on the condemns movement if they do not contaminate is the

00:31:30.509 --> 00:31:35.969
 movement I peaceful beautiful moment and even when I was on burning the

00:31:35.969 --> 00:31:40.319
 flag do other races than the Brazilian turn on the television there in

00:31:40.319 --> 00:31:45.569
 great ninja in general what he will find are journalists saluting these

00:31:45.569 --> 00:31:48.519
 movements without I am never in the including the word poly

00:31:48.519 --> 00:31:54.339
 is completely from the end of the quarantine isolation they forgot the

00:31:54.339 --> 00:31:58.690
 social distancing from wearing masks is now no problem because it is a

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:04.299
 cause here the left supports it so everything is ok and then a question that I have

00:32:04.299 --> 00:32:08.889
 done it that you have also done for a long time is like these people who

00:32:08.889 --> 00:32:13.209
 now defend these manifestations I will explain to the people who lost

00:32:13.209 --> 00:32:17.169
 jobs that their companies had bankrupt that they could not leave home

00:32:17.169 --> 00:32:22.629
 to work for the flashlight and their livelihood but those who are going to the street

00:32:22.629 --> 00:32:26.589
 now I started acts of terrorism can come out under the applause of the press itself

00:32:26.589 --> 00:32:30.549
 the question remains is that I think the thoughts criticize me the sofa corner

00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:36.999
 on the move okay i'm old right and i went there only criticized now this is

00:32:36.999 --> 00:32:42.960
 that does gathering are also not criticize only that I already see the time right

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:49.049
 the most important hotel that your life is your freedom ok you just want to steal yours

00:32:49.049 --> 00:32:53.640
 freedom and situation has nothing to offer you you get the password this is it

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:58.890
 look at the conversation part of the study just put it in the corner you want to take the test even theirs

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:03.899
 right I think no one gets five so I don't know I don't want to squeeze you

00:33:03.899 --> 00:33:08.880
 you know nothing are idiots it’s no use now I won’t give advice daddy

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:14.549
 lucas our father can make the most possible mistakes to exercise control over the

00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:41.080
 the children do not leave some one and not in argentina in the body

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:45.790
 smash smash why I left no I don’t know if there’s no right on

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:49.180
 Argentine woman will go out and say that we are already there, we’re amazed that

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:55.450
 you can't color it raises avenue populations much worse because our only

00:33:55.450 --> 00:33:59.710
 Argentine is a complicated debt that is almost priceless there and few

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:04.570
 prospects of victory the Argentine people are our brothers but this week is a

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:08.800
 reality how are you doing in venezuela are you tired of knowing how it is

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:13.330
 we are in venezuela we want to get to the situation we are in

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:19.030
 venezuela our economy hers sign of recovery electronic invoices

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:26.470
 higher and more than what was opened, more taxes were collected, it's starting to

00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:31.000
 give signals to our economy more sells car also make tourism down

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.700
 at least the internship is complicated even more, we already have some

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:42.710
 small breathing activities and of course those measures that the governors

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:47.629
 they will take in particular left-wing people I will see what the enemy looks like

00:34:47.629 --> 00:34:52.819
 what did you do to come and hit me, right? I’m going to talk about economics

00:34:52.819 --> 00:34:57.710
 federal you these are not all numbered I repeat are all that the mother

00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:01.640
 company is going to be criticizing the governor who despite this press here

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:07.579
 brown plate there will be a job that was destroyed has no more chance

00:35:07.579 --> 00:35:13.400
 retrieve hotels there that the mall was closed I had photography of some

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:18.950
 things from the mall here was messed up all lost it's not easy to get it all back

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:23.509
 get the economy back when it was before you have to wait for the governors there to

00:35:23.509 --> 00:35:30.650
 rational way with master my opening speed moto is trade because

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:35.030
 is and what it is really did many people

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:38.750
 isn't that telling me that many people who were poor turn up

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:43.309
 poor and middle-class people and become poor and if the picture

00:35:43.309 --> 00:35:46.819
 real that is in brazil and i see governors some some governors

00:35:46.819 --> 00:35:52.640
 doing to hit the chest and prolonging another quarantine is 15 days you me

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:55.690
 call in mayor sao paulo but don't need são paulo

00:35:55.690 --> 00:36:04.450
 it's just a little more 15 days at home you have money even an employee, right?

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:09.790
 can stay another month of hair a considerable part of the population does not have

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:16.390
 one more reason what to eat the good news wasn’t I was talking here the reserved

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:23.640
 there after people playpen thanks to god some newspapers são paulo there it was

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:55.440
 thank you chat there and they want to accept the invitation to knock on the door and

00:36:55.440 --> 00:37:00.180
 good and you see the situation that the poverello is in gives no one else

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:04.890
 it's holding on longer until the side effect is much greater than

00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:10.829
 those people who unfortunately losing their lives there placement of

00:37:10.829 --> 00:37:16.230
 last three months here the rodrigo tv incidence of a news

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:22.619
 here the death of more waiting for the second world war pedro rossi already

00:37:22.619 --> 00:37:28.890
 passed away from the night of day three yesterday at the age of 99 he participated in 20 missions and

00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:34.369
 only itanhandu and I just have to thank here the

00:37:34.369 --> 00:37:41.070
 god soda at night does it in italy fight i am nou am beautiful

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:46.530
 this is another hero we still have little they live in Brazil we even have

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:51.420
 little time I had the hair glue owner of itapemirim in bed to the federal deputy

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:55.620
 decision message for him was very touched right be it miguel making

00:37:55.620 --> 00:38:02.430
 mount a castle that he does if it is even he said the hair glue that the

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:09.420
 letter of surrender from the German division which he took to the chief than the

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:17.000
 operations here were the mask of more than 30 yard exercises

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.220
 marshal mascarenhas that led to its fourth edition

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:26.580
 and I think it is alive with glue hair not yet in this life yet but

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:30.990
 I'm leaving and the chance we have honored and now while in life

00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:37.400
 they are great I am sorry here the payment of one more proof colleague here

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:44.820
 pedro rossi try to photograph him our salute that I for rock come

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:48.480
 I think it’s worth saying that anyone who calls these movements

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:53.369
 terrorists the anti-fraud anti-fascists resolve the memory and

00:38:53.369 --> 00:38:56.910
 in these heroes that have to be more honored more recognized the best

00:38:56.910 --> 00:39:02.790
 almost 500 for second world war based the troop of approximately 25 thousand

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:09.540
 500 lose left their lives on the battlefield of italy is it origin

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:13.210
 of my family bolsonaro culture and pardini

00:39:13.210 --> 00:39:19.759
 and my genealogical family is part of it

00:39:19.759 --> 00:39:26.479
 it’s one more thing that I just doubt it’s yellow green people that have to have

00:39:26.479 --> 00:39:32.329
 God at heart who has a patriot and thinks of his country, which is conservative,

00:39:32.329 --> 00:39:38.630
 that work that are liberals who believe that brazil can change to

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:43.999
 better for work is not staying at home is not worth it I will not attend this

00:39:43.999 --> 00:39:49.459
 movement that these people have nothing to offer us anything too good

00:39:49.459 --> 00:39:55.069
 too much is too much there are addicted or without saying as varied as possible is

00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:58.669
 that doesn’t match the majority of Brazilian society they want turmoil

00:39:58.669 --> 00:40:04.339
 I want a confrontation until a few days from now in Curitiba with break-break is in

00:40:04.339 --> 00:40:09.589
 the next day you can relax I didn’t even have wanderlei silva fighter

00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:14.869
 of our founder to alleviate right is he made a summons and believes that we

00:40:14.869 --> 00:40:19.680
 below and some 3,000 Brazilian patriots go to most of Curitiba

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:25.440
 I went there at the government's square there to raise the Brazilian flag with lots of

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:31.319
 honor the flag of Brazil that these criminals in black, you know, taking people in

00:40:31.319 --> 00:40:37.020
 true the black blocs had burned two days ago before burning the flag of the

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:41.799
 your country and that's the adjective here because I

00:40:41.799 --> 00:40:53.340
 I am not a bad man, ok, it’s just one, it’s one thing I already think it’s worth the

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:58.500
 people started here every now and then come back projects there to supposedly combat

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:02.550
 fake news and you’ve talked about it here several times but just a word

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:07.800
 What we are seeing at present is a clear attempt to criminalize

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:11.970
 your supporters fighting that nobody explains what fake news is nobody shows it

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:16.619
 what rivers would have been made in favor of the government but what do they try

00:41:16.619 --> 00:41:21.150
 deliver a narrative that everyone who defends the government the easy you are

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:26.369
 controlled there or supposedly the oil cabinet is the biggest fake news in the history of

00:41:26.369 --> 00:41:31.920
 Brazil also the press invented a very stupid rebound performed quickly and the

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:34.980
 idiots believe that logical others still believe here today that I want

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:41.580
 gamedroid present me an offensive story to whoever it is that has

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:45.840
 helped gave seeing as lies is because even during the campaign during the

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:49.240
 campaign was accused by the sheet of são paulo rapid a car

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:54.060
 it's fake news against pt i spend 12 million rest outside of brazil

00:41:54.060 --> 00:42:02.140
 joke all the reals of the campaign 12 million little is already fans of

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:07.030
 staff donation issue now that helped in the campaign so the millions of

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:11.710
 people who go voluntary if they want the material made a t-shirt went to the

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:19.869
 public roads resulted our name is i thought i was a different one from

00:42:19.869 --> 00:42:24.369
 too, you know, we really got the sound of losing no more, all right

00:42:24.369 --> 00:42:31.170
 arrive as truth using even a biblical passage from john 32 elected us

00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:35.920
 then had action judged in the supreme haddad it was when wrong that he went to have

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:41.680
 power the mind is measured I can put people who

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:49.000
 use at dawn wake up, right? I even how much the woman can sleep if I stay

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:56.300
 me and leave alone and I will look for the

00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:02.440
 side here so I liked the

00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:13.640
 oh everyone's laughing he has to write down anyone from Pernambuco

00:43:13.640 --> 00:44:04.840
 believe me is i think not build is going to have a

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:08.530
 good surprise it won't be long

00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:11.730
 great part has some

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:21.839
 with this help here it seems a little bit here with regard to that from there already

00:44:21.839 --> 00:44:24.510
 I also don't know that the fourth and fifth rentals will not be settled

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:29.310
 emergency aid portion is going to be less than I know center to go

00:44:29.310 --> 00:44:35.819
 exactly leaving for the end here doesn’t give that every time we pay here

00:44:35.819 --> 00:44:43.319
 o this emergency aid is almost 40 billion reais is more than the three

00:44:43.319 --> 00:44:48.000
 months of Bolsa Família the state can't take it there gustavo non-taxpayer

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:53.099
 now I can't take this one so it will stop giving up and it waits for you to

00:44:53.099 --> 00:44:59.069
 trade goes back to work informal ones go back to work as well as other

00:44:59.069 --> 00:45:03.420
