 medical recommendation he thought to enter and also signing the consent form

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:03.500
 responsibility is several municipalities in Brazil are getting in touch to leave

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:08.690
 of request since we have so much time we have we have provided we have received

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:14.930
 from the unit lab we also receive donations from outside and we serve

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:20.630
 when the order is the municipalities ask and we deliver it so that the doctor can

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:26.900
 prescribe as long as the patient also accepts this prescription and then takes it there

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:34.550
 correct doses indicated and the relation to that drug observation in the

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:37.680
 expects life to his orientations he is very

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:43.650
 of course we tried to support the doctor because we talk about it, right in the system

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:49.680
 unique health that god we observed about 2 months ago that many doctors of sus

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:54.720
 were prescribing chloroquine hydroxide and other drugs without

00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:00.600
 some kind of position we have guidance from the ministry of health and by

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:06.330
 other hand, several more humble vulnerable people sought care in the

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:12.270
 sus and some sus doctors also did not prescribe that there was a degree of

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:16.950
 guidance from the ministry of health the ministry of health picked up all the

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:21.480
 medicines all medicines that were being used and prescribed

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:27.230
 since the beginning of the pandemic the three an orientation on the best way to use

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:32.850
 avoiding self-medication the best best best time to use each medication

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:37.899
 what dose in which country and that drug would not do more

00:15:37.899 --> 00:15:45.040
 effect or it could have bigger side effects too this is aa this is the

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:50.200
 main guidance regarding the use of medication we have no self medication

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:59.440
 always being able doctor according to is within the prescribed doses evaluating leaving

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.550
 the doctor to assess which patient is the best medicine for

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:07.720
 it be medicines which is better some to a medicine has excuse has

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.890
 patients that it is better to use a type of medication that is not suitable for

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:16.180
 another patient because of that we have to remember one thing

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:24.250
 diagnosis is sovereign of the doctor so sovereign sovereign vote so this is the

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:28.870
 number one guidance from the ministry of health today we changed some

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:35.120
 orientations are now your previous ones that at the time were the best orientations

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:42.080
 the ministry for the day of the academy was that it was at the beginning and it was thought that it was

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:48.770
 better the best procedure was to stay at home or having no symptoms and

00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:53.360
 when in the picture aggravated with shortness of breath and other things look for your

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:58.430
 doctor this initial guidance was not effective what when the patient

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:05.150
 I was already short of breath at the doctor, I was already serious, sometimes needing to be

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:11.150
 intubated with invasive ventilators and this intubation procedure with

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:17.089
 fans he showed himself with a degree of resolvability a degree of solution

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:24.890
 very low so risk of you dying from there it was high so we

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:29.620
 we verified during the pandemic that the best practices they were other

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:35.100
 best practices of early treatment the early conduct of the doctor with my

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:41.490
 I agree we guide the patient every medication and it will be fine and if

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:47.490
 in case it gets worse he has to be monitored and he will quickly receive

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:53.010
 the respiratory aid which is that oxygen catheter nose to mask

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:59.280
 and this will allow him to pass the contamination period and stay

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:04.380
 good that they needed to be intubated, so this is the big change that I think

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:08.460
 that we always need to speak the Ministry of Health puts this of your

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:15.900
 very clear website our website is the health point gov.br it is on the internet

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:20.280
 so it's available to the whole world and it clearly has us

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.879
 alright portuguese think you are with invite

00:18:23.879 --> 00:18:30.359
 and what to do is just click it will be all written what you should know about the color

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:36.299
 2019 just click everything is written so these are the observations as soon as

00:18:36.299 --> 00:18:38.849
 i can talk about it you will continue after it is open to questions

00:18:38.849 --> 00:18:45.299
 there the augusto ronar zé maria who uses avoided degree to take advantage of the tasty someone

00:18:45.299 --> 00:18:49.769
 passed your zap he’s a figurine it wasn’t me who spent a look there

00:18:49.769 --> 00:18:56.369
 I was called a little while ago and it’s worth it until I hit this sticker there

00:18:56.369 --> 00:19:02.409
 in yours in your zap is it is well if you are going to say right you don't want

00:19:02.409 --> 00:19:08.740
 bathing what depends on his will and the average income does not

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:15.340
 I understand prohibit asking I will talk to someone who wants to take care only

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:21.580
 we still don't have a vaccine in the square and we don't have a proven remedy

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:28.929
 scientifically and when you use certain medications that you can use there for a

00:19:28.929 --> 00:19:33.700
 having it once is not in the ass it's called his high right is a tea out of the recipe

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:39.039
 mind ok many diseases would still exist in Brazil today without a cure if the

00:19:39.039 --> 00:19:45.700
 even if I had the freedom to work outside the package, okay?

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.620
 people a seam has been successful

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:53.880
 in several people in the circle of friendship among others here also has a mandate

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.720
 video for me that follows on social networks that tells what happened

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:02.550
 with you but if god is waiting for this, be free of it from here at

00:20:02.550 --> 00:20:10.020
 moment here is a little light with a young man with a young pan news 88 live white I

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:14.330
 on facebook youtube 40,000 I'm losing him

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:19.309
 and take a cloak from the gang there from augusto nunes, but it's only if my signal

00:20:19.309 --> 00:20:24.070
 of iron and pass to young pan while this live ends the young pan

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:28.490
 there until seven o'clock until 20 o'clock go inside here you have

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:34.399
 then look at the length of criticism or praise or not by a priest this one for him

00:20:34.399 --> 00:20:41.940
 augusto nunes mania is used in stained glass I go there we heard from me now

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:45.940
 little is almost 9 million lost their jobs in

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:49.840
 second quarter of the peak of paneleiro in the second semester does not have to

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:55.480
 keep master is male April May June almost 9 million people have lost their

00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:00.190
 job I was already talking about we have at least two waves that a third

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:05.440
 also the collection of life has to be concerned with it so it's after the

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:13.179
 question of the session that many people of this also say certain that this effect

00:21:13.179 --> 00:21:18.009
 collateral is more serious than that of the giros itself, it's just talking about time

00:21:18.009 --> 00:21:24.039
 some some time ago there the economy is recovering health no I don't know

00:21:24.039 --> 00:21:28.840
 if you have to make the game an arrival account you cannot be closes everything

00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:34.090
 look here let's see the region of rio grande do sul now right now that the

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:37.989
 videos I was hitting there now it's four months closed will close more deadline

00:21:37.989 --> 00:21:43.330
 it has already complicated the entire economy of rio grande do sul will compromise and today

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:48.009
 I saw a video an audio I don’t know if it’s true or not very prefect it was

00:21:48.009 --> 00:21:51.309
 god so we mayor of the capital also that opening the governor does not want to

00:21:51.309 --> 00:21:56.739
 another seeing a certain clash there in the south is that some mayors and

00:21:56.739 --> 00:22:01.419
 governors with the policy of the bloc such we will close everything but expect a

00:22:01.419 --> 00:22:04.960
 a little bit it's just me I went to the second round with another guy listening in the

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:09.369
 presidency imagine that other guy had won do you think he would be

00:22:09.369 --> 00:22:14.999
 supporting these measures of closing everything stays at home fine he is on the street

00:22:14.999 --> 00:22:19.809
 handcuffs who are on the beach or looking like the police are similar to ours although

00:22:19.809 --> 00:22:24.050
 with all due respect, the supreme federal court ruled that the

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:30.670
 relapses are the exclusive responsibility of governors and mayors then

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:37.130
 unemployment largely some governors to mayors have this

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:42.050
 responsibility what day will we stay open question then will you give time

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:46.410
 here and the class there of the young woman to do a

00:22:46.410 --> 00:22:50.540
 comment there coming that is criticizing we have no problem

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:56.490
 in this 20 o'clock here so we have four questions right boy you can

00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:04.400
 answer I answer do one is tomorrow it's just you live god you want

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:09.720
 in são vicente right and on the bridge there are two barreiros barreiros

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:17.040
 oe together with rosana valle ok seeing finally those of that work

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:22.650
 that so much disorder brought the population of são vicente santos and region first

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:26.660
 ask some some bids

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:34.970
 and then hi hi

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:44.700
 the most affected and least affected and what am I huh

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:51.310
 and then my friend really is the most

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:57.340
 important was the desire for better the same dedication of everyone you are in

00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:03.460
 war effort everyone is focused on trying to win this war every

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:09.520
 managers at all levels are trying at the beginning you had one I ended up

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:14.910
 to put you had a protocol and that protocol brought many problems

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:21.730
 let's go quickly the managers started receiving these guidelines and started

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:27.040
 to adapt seeking to make the quick screening

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:31.860
 hello to everyone who was sick with symptoms and from then on diagnosis

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:39.370
 thus reducing the end of the queue the arrival at the respirator then the

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:46.530
 first thing i saw very good was the attendance of sport screening is

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:53.760
 immediately the was a thing that the techniques are also non-invasive

00:24:53.760 --> 00:25:00.880
 using the ones that even the girl to put the patient's back on

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:07.330
 upwards to facilitate breathing peace of mind are equipment for

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:16.240
 also facilitate breathing with oxygen and adapted structures in the

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:21.580
 hospitals themselves expanding this ventilatory support unit I believe

00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:27.020
 that these relate to treatment in relation to the management of the patient

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:34.210
 and practices of the worst practices, of course, have shown the reverse of that which is

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:41.210
 focused only on ICU and patients waiting at home until these conditions are bad

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:49.180
 are the two big differences we see is we also have managers who

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:57.690
 were distributing medicines to the population even without a prescription

00:25:57.690 --> 00:26:03.750
 that is, one side of the thing we also disagree and we saw managers who didn’t

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:09.270
 distribute the medicine by its own opposition team's own positions

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:14.880
 also and the ideological that was also otherwise wrong i think that what the

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:23.240
 people need to keep in mind is pragmatism is the lack of not really having

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:28.140
 differentiation from nobody all Brazilians all together and we will

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:34.500
 with that win this war and a favor you if you could you can comment the

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:42.240
 right, the denial of the medication to those who are ill cannot be of a

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:48.220
 decree of the governor or mayor and who decides I am a citizen is passing

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:54.490
 maury is short of breath has a fever a tired is a doctor does not have to be in

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:58.960
 decree today you will find the boy several state decrees there of

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:04.030
 cid governor or most beautiful mayor of your retina any other medicine

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:06.710
 or any other medication does not have to

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:11.510
 which takes in the bahia for example the governor the simple event foreseeing a

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:16.370
 serious problem in porto Seguro a doctor there who asked for the medicine to

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:21.020
 people, right, I don't prefer whether or not any order that comes from us

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:25.190
 knowledge play there for health the patron's team who decides this

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:30.890
 thing but my god in heaven cannot the decree of the governor of this is of the

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:36.440
 peace inside the front what popcorn is this what business is this is a decree of the

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:40.760
 mayor fawning over the governor following the guidance of how I'm going to do

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:45.110
 who hard she is going to take or did not understand doctor and period another

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:54.310
 asks if he is right josé maria trindade i

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:57.460
 and there and there

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:05.000
 what if there was an ah I don't know when

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.989
 [Song]

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:16.710
 to be lesser question months is there anything could have been done by the ministry

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:20.240
 of health by the federal government

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:27.250
 and then hi friend I think what needs to be

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:33.130
 of course is that everyone dependent on those who are at that moment he has to

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:38.200
 be focused on doing your best to do what created in knowledge

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:42.610
 at that time, at the time that the Ministry of Health at the time that the

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:48.480
 managers we executive find solutions or discover better things

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:53.320
 quickly we change quickly the movement protocol changes

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:58.550
 a guideline so what can I secure

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:04.520
 and the death curve of the number of deaths it does not need to be directly linked

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:08.690
 to the number of contaminated number of contaminated depends on a lot of

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:14.450
 factors own ignorance of the virus of the form of contagion of this virus to

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:20.030
 the speed of counting makes it impossible for us to predict

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:24.830
 exactly every curve now the death curve not great man has to do with

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:30.740
 how we deal with the patient who took it and really became symptomatic and

00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:38.230
 really got worse so this case is exactly this is how it is done is

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:45.480
 and what will change and what can change the death curve is you apply the

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:51.669
 the learning as fast as possible the learning I already said before the

00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:58.419
 answer that we changed was to see the doctor immediately the doctor so

00:29:58.419 --> 00:30:04.540
 sovereignty for your diagnosis and will prescribe your medications take the

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:09.640
 medications immediately and keep cattle to the doctor to be accompanied

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:15.190
 if you get worse you should and with an initially supported structure

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:21.610
 ventilatory system does not necessarily have to be intubated with the catheter with the

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:27.880
 that you can complete the general and complete cycle without reaching the need for a

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:35.559
 respirator if we knew this at the beginning of the year we had all the

00:30:35.559 --> 00:30:41.600
 necessary certainties to take and surely the ministry would have taken

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:47.809
 this position then the positions also depend on the learning curve and it is up to

00:30:47.809 --> 00:30:53.000
 the manager at that moment to evaluate the new ideas of making the decisions of

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.130
 change and implement those changes we will have in this second stage now of

00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:02.480
 pandemic if you understand that the north and south are two very different stages

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:10.490
 northeast of the country and was impacted there in the beginning of March so far in

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:16.070
 June was a great impact on our Northeast and now the impact of the Center-South

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:22.450
 Southeast Southeast and Midwest Some cases that we will have the upsurge

00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:28.580
 increase in cases and thus the need for greater treatment in these

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:33.679
 states because of winter has to do with winter in the south this is the time

00:31:33.679 --> 00:31:38.220
 the number of cases increases, the cases increase, we don’t have a single

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:44.789
 dinner now the treatment of the sick yes and I can guarantee the lords of

00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:51.539
 the south of the country is certainly clearly following these positions that I

00:31:51.539 --> 00:32:00.210
 I put here to tell you about a treatment is to take advantage of the samaria the protocols

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:05.350
 usually serves as the north which the doctor of sus I will not say that it is a

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:12.130
 bible this as the north the people of mandetta management were there in the protocol and

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:19.340
 this drug here hydroxychloroquine could only be applied in severe cases

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:23.900
 good and we had information I went through one but he has a doctor

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:30.320
 saying that you applied in the beginning and he was radically against and that the focus

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:37.010
 I don’t know what he is, his professional what I wanted to know about him,

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:41.960
 the suggestion laughing was imposition my suggestion is to release it to a doctor

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:46.860
 decide whether a serious condition or not applying this practically

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:53.040
 good then with you talk there boy could have been avoided you can only avoid

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:58.230
 deaths of people with comorbidity or of a certain age only that falls completely

00:32:58.230 --> 00:33:03.090
 recluses a lot of everything and even then she can get a video people somebody will

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:07.980
 bringing her some food is a good newspaper she puts her hand on the handle of a

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:14.460
 door and affection is contaminated for you now like adventure this here if

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:19.320
 check later when we have the day before yesterday in the Italian study saying that

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:24.840
 greatly reduce the number of eggs for those taking hydroxychloroquine and taking it early is okay

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:30.270
 those people who banned in the big hand in the tethas that guy who

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:35.280
 won the dictator of the state where the whole municipality is not all are not using

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.940
 everybody not in the big hand until the documentary we have is everybody here

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:45.510
 these people have to answer because you liked it based on what evidence

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:49.240
 scientific you went and it may also be that later on you

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:53.460
 prove that this growing up santana effective like that or even effective patience

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:59.080
 happens we have to make a decision we have the doctor no less he takes

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:04.120
 decisions when talking about her doctor listening I didn't speak drawing a hundred more

00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:08.290
 meters you have there accept death if something could have been avoided around here

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:13.450
 then see that there was then I boats bridges here our minister of science

00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:17.770
 technology has invested in has the scientific name even known as anitta

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:24.599
 it looks like god and appears according to google verification not second test

00:34:24.599 --> 00:34:32.700
 right, people committing it worked too, so that's it, okay, we have to take

00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:37.049
 decisions your chief executive officer like editor in chief of the newspaper hence you

00:34:37.049 --> 00:34:42.450
 it must be a seam right something happens take up a line that is not it is

00:34:42.450 --> 00:34:45.899
 well that with the passage of time here also happens but we have to decide

00:34:45.899 --> 00:34:50.309
 we have you order the news and here we have to press passed your with the

00:34:50.309 --> 00:34:55.049
 society has no medicine and no vaccine, this is a good thing, saying that

00:34:55.049 --> 00:35:00.509
 no problem I asked now that the minister is in it today all the itamaraty

00:35:00.509 --> 00:35:07.109
 itamaraty right is to inform me for real at together ambassadors like in africa which

00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:10.579
 it was the amount of dead in each state because she just took it right here

00:35:10.579 --> 00:35:16.410
 will also ask our ambassador to india also for the number of

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:20.890
 eggs there are a billion and four 300 million inhabitants

00:35:20.890 --> 00:35:28.150
 I am poor, right, there are many, many and many energy are people that you

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:38.980
 many, you know, call it back here you put glasses right and the number

00:35:38.980 --> 00:36:07.119
 of deaths can underneath and listening

00:36:07.119 --> 00:36:12.320
 and there and there

00:36:12.349 --> 00:36:17.930
 that this drop is not is really those votes were

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:22.960
 registered as invitation 19 as the ministry of health

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:26.870
 and there and there

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:33.029
 the people who died competing which completely changes the perception of

00:36:33.029 --> 00:36:36.170
 population about

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:44.240
 is a blouse well the question is very good because it moves to another position

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:50.570
 inside the ministry of health that practically defined that it could only give

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:58.730
 with the case if confirmed if it had the test then he this position she

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:06.530
 took away from the doctor his sovereignty to make the diagnosis so moment that the doctor

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:12.619
 could not make the diagnosis, this treatment was done with a

00:37:12.619 --> 00:37:18.050
 diagnosis of an indeterminable disease in many cases a syndrome

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:25.970
 severe acute respiratory and that kind of thing so when you don’t have you don’t

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:32.430
 have the diagnosis of corrid if you have to treat without diagnosis

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:38.440
 when you have no diagnosis, if the person dies, there is the fatality of

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:48.160
 die and will also be buried with a disease and a half is undetermined or

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:56.640
 maximum respiratory ah and will not have put there invite and

00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:02.700
 with that we would not have the correct notification being placed so when you

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:09.780
 do not have the diagnosis from the beginning what yes or no you can slip

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:15.690
 for both sides to treat a person who has no invitation as an invitation

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:21.510
 how to treat a person who has invite as he does not correct and this makes the

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:29.099
 data become very difficult this is this is the real reason for us to have

00:38:29.099 --> 00:38:34.119
 difficulties today to evaluate people who were not invited

00:38:34.119 --> 00:38:39.789
 it is but like that pandemic and that situation was epidemiological data

00:38:39.789 --> 00:38:45.190
 they were confused the doctor ended up asking how to actually correct you

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:52.589
 said pneumonia forms so the lack of clinical diagnosis supported by exams

00:38:52.589 --> 00:38:59.210
 laboratories supported by imaging exams in the epidemiological concept

00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:06.920
 and this basically the and draws from the feet are done in the correct way and in the

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:13.070
 correct time what you need to understand the test is only effective with two types of

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:19.700
 test the test has a quick test the serological test it will check if

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:24.380
 you have the antibodies and this has only been effective for anything

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:31.970
 after the 14th day where you will understand and you are already asymptomatic and you are already with

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:37.910
 antibodies before that give you results of all kinds which confuses the

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:43.369
 diagnosis and logically confuses the multiple test treatment that when

00:39:43.369 --> 00:39:49.820
 mp-pr and checks if you have a virus is the same if you are not under

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:55.190
 medical follow-up with the diagnosis from the beginning the time of the test also

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:59.559
 it's wrong it only works from the fifth day on

00:39:59.559 --> 00:40:06.489
 and until the 5th day you have a virus and the zero test from the fifth day to the day

00:40:06.489 --> 00:40:10.839
 sorry alberto and change the commandments he will give you the position that

00:40:10.839 --> 00:40:15.099
 you have a virus on the fourteenth day of the fourteenth day at your house today

00:40:15.099 --> 00:40:19.949
 will have will be lower the test can again have an answer

00:40:19.949 --> 00:40:27.180
 inadequate then the tests are for the doctor to complement your diagnosis

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:32.430
 as long as you are accompanying the patient and that moment that must be done

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:41.289
 so I refute the own is say the doctor’s impossibility at the time

00:40:41.289 --> 00:40:45.939
 put that way of making your diagnosis of your follow-up to

00:40:45.939 --> 00:40:53.289
 these and fixes the difficulties of having exactly the reason why

00:40:53.289 --> 00:40:57.720
 who were killed because we lost Brazilians there due to various types of disease

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:04.960
 and if you use only personal ah I understand your action remedy

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:11.410
 questioning I have fewer people, right, dying of a certain disease than

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:16.600
 died last year well it's mousse this is credited to the invitation ok he has

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:21.580
 three four five community is elderly and regrets i am ah ok really situation

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:27.130
 quite complicated and I personally die with the video is not a rule

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:34.600
 this but in some cases some doctors the little bit an autopsy is also that

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:40.180
 boot invitation in some cases have come to the attention of us okay in the

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:43.480
 power that are reliable sources but this information arrives for people 15

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:48.180
 little one and it's an autopsy okay then it's an

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:52.470
 difference already saw your motives matter there in the young pan in the dangerous go to

00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:57.809
 song to die with the invitation, you want to see another community added sometimes

00:41:57.809 --> 00:42:04.440
 the age of of convert I saw published in the official journal of the state union nec

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:09.529
 responsible for the responsibility of the governor of the state of são paulo is

00:42:09.529 --> 00:42:15.390
 saying clearly translated there in that publication that the doctor at the

00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:21.240
 verify whether or not it could be verified in practice if it is that the video is not for

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:26.460
 put an invitation so sleep over some there I don’t know what interest in some

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:31.289
 runners give 6 to walk in that direction, you know, bring more panic to the

00:42:31.289 --> 00:42:37.049
 population as it’s killing more people are dying than what we

00:42:37.049 --> 00:42:41.069
 we can do in this matter there is no medicine there is no vaccine so

00:42:41.069 --> 00:42:48.190
 regrettably people who do not get and even get the vaccine once against

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:52.750
 viruses will have a great chance of getting complicated and even then it now leaves

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:57.520
 suspicious, you know, just just what you said that other communities are not going to

00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:02.549
 there are also a lot less people in the past and that counts everything for the curriculum

00:43:02.549 --> 00:43:09.339
 to talk about a problem presenting an idea, right, but modern, growing but active

00:43:09.339 --> 00:43:13.339
 complement then is adding an idea

00:43:13.339 --> 00:43:23.089
 who is this this all this exit what will happen to us right what

00:43:23.089 --> 00:43:28.479
 that has to do the the flowers the fleas have already gone up have come down from the north northeast

00:43:28.479 --> 00:43:35.809
 of course, just look at our graphics, which are updated 24 hours a

00:43:35.809 --> 00:43:42.349
 day online you are there at our health point gov.br locate sus and you will see yours

00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:47.299
 city ​​its state its metropolitan region and the interior of the state

00:43:47.299 --> 00:43:54.109
 exact curve of contamination and deaths and you will see which is your rich will see

00:43:54.109 --> 00:44:00.680
 whether the measures of your state municipal manager are compatible with the risk

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:06.720
 you see in the curve itself so let's understand that the

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:12.809
 habits ah because I can still go with existence

00:44:12.809 --> 00:44:17.730
 of the different coronary cell coronavirus for all of us but we will see that

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:23.160
 normally we will wash more siblings we will wear a mask sometimes inside a

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:28.410
 airplane where a lot of people are closed in the air conditioning when the guy sfiha

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:32.910
 close to us is not health anymore, I said, put my brother bike rally on the other side

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:38.190
 what is all it is to contaminate everyone then the lips will change sent

00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:42.869
 to sneeze the health guy health is going to be like the other business point here i'm

00:44:42.869 --> 00:44:51.450
 longer here the half hour has already threatened and she spoke audio out there so the habits

00:44:51.450 --> 00:45:00.000
 let’s change hygiene habits habits of social interaction habits and we’ll

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.400
 live with this new lips and this new coronavirus like that

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:10.630
 when the vaccine arrives and if you have it today what cases

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:18.790
 scientifically proven etc etc. facilitates the containment of the virus more

00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:24.670
 or less will always exist as there is hiv as there are influenza viruses a

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:28.930
 influenza in so many other viruses and diseases that we take medicine but if

00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:34.030
 hiv not me hiv was in the past tang flowers hiv not that

00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:43.040
 but I used to take what was in that gvt it wasn’t it isn’t

00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:56.170
 hi mana say say it's ugly it's written it's hard this is this story

00:45:56.170 --> 00:46:01.310
 interesting to make a comparison what this shows that what we live this

00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:07.580
 pandemic to change, right? What happened is that people prepare more

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:14.570
 condoms decrease their their is social coexistence in some cases exchange

00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:18.980
 led screen to do the do to do the bar cut hair and color at the barber

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:23.360
 the gillette took off in the face of the new thing that doesn’t exist the guy cut his hair

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:27.230
 fan it's okay to use a razor it also gives a razor so these

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:33.290
 habits these changes can speak of hiv mia hiv continues to exist used

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:37.580
 if there is August, most of that silver is contaminated and the life that follows is

00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:41.990
 so it will also be with coronelismo and regrets all our already

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:45.660
 it's coming number 6 the first week week to arrive

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:51.030
 will probably come to life and look for a way to get away from this problem

00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:56.960
 today be the question there

00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:01.230
 the pills

00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:10.010
 health and you talk even in the amount of 4 million pills wanted to know

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:14.990
 exactly what is the quantity available to the ministry of health today

00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:19.310
 that you think there was a projection error if the government estimated

00:47:19.310 --> 00:47:26.160
 use a larger amount than what has actually been used and how it was

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:32.040
 and those pills came by government donations paid for that

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:37.950
 o and mainly with the resistance of the

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:43.349
 today this supply of chloroquine and what is going to be done then from that

00:47:43.349 --> 00:47:47.460
 minister material thank you good night my friend who is there is very happy to have

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:53.460
 a lot of stock but unfortunately our stock space is low and the

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:58.440
 most of them just for the record it costs practically nothing a color tablet o

00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:06.119
 that we are tempted and we actually meet a lot more demand than

00:48:06.119 --> 00:48:11.400
 spontaneous distribution in fact municipalities ask all the time to

00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:14.940
 distribution of our products and we have some logistics

00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:19.020
 very complicated, equal to the greatest difficulty in logistics and distribution

00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:26.099
 is not to buy a pill that costs a penny it is really to distribute

00:48:26.099 --> 00:48:32.820
 this here in asking so our our biggest goal is to really do

00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:37.930
 with whoever is really in need and wanting

00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:42.550
 and make it available on the medical network on the network to talk so that doctors can

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:48.099
 prescribe handing over the patient they may have that possibility there is a

00:48:48.099 --> 00:48:57.790
 we’re going to have a hard time touching them, we’re the other way around

00:48:57.790 --> 00:49:02.819
 people have found it very difficult to maintain the delivery of everyone who wants

00:49:02.819 --> 00:49:06.970
 enjoy the apron so you can get 4 million pills that some are so

00:49:06.970 --> 00:49:12.730
 finding that I stock exaggerate divide by half a dozen and each patient half

00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:20.339
 a dozen pills would give a dose to less than 700 thousand people minus 60 thousand people

00:49:20.339 --> 00:49:25.450
 so we have to have more I put it is still raining but still and more there

00:49:25.450 --> 00:49:30.700
 I accepted from the visitor the donation of 1 million pills that have not yet been

00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:34.000
 were distributed that his pack also has 100 pills from the pack

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.940
 kidnapped greater than the greatest life so curiosity o the mayor

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:43.520
 in mato grosso do sul trade has a video asked us for the medicine with the

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:47.210
 we sent there and then some servers I think we from the head of the

00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:51.290
 behind that some servers started another person there to receive it spoke here

00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:55.250
 the pill is not the president Bolsonaro who sent it right I do not send

00:49:55.250 --> 00:50:00.260
 nothing you gonna say hi it was the job you sent to jessica nor was you a disciple

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:04.540
 understanding the pills the present this trump of us has a density here

00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:08.510
 too much tablet there may be happiness and I have no problem I

00:50:08.510 --> 00:50:11.569
 call us are not kidding you have more send through call to come

00:50:11.569 --> 00:50:16.400
 get the brother from the plane here and we assign this material there

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:22.010
 for now it worked with me success with a lot of people and we have little here

00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:28.400
 too much this material eh routine exchange is used valeria're lupus arthritis

00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:34.570
 and also here is the doctor over there arthritis I think these three things are right

00:50:34.570 --> 00:50:43.460
 I'm going to let the people of Pingo Doce threads already 19:45

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:47.180
