 and we put votes there so that other fouls and immediately come if

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.490

 driver's license commission among so many others

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:59.920
 I regret to inform you that the provisional measure dealing with the

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.870
 contribution is union, that is, we had just finished

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.260
 union contribution ended in the following way right

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.180
 discount on payroll who wanted to pay the ticket and could continue to pay without

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:21.610
 no problem then maneuvers are there for those who are interested and the measure

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.940
 then the parties did not receive a list of members

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:39.820
 so when will it be voted and tomorrow will receive the automatic feature of the

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.680
 workers this gives approximately 3 billion per

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:51.610
 year in the hands of brazil despite the good nominees others we know what will

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:59.739
 do with money to picket a strike that has property to do

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.329
 barroso disturb those who produce brazil do not recognize some points of caxias

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:09.130
 time or another to another considerable part, but to prevent Brazil from going to

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.920
 ahead, this decision on the part of

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:18.039
 some leaders and act that way at least it wasn’t cro cro mp for

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:22.180
 plenary vote, I will let it expire due to lack of

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.450
 members' regrets regret I have in my opinion is because this

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.660
 so

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:37.599
 parents that we see there to solve this serious problem will now have to face,

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:44.319
 correction of the pension reform very soon they will meet with the

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:49.749
 oci general secretary is then also the president of the world bank

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:55.449
 it's one thing to say that the g20 is an opportunity not only to see the meeting

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.279
 of the g20 members is today the main agent has been in japan to clean up these

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:03.839
 parallel meetings will not only try to meet with the president of the

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:08.529
 general director of you give brazil is in this process of getting closer and

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:13.479
 adherence to senai and senar is an institution that brings a series of

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:18.969
 international standards and norms in the conduct of governance in the economy that

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:23.829
 it happens like in Brazil the best world standards, right?

00:05:23.829 --> 00:05:28.059
 we called the idea of ​​a rich countries fund today is no longer like that to the chorus of

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:32.110
 countries committed to responsible development with a

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.229
 solid economy so it's an opportunity for us too

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.519
 we will disclose we have forms in brazil and the investment opportunities

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:46.619
 when we are united I made this request adopting and he ready

00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:52.839
 agreed with our entry but it depends on your members of the penalty

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:59.199
 benjamin natanhahu the same thing israel we had the first chile also the

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:04.179
 same thing and in such a way that a feeling of ours for which we have neither information nor

00:06:04.179 --> 00:06:08.439
 it is against us entering six countries I am not mistaken and that wanting to enter the

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:12.249
 series a and the decision is from that select group that we want to enter

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:20.309
 we also have one of the g 20 today exact video is going to strive spoke one thing

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:27.899
 we will hear a lot of tiring things and remember the speech

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:40.749
 in addition to marketing actions so that they can help represent the

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:45.909
 Brazil in this situation but now not remembering that the g20 is a group of 20

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:51.370
 countries account for 90% of world GDP in 80 per cent in world trade and the

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.840
 brazil is a founding member of the g20 and latin america only argentina brazil and

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:03.879
 mexico - a smell is as a guest this friday the game is just remember too

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:08.949
 that we besides the g20 we have a meeting of the brics want 11 a meeting

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:15.909
 emerging countries in the case brazil russia china india and south africa will

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:20.500
 have an important meeting here because brazil will host aaa great meeting

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.909
 of the brics at the end of the year so it is important to put some

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:27.729
 subjects the brics is an entity was created

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:32.919
 exactly bringing countries together and a lot of meaning in the world and she and the brics is

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:37.960
 very important a political thing and to clarify why last night of

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.770
 trip I was asked a lot by some

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:47.229
 journalists who needed help writing this is already sold out for

00:07:47.229 --> 00:07:51.189
 talk to the journalist and one of the things I said was distorted from

00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:55.330
 profitably asked if that fact that happened

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:03.639
 in brazil about drugs having influenced the no g20 and i said look of course it is

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:09.279
 unlucky that this happened at the time of a meeting at

00:08:09.279 --> 00:08:14.879
 importance of the g20 and that this has occupied a large part of the press 0

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:22.330
 they twisted that fact they twisted a very cowardly way and said that I had

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:29.080
 said the military had had bad luck i'll say such nonsense

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.699
 what I meant is that the date was bad because an event of the greatest coincidence

00:08:33.699 --> 00:08:37.300
 this is the only thing I wanted to clarify because it is impressive the

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:41.979
 ability of some of our journalists to want to create a bad environment for the

00:08:41.979 --> 00:08:45.750
 country at an overseas event

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:51.220
 on the day before our trip, it’s already very clear when you have a

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:55.870
 trip of these is a schedule several actors cent to negotiate our trip

00:08:55.870 --> 00:09:01.150
 and they had decided that we would leave not on Tuesday but on Monday

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:06.220
 from brazil and return and not sunday we will send on sunday after lunch the

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:11.050
 decision was my final I didn’t leave the day after I arrived

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:16.120
 from before this also reflects the economy is really an overnight stay we have a

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.410
 entourage that is great right in something else when we arrived yesterday

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:25.300
 what was the decision she understands but this issue is the case of her here who traveled

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:29.560
 today to the whole world with the professional itamaraty the guidance of his team

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.570
 here when we arrived around two and

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:36.280
 mid-afternoon in japan is that we but everyone is tired but it wasn’t

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:41.950
 sleep because he went to sleep for 19 and 20 hours that would be seven in the morning today and

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.610
 tomorrow in brazil for us is exactly the next day

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:49.300
 no it's not sleepless at night to be rested a little bit the next day

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:54.160
 so his intention was for us to go for a walk that in osaka and

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:59.050
 we went here in a gallery between then it takes about an hour and a half or so

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:06.700
 well what the brazilian newspaper said we came to Japan to walk the alleged

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:11.200
 for the same day and a half and we would pass but at the aquino here in japan

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.310
 tool because what are you doing that is serious thing that moves millions of

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:19.030
 people in brazil brazil being well with others

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:25.750
 countries opening their markets as is the pole i guess lowering taxes opening the

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:29.260
 book market is good for everyone has another way to get a job

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:34.780
 who wants a job is not me i just want a job when when the

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:39.910
 people open a public competition or create a position in a commission where employment is the

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:44.680
 private initiative is the baker who is also an agriculturalist is the

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:50.950
 merchant is the liberal one just me our job does not hinder anyone

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:54.960
 want to produce does not hinder goes through measures will do

00:10:54.960 --> 00:11:02.070
 here we created here after partnerships is to count on the 20 most powerful in the

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:07.260
 world 90 economist thing here to help brazil in its transactions

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:11.760
 this is what we are doing here, joseph will end the matter here is so

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.000
 criticized during the campaign I talked so much about men

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.980
 so in japan and i said that here in japan there was even a web application for

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:28.850
 jewelery then touching little invoice

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:35.000
 we buy here have to be calm afterwards in the new factory there that he goes or

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.030
 exceed the limit here I will have to pay the difference here failed

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:43.260
 pay it I leave it there let the fame have a problem here look

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:48.030
 we have a little cord here, right and blue because the blue has several colors

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:52.680
 according to the land of the personal niobium makes the obvious right

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:59.310
 the advantage of this here in relation to gold and nobody has an alert reaction

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:05.190
 there is an obvious some have gold my mother put a white one on the ear of

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:12.090
 girl to girl and there is a reaction and this doesn’t have now you know how much I said in

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:19.080
 tour thousand dollars more or less 4 thousand reais that of gold

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:22.920
 I think it varies by weight, maybe worth three thousand reais in Brazil

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:32.400
 so look at jewelry in quotes, right, niobium being produced and sold here

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:38.070
 in japan still notice released around the world more at the price a little bit above

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:42.990
 from the same to the case it was gold, there are people who get old when I

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:47.790
 criticizing when I talk about buses the applications are many young people here

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:54.540
 just here the jewelery now a little something here too

00:12:54.540 --> 00:13:00.840
 the work is so that the Bahian woman is not entirely on behalf of the woman 150 doses

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:08.089
 more or less 600 150 instead 4 606

00:13:08.089 --> 00:13:16.230
 there are two there are two here is the expense here with the password of the gafi the woman then 150

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:23.850
 times 300 dollars 232 thousand two hundred reais of 600 reais each piece

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:29.339
 another advisor bought here and a June pendant also 20 years old always

00:13:29.339 --> 00:13:36.660
 put a mac man phone in that tank 150 doses more or less 600

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:41.399
 real no no I'm not doing so well on Saturday 4

00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:50.189
 so 600 reais in Catalan now that seems to have passed into the hands of the Japanese

00:13:50.189 --> 00:13:57.689
 was one of the last actions of its minister of mines and energy and has a

00:13:57.689 --> 00:14:06.029
 six-sided margin you know there a year I can only talk here

00:14:06.029 --> 00:14:23.569
 I talked about the detail is that you came here with our hotel here in partnership with us

00:14:23.569 --> 00:14:29.910
 he stayed here on a commercial scale, it’s like a hobby that he does

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:34.170
 what he does other things is concerned with and now produce a collider

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:44.880
 linear hospitalization of obvious tell you but Brazil is a very rich country

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:51.870
 I'm not going to talk about graphene, it's not cool in Brazil, a very rich country has

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:57.449
 everything to work out depends on our union and deputies and senators agent of the

00:14:57.449 --> 00:15:06.629
 public prosecutors and the judiciary of the union everyone pointing out the same

00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:15.360
 direction we have 50 we have the world has no more problems

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.760
 here when I saw the deal of 6

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:22.500
 is the environment environmental preservation nobody will tape the new president

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:26.730
 already moved does not represent Brazil and period who wants to argue with me

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:31.740
 know about the environment are to talk to discuss is the country that most preserves the

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:36.450
 environment in the world and the one that least uses pesticides products that have a staff

00:15:36.450 --> 00:15:43.440
 that whenever the girl in agriculture arrives at the regional

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:48.660
 rural producers abuse is not notorious if abused if the world here where I’m not

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:54.060
 bought the products do things is not discussed there is a lot

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:58.620
 Brazil that uses less botox is one of the countries with the highest productivity in the

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:04.920
 world and competes with the united states and many products right from the personal field

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:08.430
 our passage here and if god wants it will be all right said the attendant

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:12.870
 yesterday's ride was very productive in time to publicize the presence of the

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:18.230
 Brazilian president here at g 20 a lot of people approached the president

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:22.470
 even a lot maybe without knowing it was when they knew it was for example the

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:26.130
 Brazil had an extremely affectionate treatment, very well liked in the

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:31.470
 japan we have a huge colony that about 200,000 brazilian this was very

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:35.970
 important what the president had an almost unanimous vote in japan so

00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:43.200
 this stroll among stars was sent here so she will find power instituted

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:48.840
 The wait is 30 hours of travel, which was very good as advertising for Brazil.

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:55.470
 that recognized Japanese bolt takes about one hundred 1964 photos two of the sidewalk that

00:16:55.470 --> 00:17:00.690
 quickly shows the affection that the Japanese people have towards us I met with

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:04.350
 some Brazilians and the black night also hit that it was a steakhouse of

00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:10.170
 Brazilians here now look at a Brazilian steakhouse where the house

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:15.730
 where the campaign in case brazil doesn’t enter here we’re going to work hard

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:20.350
 working here I don't want to blame anyone in the past but in the past when the

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:25.209
 concern since he holds the presidency is who is who is who

00:17:25.209 --> 00:17:31.120
 dedicated the beginning of the foreign relations shared of calm to

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:36.669
 that we value itamaraty is there someone trained with you and that the

00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:42.400
 accompany people like you do not have aliens in itamaraty the defense has a

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:49.330
 general in health has a doctor in the court and the judge where one more in the middle

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:53.500
 this year ricardo salles is right that's how it is not that we

00:17:53.500 --> 00:18:01.929
 we do and the meat correction here talk I think the night was breakfast

00:18:01.929 --> 00:18:06.340
 morning is because it was not adapted to it so how does xuxa imagine you eating

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:11.799
 barbecue seven in the morning wouldn’t work right I don’t know how many work right now

00:18:11.799 --> 00:18:18.640
 yes we will work so that our cani comes here to japan is not this is

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.809
 important that I still don't think the Brazilian wants to show that the consumption of

00:18:22.809 --> 00:18:26.620
 Brazilian chicken meat pork here are very high

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:29.620
 now very high consumption now meat consumption

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:33.460
 we are going to work in this direction, there is no reason why brazil doesn’t export meat

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:38.010
 with japan there is going to be a job i know what is existing is the tractor and it will

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:43.150
 there will probably be a blow to the head in a violent hit right not the week

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:47.559
 had a problem for the hospital from where the girls so command more as well

00:18:47.559 --> 00:18:53.669
 an excellent beauty of the 31-year-old woman in the family

00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:59.700
 let's go to work let's disclose something that matters to our country let's go

00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:03.910
 taking a hit that I have any business is a hit but you know it will

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:09.970
 be until the end of our mandate and pledged to take brazil from samsung

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:14.010
 brazil cup now but i wanted to highlight presidents allows the

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:18.640
 potential of japan's cooperation is a great technological power is also

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:22.299
 a small country that complement each other in brazil a giant in capturing the third

00:19:22.299 --> 00:19:25.660
 with number 106 in the world abundant capital brazil needs

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:30.460
 investments and that an elementary age of the two countries have a great future

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:35.170
 have a lot to work here in the country we have the biggest mush the biggest colony

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:39.850
 Japanese now outside Japan this also allows me to remember that

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:43.690
 now in brussels is negotiating a trade liberalization agreement with

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:47.200
 european union catherine ashton ana cristina palau minister najib balala

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:51.820
 a ministry secretary like no professional technical staff working

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:56.950
 with us that came from a concrete mixer came to use the famous for us more

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:02.590
 we are going to face big so much in note we here the strokes keeps has come is

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:07.210
 a demonstration that we're right my social today's episode is

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:11.530
 a joke, right? answered who will pay the staff?

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:17.460
 the open investigation and he all collaboration with the spanish police

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:23.890
 that thanked the Spanish government here publicly for having detained the element and

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:29.200
 did not stop the crew imagine i believe it would be a total

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:35.040
 of 178 people over 10 that other part of the crew is that

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:42.310
 would catch me will really serve this other military was arrested is the plane that

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:48.280
 it even takes the population to replace the people but in any case

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:53.800
 way if there were grandchildren in a fault of ours then our plane is with

00:20:53.800 --> 00:21:00.820
 everyone is searched and even mine my trip is searched and never

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:04.810
 I was told this gift could be revised I already know that it is for those

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:09.850
 is with the signal no problem has it is and we trust that between

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:12.730
 we on this mission regret that element there

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:17.350
 that from what everything looks like from what everything seems for some time involved in this

00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:22.060
 that nobody on a first trip will mount 39 kilos of narcotics and

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:28.720
 we will investigate this element entered there at levels similar to the last two

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:34.500
 governments that pass and extended to the federal police to our intelligence

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:41.670
 the Spanish police will arrive and in those that really matter to

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:47.010
 that this element here in Brazil for 30 years in jail as a heinous crime he

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:52.080
 will meet the 20 to be able to require progression if you stay here I think the

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.980
 time don't miss spain i don't know but if you stay here complication said

00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:02.040
 if it were in indonesia there in indonesia the death penalty as in the past i have

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:05.310
 a drug dealer in bringing the prisoner and kept the promise I don't remember was the

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:11.760
 dilma squid asked that squid is coming back to Brazil he didn't have liquor and I went and went

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:19.170
 executed as a result of indonesia a 100% safe country because it made

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:24.690
 going down there pays even when you talk about drug dealers, you know, and there were 30 -

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:28.580
 families are destroyed with this quality at the time

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:39.390

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:46.610

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:51.450
