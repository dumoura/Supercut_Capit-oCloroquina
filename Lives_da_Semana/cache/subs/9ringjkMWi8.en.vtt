00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:08.250
tomorrow is good night everyone today is thursday 12th of december at 9

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.070
 hours we are at rio de janeiro airport

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.639
 santos dumont a little bit quicker today that we have a commitment to

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.230
 20 hours at the military engineering institute where the course here is weighing

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.160
 for exactly five years 50 years did a l currently the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.500
 our gift from the bnds and then changed his mind in the year has already changed the president is a

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.820
 five months there and it has already changed he even told me that he doesn’t have

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.649
 nothing irregular in the illegal bbb10 illegal because there is the beginning of charity

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.579
 with someone else's hat started inside parliament exactly the measures

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.739
 provisional with a bill of laws and agreed and then the bds executed but

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.180
 so it was a one way to use obey but it is smart exact bank

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:06.450
 a president power really is less than the box works here we at

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.479
 the federal fund is talking about economics

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.830
 I think it's worth it has something new is our right here our interpreter of

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.030
 pounds the lucas quick thing like I learned to

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.290
 warm up very regrettably in that accident

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.570
 occurred with a hercules c-130 plane from chile that talks about the tactic really fell

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:39.030
 at sea the Brazilian ship that was in the next region did not go to the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.180
 region of the possible accident ended up finding wreckage of the c 130 with

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.130
 parts of human bodies un-habitat regrets god comforts the family and

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.170
 congratulates our Brazilian Navy for their promptness in this help

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.659
 humanitarian our Chilean brothers

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:05.909
 economy the selic rate I remember when the confusion was made

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.770
 causing a constituent to set the maximum limit of 12%

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.770
 went ahead there is the most varied allegations possible a vote was taken

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.380
 proposal of the song and left free and in the government fernando henrique cardoso arrived

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.190
 hitting around 60 percent the selic rate close to 60% is because this

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.540
 had as a remedy to fight inflation increase religious to that

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.050
 medicine worked at the time it wasn’t too heavy for the president as well

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.459
 heavy that the domestic debt increased alarmingly where we have 4 trillion

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:51.750
 of domestic debt this year and this year here we are

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.860
 paying by completing the year by paying approximately 400 billion reais of

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.450
 interest interest gives more than 1 billion a day

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.010
 but everyone to feel the size of the problem in this because to think what the

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.360
 Brazil took out a loan last year to pay another 1 billion for

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.489
 interest day is growth on top of selic rate well the selic rate now without

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.340
 any interference from the executive branch has now been set at four and

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.609
 half a second according to roberto campos at the central bank said that by staying

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:33.959
 this fee next year we must pay in the year 2020 - 110

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.459
 billions of reais so I don’t think the advantage and going out

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:44.549
 for all of us Brazilians and what are the positive reflexes

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.680
 better to say that pedro isamu the positive in this lower interest rate

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.740
 today is president we announced three more reductions in the morning

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:02.070
 in interest rates we once again reduced mortgage loans

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:10.020
 so we started the year around 9% and now we reach 6 6 percent one

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.660
 very significant reduction in nuclear transit by reducing g and new check

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:22.860
 special remembers that we were conventions in the function to enter with 1 13% to the

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:34.230
 month and now we announce at 4.95 the wall there i have ancestry you

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:40.890
 in the past a president and interfered in those numbers and you resolved

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:48.240
 reduce these numbers in the case here the interest of the overdraft or I ask you

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.800
 you win is you are gaining customers because of that resumption measure started

00:04:52.800 --> 00:05:00.450
 there in the last 45 days we have over a million customers among credit cards

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:06.600
 credit among individual customers, among other insurance operations

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:13.590
 cashier has never been so strong from a marketing standpoint because the population

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:19.800
 Today, the Brazilian bank is aware that both the bank and the social bank do the

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.390
 payments of r 10 in others as well as the bank

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:30.660
 leads in Brazil the reduction of the interest rate is the real estate credit of traia

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.180
 was when jader josé assumed around 9 tr plus 9% but for

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:43.650
 simplify because the land is 0 9% currently 6 thousand so if anyone wants to

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.290
 buy your own house the best in the savings bank and your perspective you

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:56.340
 should even more or less profit the box never had so much in why

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.320
 because there is another very important issue when you reduce the rate of

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:07.110
 interest is to increase the size of the portfolio and reduce defaults

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:13.410
 in other words, president pay 13% per month [Music]

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:19.710
 only the press goes to 40 percent when you charge 4 and a half

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.840
 press reduces a lot so you get the overdraft on the other side the cashier

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:31.430
 is 4.9 the other banks average 13% the campaign from the box up and I just

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:37.170
 just opened an account there campaigning is not the question of credit

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.320
 real estate the other banks at the time of 7 6 by

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.540
 percent a year the box is 6 and 6 1 percent is a lot to reinforce the

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:51.360
 sir spoke neither my municipal chief dr the chief of sir is did any

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.669
 interference doesn’t have much of an issue for me when using robots

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:01.040
 that president roberto the president of the bank of brazil is that we have a

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.400
 independence we are very close we are a team and

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.990
 we believe in the same ideal we believe in very important loyalty

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.280
 so in my opinion this makes a difference is incredible because we

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:21.630
 we are confident that we can be 100% is a motorcycle using here such a

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.530
 around two and a half months in front of the presidency and five months and finally

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:30.919
 until the 16th it's been five months now let's go fast when you

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:37.020
 he assumed he talked to me he talked from para ufpa colleagues from the bank is also

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:42.450
 that happened to be your goal ahead of the president bnds i put five goals

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:47.160
 ahead of benesse first goal explain the black box second goal

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.650
 repay the treasury in order to reduce interest selling the shareholdings

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:56.490
 speculative improve the service the bank provides to the Brazilian government and

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:01.020
 make a business plan focused on the social in the port touch on the subject here

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:06.750
 if any one of the people wants to see that one in the black box, how is it

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:12.360
 it does it goes now in a simple way on the site open point well 10.9 point br

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:18.419
 open dot bds dot gov.br she goes to the website simple bid clear explanatory and

00:08:18.419 --> 00:08:22.440
 people can answer questions and get that money

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:29.150
 seeks to know how much I went with what percentage and with guarantee was given for

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:35.010
 the loan was certainly borrowed 656 million

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:38.669
 of dollars from mariel port of biggest question for him to take advantage of the window

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:43.919
 there is what cuba produces to have first class air force comfort

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:46.230
 Portuguese which produces vat exports

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:50.610
 find another toucan guy my people there that an average salary of 20

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:53.970
 dollars the dough what these people have to do

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:59.700
 to be able to buy the imported one has to be able to go to this so that this point of

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:06.779
 first there was for sure the ideological question guarantee sign the

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:12.240
 total iron in the third not in the channel of the channel that the company calls

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.010
 channel presidency is the channel dictator does not pay the country that has not been paying right

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:21.240
 then we will take it says should take a default as the president of 561

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.950
 million dollars that is preventing the 204 just over two billion

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:32.450
 years we tested 656 still paying the bill we here what are you listening to then

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:38.070
 now I go over here over there now the business is how is it how is it

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:42.920
 that the bank provides a loan from this pro knowing that as there is no way to pay

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:47.640
 is to convince the president of the bnds of the time to make a very simple loan

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.070
 President, this loan was endorsed by the

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.700
 National treasure

00:09:53.089 --> 00:10:02.160
 we all of us the people that amorim ahead will talk more about the bnds he the package

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.930
 anti-wall crisis was approved i will listen to the world now because it suffered

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:11.490
 change the bed and see what we might be thinking I think it's you stay

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:17.850
 connected to a device of this cream design and triples the penalty for those who

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:21.900
 commit the crime of libel, defamation and injury and julia node on social media

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:27.720
 but the hell that goes on scene i'm willing to veto that's it but we

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.450
 will follow thales here to see that the people think

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:35.620
 I must sanction I can take into account that

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:43.899
 you are putting it there now in the week hurry said that I would be playing the

00:10:43.899 --> 00:10:51.640
 sanction if congress approved two and a half billion for the electoral fund and

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:58.180
 not 3,800 make it very clear I didn’t touch on this subject this press doesn’t tire of

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.240
 lie the guy wants to know points the line goes

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:06.339
 veto or sanction what happens there September when we vote abuse here

00:11:06.339 --> 00:11:09.279
 of authority hadn’t even gotten mine to take a

00:11:09.279 --> 00:11:14.680
 hit already proves in anticipation came to study we listen to four girls

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:19.209
 interested in this area attends all - we vetoed the congress overthrew the majority

00:11:19.209 --> 00:11:24.399
 of the ten boat topics, right, I can't do anything more than that

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:29.019
 there are some more exalted ones that I can interfere in the legislature in the judiciary

00:11:29.019 --> 00:11:34.750
 can intervene in a very hurt time and I don’t even want to leave isn’t part of the

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:39.880
 democracy triumphed doctor earned as had a fake don't know i would be

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.670
 with cancer this morning and is running for a

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:46.959
 little video as always talk to the press today the press prepared the

00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:50.860
 question i will not answer anything because it started with the top tires water for

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.660
 home does not give an interview to him is lie on top of lies

00:11:54.660 --> 00:12:02.140
 woefully big for our print media and one made in the week that I

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:08.110
 wanted a return to lisbon union and would have put a line in order to

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:13.089
 working towards the faith was a rapporteur of a similar project we overturned

00:12:13.089 --> 00:12:17.800
 union strength that the back so that money for the union wants to say something

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:24.370
 thing must do I think the union will do a good job right

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:28.140
 the employee will pay voluntarily

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:34.660
 your contribution was the boleto also let's go ahead

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:41.740
 we started paying the day before yesterday the 10th of the 13th of the family allowance to the one

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:46.150
 governor was talking any not to controversy filled with optimism and joe

 pt in the senate is buried filed this bill accordingly makes it very clear

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:14.380
 which is the resource to pay 10 he much of the fight against fraud is very common

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.890
 see how to do a survey there because it is not well defined the

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:20.920
 criteria for granting a family allowance

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:26.260

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:38.920
 la packs of montesano cream that sent half of st to talk to us

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.960
 the president will now be a bank focused on how Brazilian the bank

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:48.670
 formerly then playing previous ones or knowing very well how ana was

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:52.150
 focused on financial profit the bank had to make a high profit and is with the company

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:53.830
 great now we're here for the better

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:57.640
 improve citizens' lives don't go sanitation lower the price of gas they put

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:01.990
 in public action so picking up that bank is focused on big heavy and the

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:05.440
 subsidized empathy and focus on improving the life of the Brazilian focused on the purpose

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.290
 in profit I have my son of them is very

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:15.620
 important that I see I see and the price of nickel is not easy

00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:21.500
 is puc to study outside brazil championship off the field that i wanted

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:26.990

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:32.990
 the proof of the pisa is in english that the pisa is one in an educational pot

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:38.480
 three-dimensional education day the student assessment activity is done in

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:43.820
 three years the first test was done in 2000 with about 70 countries

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:50.390
 take proof of Portuguese mathematics and science of the kids than 15 years of

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:56.600
 our case here is in the 9th grade of elementary school and it was done then

00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:03.860
 three years right 1823 right last year in April was

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:09.290
 done one more test of the pilot result of now part of the media put on my

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:17.029
 account of the step test because it fell in relation to the last three-year period

00:15:17.029 --> 00:15:21.650
 great advantage now or in the future in Brazil never again because it came to

00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:26.600
 studying is like that game of those who lose will not win who she will

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.589
 losing flamenco and avaí it has not resulted flamengo is first place

00:15:30.589 --> 00:15:35.089
 I will be at the last one here the floor has reached this point now so we are

00:15:35.089 --> 00:15:38.810
 playing hard to change that there is nothing to do with the government at the end of

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:45.250
 accounts we want to improve the quality of teaching as messing with school

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:50.660
 stimulating the teacher to teach what really matters classroom today I

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.830
 I spoke in the northeast in some universities some adversity

00:15:54.830 --> 00:16:00.410
 the student does everything but history I think it is wrong because the level there isn’t

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:04.510
 proves to step on the university girl I don't know

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:10.180
 of the line but the training is not good a local school where it is possible to learn

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:14.410
 a profession will leave a good professional good boss or employee if

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:19.000
 it is not but who understands it really is from your position I'm kind of wanted

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.560
 sit put in my account this if practically in last place

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.920
 in this area of ​​south america one of the last in the world

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:31.150
 in this collection here is sad for us china is in first place so

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:35.080
 that china imports it imports good stuff from all over the world how important is our

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:38.020
 meat some complain about the price with safe

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:42.100
 really on the subject but every year at that time november / december

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:47.010
 off-season there is an increase in meat not as much as it was now but that there is

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:53.650
 this increase and the rural producer that for years almost ten years was without profit

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:57.250
 zero to zero now it's important never selling out well what's up

00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:02.320
 happening also to see again the man in the field is investing more in

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:07.780
 livestock that in a few months the tendency is to return this to normality

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:11.370
 some even charge me on the internet for an interest rate table or the

00:17:11.370 --> 00:17:18.400
 reservation worked today the treasure sold 600 right there doesn't even have a dog

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:25.180
 but to eat the cat, everyone's ok and the same as the senate in

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:30.490
 shovel misery are not going to do this here is we want and we are going to open our market in

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:34.990
 all over the world we import and make the price of meat very clear

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:39.430
 increased only here in brazil not uruguay paraguay in argentina in

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:44.070
 united states very wrong even china

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:51.200
 reinforce it is rescuing that s of the bené speaks in an adhesion thank you very much

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.780
 newspaper we are remembering a very present

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:59.360
 elevated by general heleno that ben 10 and ends with ss of social is of

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:04.340
 singh health sanitation that help most spoke to me very well of the baby is

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:08.929
 here to say yes to the people and ssd at the service of the brazilian people we are a

00:18:08.929 --> 00:18:13.400
 bank of economic and social development and we are here for this not only

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.990
 to close the large company but without imagining the citizen

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:21.140
 a curiosity is that it already talks about education right

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:26.510
 the Congress decided not to speak mentha tighten the bill forcing that

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:30.320
 all public schools have a psychologist a social worker a touch

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:35.630
 touch that was approved I vetoed I took a blow the psychopath doesn’t want anymore

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:38.780
 personal details there is such a law of

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:44.870
 fiscal responsibility that I cannot create expense without there being a forecast

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:48.289
 of resources for this is very simple i'll was a victim

00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:53.049
 then it will be a party in an understanding of mine right

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:56.690
 imagine what will happen to brazil gvt's actions

00:18:56.690 --> 00:19:01.510
 now I want to do the congress overturned the veto

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:08.059
 I will kick students here close to 200 thousand schools in Brazil two people each

00:19:08.059 --> 00:19:14.320
 one but two thousand and 400 thousand jobs

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:28.610
 so it’s not that I don’t want to, I won’t even discuss the possibility because it doesn’t

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:35.929
 I can, I have a limit and that's it, so this project, in my opinion, does not

00:19:35.929 --> 00:19:42.080
 it was a reasonable project brings false hope what will happen now

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.920
 regardless of my desire to lose in the same

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:49.610
 going to be questioned with nothing but the supreme federal court going to be tried

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:54.800
 functional and went back to square one and it may be that one day we will have this only

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:59.120
 it would be very good but now in the current situation it is real only going to take out has a sister

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:04.250
 that the psychologist so who did she also say that I should create jobs on top

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:13.940
 on top of me most notably is not going to be that piece that way it was not the day

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:18.980
 pedro do not attend the propaganda and five hundred reais to who had the right to

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:21.980
 guarantee fund and fetch money a lot of famous people that was little is certain

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:29.000
 but a lot of people also liked the i'm going to ask to increase the limit will pass

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.840
 to 993 if you are completing another number that was done by then yesterday the

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:43.190
 water and the mind is will print the date hand the federal savings bank will

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:49.070
 make this payment on December 20, that is to say Friday without success

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:55.940
 the other on December 20, 10 million Brazilians

00:20:55.940 --> 00:21:00.370
 2.6 billion grandchildren so this is an important point

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:05.840
 President the box is fully prepared with you

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:10.490
 family and 13th the box the bank of social policies

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:14.710
 this will have people manage to pay very peacefully

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:18.710
 on the last lap I think it's worth it because it has to do with security

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:22.220
 public in that so look at me is integrally the

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:25.190
 project of the same week a congress voted no

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:32.510
 was elected but more or less the following to be quite objective the smallest once

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:40.340
 suffered an aggression from an adult one to an adult he he was represented by

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:46.630
 parents at the police station from now on with this project if

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:51.890
 it became a law and does not depend on the parents' will then

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:55.010
 any news from the newspaper of a minor assault

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:59.929
 the prosecutor's office brought action against this evil

00:21:59.929 --> 00:22:05.330
 the mp and dependent on the manifestation of the parents

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:12.230
 the secretary the least who has suffered an attack nor I vetoed

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:17.300
 the project had people who think I was wrong because we should not defend the

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:22.610
 child in brazil the little child up to 17 years old

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:27.590
 so if the economist who spoke when I can continue can continue on

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:30.920
 campaign the channel is there we are

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:35.240
 legally economist of ipea what happens is that is the video imagine

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:42.380
 any police action where the minor is detained is assaulted until

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:48.940
 verbal will already be prosecuted the mp goes to him would not be missing

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:55.340
 some zones right these part of technicians you know right from the left and just do the

00:22:55.340 --> 00:23:00.200
 search around to represent to find a fair way and so that this police

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:06.320
 would undergo an inventory process so because of that but

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:12.470
 it still has nothing to do with the authors it was nothing to swear to know who is the

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:18.710
 author of this project gleise hoffmann repeat gleise hoffmann

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:23.840
 very worried about minors maybe after the squid politician said that only

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.230
 because the kid is stealing his cell phone, go to the police to implement it

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:33.350
 example leaves the mother to steal and peace rapporteur of the project in the chamber reported

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:37.830
 to bed the maria session of the rosary swims against the

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:43.950
 her name but we veto the project for the sake of public safety and really prove

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:47.820
 police can work work in peace

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:53.640
 when you have in front of you is 11 minor offender it’s only yesterday to close because

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.820
 we have is a graduation in its half and engineering

00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:02.430
 let's review the school event tva that five years ago she will buy only

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:06.390
 but also something longer just to close the president yesterday that

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:10.110
 paid the treasure 30 billion reais are not in my can I had

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:16.290
 committed 126 thousand paying 62 and a half then year but that issued it and helps the

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:21.480
 interest will drop to 46 payments next year this when

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:28.590
 the rate would be close to inflation if that debt amount does not

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:33.360
 grows does not untie presents itself in the economy even though it has the worst is that

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.840
 if you are not here the daughter called I think the name is working because I

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:40.560
 I don’t understand it’s because people trust their president the government could only

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:45.150
 being the sock took the tea is no use I will enter the operating room at

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:49.290
 does anyone think it flies because I'm captain artillery captain without doing

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:52.410
 exactly the opposite I ask for something better I want

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:59.550
 thank you and the cashier again every time the central bank cuts interest

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:05.060
 one day later we will be mathematically

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:11.220
 reductions in the consumer has no chance I think it almost arrived

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:15.810
 limit the 40 a little way down even today inflation has fallen

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:25.950
 more clearance have a chance to decrease below the overdraft has 144 89

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:30.000
 I think in the future it can decrease until Monday the dog yes I just complain to

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.010
 damn and 14% the box is the box 35 gives for the month

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:40.680
 yes it is just an important point with the leadership of Mr. luiz paulo who is

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:46.080
 this roberto costa the president of the central bank the more the rules of the game and

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:53.460
 households plus confidence and the interest rate still at which the brethren brazil

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:57.720
 so I hope so with more confidence we will be more

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:02.400
 times is our image and modern sound pedro lucas

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:08.480
