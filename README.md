# Political Remix

A project that focuses on the Youtube video verbal content to "sampling" and "remixing" is based on specific queries. 

Based on the script "Supercut_Capit√£oCloroquina," Jair Bolsonaro's statements on Amazonia, Indigenous people, Covid-19, etc., were sampled and mixed on a supercut.
